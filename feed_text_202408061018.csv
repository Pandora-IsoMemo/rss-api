Follow the latest business news here or read through the updates below. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm, slashed Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink’s pay by 30% to $25.2 million for 2022, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The move comes after the money manager reported first-quarter revenue that was down 10% from a year ago, as rising interest rates and economic uncertainty impacted the firm’s bottom line. “With respect to 2022 compensation, management determined to reduce the impact of the firm’s decline in profitability on BlackRock’s broader employee population by concentrating the downward adjustments to total incentive awards toward senior management,” the filing said. Total compensation for Fink, 70, included a base salary of $1.5 million and $23.7 million in total incentive awards. Several other executives saw their compensation reduced, including Rob Kapito, the firm’s president, whose package shrank by 34% to $18.95 million. UBS’ purchase of Credit Suisse’s US subsidiaries can move forward, the Federal Reserve said Friday. The statement comes a month after UBS stepped in to rescue the embattled Swiss lender and prevent turmoil in the financial sector from spreading, after an emergency loan of nearly $54 billion from the Swiss National Bank failed to stop the carnage. The problems for Credit Suisse began when the Saudi National Bank, its largest backer, said it wouldn’t put up more cash after buying a nearly 10% stake in the bank for $1.5 billion in 2022. Banking customers were already on edge after the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank — so Credit Suisse shares tumbled more than 25% and saw billions of dollars of outflows. The global turmoil has led US lawmakers to call for tighter regulations on banks. The Fed board said UBS will provide a quarterly updated plan for combining UBS’s and Credit Suisse’s US business and operations. “The implementation plan will address UBS’s obligations to comply with more stringent enhanced prudential standards, including liquidity standards,” the Fed said in a statement. UBS is shelling out 3 billion Swiss francs, or $3.25 billion, for Credit Suisse. Stocks slid Friday after a slate of earnings beats from big banks fueled concerns that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its next two meetings. Still, the major indices gained for the week. The Dow rose 400 points, or 1.2%. The S&P 500 gained 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.3%. JPMorgan Chase on Friday reported first-quarter profit and revenue that crushed expectations, boosted by the Fed’s interest rate hiking campaign. Citigroup, Wells Fargo and PNC Financial also reported strong results. CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors in the company’s post-earnings conference call that they should prepare for interest rates to be higher for longer than expected. Wall Street seems to have taken note. Analysts increased their bets on a quarter-point rate hike at the Fed’s meeting in May and another in June. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Friday that the central bank needs to continue tightening monetary policy, further weighing down markets. Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said that it’s “definitely” possible the United States enters a mild recession after the tumult in banking last month. Meanwhile, retail sales data declined more than expected, suggesting that Americans’ spending power and the US economy are weakening. Consumer sentiment held fairly steady in April, even as concerns about a recession linger, according to the University of Michigan’s latest monthly survey. “There was too much news to digest this morning, but the key takeaway is that the Fed has room to do more harm,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, said in a note. The Dow slipped 144 points, or 0.4%. The S&P 500 tumbled 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite sank 0.4%. As stocks settle after the trading day, levels might still change slightly. Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said Friday he isn’t discounting the recent assessment from central bank economists that the banking crisis will tip the United States into a mild recession later this year. “There’s no way you can look at current conditions around the world and in the US and not think that some mild recession is definitely on the table as a possibility,” Goolsbee said Friday during an interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” He added that, when viewed historically, the monetary tightening campaign undertaken by the Fed — hiking interest rates nine times in just over a year — is expected to slow GDP growth. “When you get numbers like retail sales and others that are declining, if you look at construction, I think we’ve got to think about what’s the state of growth in the country,” he said. “Fortunately, the labor market continues to be very strong.” Critics have lambasted the World Bank and, particularly, the International Monetary Fund, for predicting Russia’s economy would hold relatively stable this year despite international sanctions. But sanctions are hurting Russia’s economy, even if World Bank forecasts don’t reflect it, according to the outgoing World Bank President David Malpass. Speaking to Julia Chatterley at the IMF-World Bank spring conference, David Malpass responded to criticism that you couldn’t trust GDP and economic data from Russia. He admitted “the quality of the data differs substantially by country…the reality is there’s not very much in terms of double checking of data”. In January, the IMF projected that Russia’s economy would expand by 0.3% this year and 2.1% the next. That was much more optimistic than the latest forecasts from the World Bank, which still penciled in a contraction of just 3.3% this year. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development was the most pessimistic, forecasting a 5.6% contraction in Russia’s economy in 2023. Malpass said that GDP numbers were not capturing the “reality” and “horror” of the war, and noted the Russian economy was suffering. “I think life is hard in Russia…they’re excluded from travelling to many parts of the world, their supply chains have to change dramatically… young people moving out because they don’t want to be part of this war,” Malpass said. Consumer sentiment tracked by the University of Michigan held steady in April, according to a preliminary reading released Friday. So far, the university’s monthly surveys have shown a limited impact from the banking crisis on consumers’ attitudes, but Americans remain concerned about an upcoming recession and some lingering fears about inflation persist. “Consumers are expecting a downturn, they’re not feeling as dismal as they were last summer, but they’re waiting for the other shoe to drop,” said Joanne Hsu, director of the surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan, in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Friday morning. “We now have about a month of data following the collapse of SVB, and there hasn’t really been much of an effect on sentiment at all,” she said. The latest survey also showed that higher gas prices helped push up year-ahead inflation expectations by a full percentage point, rising from 3.6% in March to 4.6% in April. “Consumers are still feeling the pain of high prices,” Hsu told Bloomberg, noting that survey respondents were now mentioning gas prices for the first time since fall. The latest cooldown in consumer and producer price hikes as well as the latest decline in retail sales are indications that the Federal Reserve’s efforts are working to bring down high inflation, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee told CNBC on Friday. “You don’t want to overreact to short-run news, but it feel likes like that’s moving in the right direction,” he said during an appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” Goolsbee was quick to note that an area of critical importance to him in advance of the next Fed meeting is activity in banking and credit. Earlier this week, Goolsbee noted that the Fed needs to be “on watch” for tighter credit conditions as a result of the banking turmoil last month. He referenced private sector analyst estimates that the spillover effects of the crisis equate to the Fed enacting rate hikes anywhere from a quarter point to three-quarters of a point. “I’m an old-school data dog,” Goolsbee said Friday. “What I would do is spend the next three weeks getting out and figuring out how much credit tightening is coming.” Chief executives at some of the largest banks in the United States were forced to address the elephant in the room as they reported first-quarter earnings on Friday morning: The regional banking crisis that brought Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank to ruin last month. > Banking industry turmoil has added to risks of recessionary “storm clouds” on the horizon, said JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon Friday in a release. He added that “the banking situation is distinct from 2008 as it has involved far fewer financial players and fewer issues that need to be resolved.” Still, said Dimon, who leads the country’s largest bank, “financial conditions will likely tighten as lenders become more conservative, and we do not know if this will slow consumer spending.” >“We are glad to have been in a strong position to help support the US financial system during the recent events that impacted the banking industry,” commented Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf in a statement. “Regional and community banks are an important part of our financial system and are uniquely positioned to serve their customers and communities.” > “I believe today’s crisis of confidence in the regional banking sector will further accelerate capital markets growth, and BlackRock will be a central player,” wrote BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on Friday. “Increased financing through the capital markets will require the scale, multi-asset capabilities and excellence in portfolio construction that BlackRock consistently delivers across market cycles,” he said in a statement. That means bad news for regional banks could be good news for BlackRock – the lack of trust in regional banks will drive more investment into capital markets and BlackRock is poised to benefit as that happens. “Throughout our history, moments of market dislocation and disruption have served as inflection points for BlackRock,” he explained. Regulators also hired BlackRock in early April to help the US government in the sale of the $114 billion in assets it collected from the collapse> Citigroup and PNC did not address the banking crisis in their releases, but will likely answer questions about how they’ve weathered the turmoil and what they see ahead at their first-quarter presentations, planned for 11 a.m. ET. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors Friday not to be caught unawares if interest rates stay higher longer than expected. “People need to be prepared. They shouldn’t pray that they don’t go up. They should prepare for them going up. And if it doesn’t happen, serendipity,” Dimon said on the company’s post-earnings conference call. High interest rates have helped big banks, including JPMorgan Chase, since they widen the gap between the interest paid to customers and what they earn from investing that money. But climbing rates also helped drive last month’s collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which held 55% of its customers deposits in long-dated bonds whose value diminished as interest rates rose. Dimon stated that he believes the banking crisis will pass — even though he expects its effects to reverberate through the sector for years to come — but that the possibility of higher interest rates should remain on companies’ radars. “If and when that happens, it will address problems in the economy. For those who are too exposed to floating rates, or those who are too exposed to [refinancing] risk, those exposures will be in multiple parts of the economy,” Dimon said. “Now would be the time to fix it. Do not put yourself in a position where that risk is excessive for your company, your business, your investment pools,” he said. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the largest US bank, told investors Friday that he isn’t too worried about a credit crunch resulting from the recent banking crisis. “I wouldn’t use the word[s] ‘credit crunch,’” he said in response to a question about whether he was worried that lending would tighten in the bank after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. There will be “a little bit of tightening,” said Dimon, but that will mostly be contained within the real estate market. Dimon added that he’s more worried about recession than a credit crunch. “I just look at it as a kind of a thumb on the scale. It just makes the financing conditions a little bit tighter and increases the odds of a recession,” he said. “That’s what that is. It’s not like a credit crunch.” JPMorgan Chase said Friday its exposure to the office sector is limited, addressing concerns about the commercial real estate industry’s stability. “Given the recent focus on commercial real estate, let me remind you that our office sector exposure is less than 10% of our portfolio and is focused in urban dense markets, and nearly two-thirds of our loans are multifamily, primarily in supply-constrained markets,” said Jeremy Barnum, chief financial officer, in the company’s post-earnings conference call. Investors and regulators are watching the $20 trillion US commercial real estate market for signs that it could be the next shoe to drop after the banking tumult last month. That’s partly because the value of buildings is going down, particularly as offices in major cities remain vacant or half-empty as Americans opt to work from home. The commercial real estate industry’s woes come after decades of unbridled growth powered by low interest rates and easy credit. That upward trend was interrupted by the Covid pandemic’s onset, and then when the Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates aggressively last year to stabilize the economy. “There are obviously some big things here and there to pay attention to, but in the scheme of things for us, not a big issue,” Barnum said. Spending at US retailers fell in March as consumers pulled back amid recessionary fears fueled by the banking crisis. Retail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation, fell by 1% in March from the prior month, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. That was steeper than an expected 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv, and above the revised 0.2% decline in the prior month. The drop was driven by a pullback in spending at department stores and on durable goods such as appliances and furniture. Spending at general merchandise stores fell 3% in March from the prior month and spending at gas stations declined 5.5% during the same period. Excluding gas station sales, retail spending retreated 0.6% in March from February. However, year-on-year retail spending rose 2.9%. Citigroup shares were up about 0.8% in premarket trading after the bank posted strong first-quarter profits, beating analyst expectations for both earnings per share and revenue. The bank brought in $21.4 billion in revenue versus expectations of $19.9 billion. Earnings per share were $2.19, estimates were for $1.67. Citi CEO Jane Fraser and CFO Mark Mason will hold an earnings presentation at 11 a.m. ET. Stocks slid Friday, even as big banks reported beats on their first-quarter earnings in an auspicious start to earnings season. Investors were watching for clues about the financial sector’s stability, and whether the tumult in the sector last month could lead to tighter lending standards. A key point of interest was also how much big banks benefitted from increased deposit inflows when nervous customers fled from regional banks after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. JPMorgan, the largest bank in the United States and an economic bellwether, posted record revenue. Wells Fargo, Citigroup and PNC Financial Services also reported earnings beats. Shares of JPMorgan Chase gained 4.8%, Wells Fargo rose 0.7%, Citigroup added 1.9% and PNC Financial Services ticked up 0.3%. Meanwhile, retail sales came in weaker than expected as recession fears loom. Retail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation, fell by 1% in March from the month before, according to the Commerce Department. Economists expected a 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv. The Dow fell 38 points, or about 0.1%. The S&P 500 sank 0.1%. The Nasdaq Composite declined 0.5%. The Federal Reserve could end its historic rate-hiking campaign after just one more quarter-point increase, said Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic in a Thursday interview with Reuters. The Fed has approved nine rate hikes in a row since last March, the effects of which are only now starting to “bite,” Bostic said. Monetary policy can take months to trickle through the economy, but a slew of recent data suggests that inflation is finally cooling. The March Consumer Price Index shows price hikes have slowed for nine months in a row, and headline wholesale inflation reflected in the Producer Price Index has sunk to 2.7% after reaching double digit highs last year. Bostic said the recent “chaos” in the banking sector, after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, persuaded him to rethink the pace of rate hikes. However, he told Reuters he believes the turmoil will not have any lasting impact on the the US economy. Analysts expect the Fed to raise rates by a quarter point at its upcoming policy meeting on May 2-3, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Regional bank PNC Financial reported first-quarter revenue of $5.6 billion and earnings per share of $3.98 vs. expectations of $3.66. Shares rose 5% on the news. Wells Fargo reported first-quarter revenue of $20.7 billion against expectations of $20.1 billion. The San Francisco-based bank saw earnings of $4.9 billion, up from $3.8 billion a year earlier, an increase of about 32%. Shares of Wells Fargo rose 2.2%. JPMorgan Chase on Friday reported first-quarter profit and revenue that roundly beat expectations, boosted by a year of rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. The New York-based bank posted a profit of $12.6 billion or $4.10 per share. That’s up from $8.3 billion, or $2.63 per share from the same period a year before. Analysts expected earnings of $3.41 per share, according to Refinitiv. With $3.67 trillion in assets, JPMorgan Chase is the largest bank in the United States and a bellwether for the US economy. “The US economy continues to be on generally healthy footings — consumers are still spending and have strong balance sheets, and businesses are in good shape. However, the storm clouds that we have been monitoring for the past year remain on the horizon,” CEO Jamie Dimon said in a press release. Net interest income rose to $20.8 billion, up 49% from the prior year, driven by the aggressive interest rate campaign the Fed kicked off last year to stabilize prices. Deposits rose to $2.38 trillion during the first quarter from $2.34 trillion in the quarter ended in December. That comes after the banking tumult last month triggered a rush into big banks from nervous customers. Investors also looked to money market funds as a haven. A key point of conversation after last month’s turmoil in the banking sector has been whether banks could tighten lending standards, leading customers to spend less as it becomes more difficult to borrow money for large purchases like homes and cars. “Financial conditions will likely tighten as lenders become more conservative, and we do not know if this will slow consumer spending,” Dimon said, adding that JPMorgan Chase is “confident that we can serve the needs of our customers and clients in all environments.” Shares of JPMorgan Chase climbed 6.1% in pre-market trading. The company’s post-earnings conference call is slated for 8:30 a.m. ET. Stocks: US stock futures fell ahead of several bank earnings this morning. Investors also fretted a retail sales report that is expected to show consumers are pulling back on their spending. Dow futures were down 75 points, or 0.2%. S&P 500 futures fell 0.2%. Nasdaq futures were 0.4% lower. European stocks were higher and Asian stocks closed up. Fear & Greed Index: 67 = Greed Oil & gas: US oil prices were up 0.3% to $82 a barrel. Average US gas prices rose to $3.66 a gallon. Wall Street is searching for answers to two key questions: Is the economy headed for a recession? And, if so, who’s poised to weather it? Recession fears have ramped up in recent weeks after the banking tumult last month raised concerns about the financial sector’s health. Earnings season for banks starts on Friday with JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, BlackRock, Citigroup and PNC Financial Services slated to report before the bell. Investors will be watching for clues about stability. Stocks have yet to price in the economy’s precarious position, with the S&P 500 adding about 7% this year. But markets have already seen volatile trading since then. “We’re going to see a correction happen here, because it just never makes sense when the market’s going up and earnings are going down,” says Eric Sterner, chief investment officer at Apollon Wealth Management. But while earnings are an undeniable factor driving markets, inflation remains a key concern. Wall Street remains overly optimistic that the Fed will cut rates later this year — even after officials indicated last month that they likely won’t — or that it could even orchestrate a soft landing. That hope, and the market’s resilience, could start to crumble in the next few weeks, said Megan Horneman, chief investment officer at Verdence Capital Advisors. “You very well could see that catalyst over the next couple of weeks with earnings, and then this inflation data and then what the Fed says when they meet,” said Horneman. Jeremy Grantham made his name predicting the dot-com crash in 2000 and the financial crisis in 2008. Now, the famous investor warns another epic bubble in financial markets is bursting — and the turmoil that swept through the banking sector last month is just the beginning. “Other things will break, and who knows what they will be,” Grantham told CNN in an exclusive interview. “We’re by no means finished with the stress to the financial system.” Since early 2022, when the S&P 500 hit an all-time high, US stocks have dropped about 15% as central banks have jacked up borrowing costs. But Grantham sees much steeper declines on the horizon. The “best we can hope for,” he said, is a fall of about 27% from current levels, while the worst-case scenario would see a plunge of more than 50%. The low point might not arrive until “deep into next year,” he added. Grantham sees uncomfortable parallels between markets today and 2000, when an explosion in the price of tech stocks was followed by a dizzying crash. There are also echoes of 2008, when a painful comedown in the US housing market almost broke the banking system. What’s even more worrying is that this time, bubbles in the stock market and the real estate market are poised to burst simultaneously, Grantham said. The broader US banking system remains sound and stable, but the two regional banks that failed were “poorly managed” and “took unacceptable risks,” White House economic adviser Lael Brainard told CNN’s Poppy Harlow in an interview Wednesday at Semafor’s World Economy Summit in Washington, DC. Last month’s collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank roiled markets and spread fear through the economy of a possible wider banking crisis. The US Treasury, Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation all intervened to ensure bank customers could access all their money and to attempt to stave off future bank runs. “The banking system, it’s very sound, it’s stable; the core of the banking system has a great deal of capital that was put in place in the wake of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis,” said Brainard, director of the White House National Economic Council. “There were some banks who were not managing their risks effectively. They failed, and the president took strong actions along with the Secretary of the Treasury and the banking regulators,” she said. “Those actions reassured Americans their deposits are safe, the banking system is sound; but it was also important to the president that the executives of those failed banks were held accountable and, very important, that taxpayer money not be at risk,” she continued. Before its collapse last month, Silicon Valley Bank was known to investors of color as a place that fostered a community of minority entrepreneurs and provided them with both social and financial capital. SVB regularly sponsored conferences and networking events for minority entrepreneurs, and it was well known for funding the annual State of Black Venture Report spearheaded by BLK VC, a nonprofit organization that connects and empowers Black investors. “When other banks were saying no, SVB would say yes,” said Joynicole Martinez, a 25-year entrepreneur and chief advancement and innovation officer for Rising Tide Capital, a nonprofit organization founded in 2004 to connect entrepreneurs with investors and mentors. Minority business owners have long faced challenges accessing capital due to discriminatory lending practices, experts say. Data from the Small Business Credit Survey, a collaboration of all 12 Federal Reserve banks, shows disparities on denial rates for bank and nonbank loans. In 2021, about 16% of Black-led companies acquired the total amount of business financing they sought from banks, compared to 35% of White-owned companies, the survey shows. “We know there’s historic, systemic, and just blatant racism that’s inherent in lending and banking. We have to start there and not tip-toe around it,” Martinez told CNN. The Financial Services Forum, an organization representing the eight largest financial institutions in the United States has said banks have committed millions of dollars since 2020 to address economic and racial inequality.

1,2024-08-01 14:31:43.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-01 11:52:44.000,Still haven't filed your taxes? Here's what you need to know,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/13/success/tax-filing-tips/index.html,2023-04-14 20:07:40.000,"Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks So far this tax season, the IRS has received more than 100 million income tax returns for 2022. That means tens of millions of households have yet to file their returns. If yours is among them, here are some last-minute tax-filing tips to keep in mind as the Tuesday, April 18 deadline approaches. Not everyone has to file on April 18: If you live in a federally declared disaster area, have a business there — or have relevant tax documents stored by businesses in that area — it’s likely the IRS has already extended the filing and payment deadlines for you. Here is where you can find the specific extension dates for each disaster area. Thanks to many rounds of extreme weather in recent months, for instance, tax filers in most of California — which accounts for 10% to 15% of all federal filers — have already been granted an extension until Oct. 16 to file and to pay, according to an IRS spokesperson. If you’re in the armed forces and are currently or were recently stationed in a combat zone, the filing and payment deadlines for your 2022 taxes are most likely extended by 180 days. But your specific extended filing and payment deadlines will depend on the day you leave (or left) the combat zone. This IRS publication offers more detail. Taxes and adulting: What to know about filing taxes on your own for the first time Lastly, if you made little to no money last year (typically less than $12,950 for single filers and $25,900 for married couples), you may not be required to file a return. But you may want to anyway if you think you are eligible for a refund thanks to, for instance, refundable tax credits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit. (Use this IRS tool to gauge whether you are required to file this year.) You also are likely eligible to use IRS Free File (intended for those with adjusted gross income of $73,000 or less) so it won’t cost you to submit a return. Your paycheck may not be your only source of income: If you had one full-time job you may think that is the only income you made and have to report. But that’s not necessarily so. Other potentially taxable and reportable income sources include: Organize your tax documents: By now you should have received every tax document that third parties are required to send you (your employer, bank, brokerage, etc.). If you don’t recall receiving a hard copy of a tax form in the mail, check your email and your online accounts — a document may have been sent to you electronically. Here are some of the tax forms you may have received: “Be aware that there’s no form for some taxable income, like proceeds from renting out your vacation property, meaning you’re responsible for reporting it on your own,” according to the Illinois CPA Society. One very last-minute way to reduce your 2022 tax bill: If you’re eligible to make a tax-deductible contribution to an IRA and haven’t done so for last year, you have until April 18 to contribute up to $6,000 ($7,000 if you’re 50 or older). That will reduce your tax bill and augment your retirement savings. Proofread your return before submitting it: Do this whether you’re using tax software or working with a professional tax preparer. Little mistakes and oversights delay the processing of your return (and the issuance of your refund if you’re owed one). You want to avoid things like having a typo in your name, birth date, Social Security number or direct deposit number; choosing the wrong filing status (e.g., married vs single); making a simple math error; or leaving a required field blank. What to do if you can’t file by April 18: If you’re not able to file by next Tuesday, fill out Form 4868 electronically or on paper and send it in by April 18. You will be granted an automatic six-month extension to file. Your tax refund may be smaller this year. Here's why Note, however, that an extension to file is not an extension to pay. You will be charged interest (currently running at 7%) and a penalty on any amount you still owe for 2022 but haven’t paid by April 18. So if you suspect you still owe tax — perhaps you had some income outside of your job for which tax wasn’t withheld or you had a big capital gain last year — approximate how much more you owe and send that money to the IRS by Tuesday. You can choose to do so by mail, attaching a check to your extension request form. Make sure your envelope is postmarked no later than April 18. Or the more efficient route is pay what you owe electronically at IRS.gov, said CPA Damien Martin, a tax partner at EY. If you do that, the IRS notes you will not have to file a Form 4868. “The IRS will automatically process an extension of time to file,” the agency notes in its instructions. If you opt to electronically pay directly from your bank account, which is free, select “extension” and then “tax year 2022” when given the option. You can also pay by credit or debit card, but you will be charged a processing fee. Doing so, though, may become much more costly than just a fee if you charge your tax payment but don’t pay your credit card bill off in full every month, since you likely pay a high interest rate on outstanding balances. If you still owe income taxes to your state, remember that you may need to go through a similar exercise of filing for an extension and making a payment to your state’s revenue department, Martin said. Use this interactive tax assistant for basic questions you may have: The IRS provides an “interactive tax assistant” that can help you answer more than 50 basic questions pertaining to your individual circumstance on income, deductions, credits and other technical questions.

1,2024-08-01 14:31:43.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-01 11:52:44.000,Retail spending fell in March as consumers pull back,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/14/economy/march-retail-sales/index.html,2023-04-14 14:29:52.000,"Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Spending at US retailers fell in March as consumers pulled back after the banking crisis fueled recession fears. Retail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation, fell by 1% in March from the prior month, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. That was steeper than an expected 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv, and above the revised 0.2% decline in the prior month. Investors chalk up some of the weakness to a lack of tax returns and concerns about a slowing labor market. The IRS issued $84 billion in tax refunds this March, about $25 billion less than they issued in March of 2022, according to BofA analysts. That led consumers to pull back in spending at department stores and on durable goods, such as appliances and furniture. Spending at general merchandise stores fell 3% in March from the prior month and spending at gas stations declined 5.5% during the same period. Excluding gas station sales, retail spending retreated 0.6% in March from February. However, retail spending rose 2.9% year-over-year. Smaller tax returns likely played a role in last month’s decline in retail sales, along with the expiration of enhanced food assistance benefits, economists say. “March is a really important month for refunds. Some folks might have been expecting something similar to last year,” Aditya Bhave, senior US economist at BofA Global Research, told CNN. Credit and debit card spending per household tracked by Bank of America researchers moderated in March to its slowest pace in more than two years, which was likely the result of smaller returns and expired benefits, coupled with slowing wage growth. Enhanced pandemic-era benefits provided through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program expired in February, which might have also held back spending in March, according to a Bank of America Institute report. Average hourly earnings grew 4.2% in March from a year earlier, down from the prior month’s annualized 4.6% increase and the smallest annual rise since June 2021, according to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Employment Cost Index, a more comprehensive measure of wages, has also shown that worker pay gains have moderated this past year. ECI data for the first quarter of this year will be released later this month. Still, the US labor market remains solid, even though it has lost momentum recently. That could hold up consumer spending in the coming months, said Michelle Meyer, North America chief economist at Mastercard Economics Institute. “The big picture is still favorable for the consumer when you think about their income growth, their balance sheet and the health of the labor market,” Meyer said. Employers added 236,000 jobs in March, a robust gain by historical standards but smaller than the average monthly pace of job growth in the prior six months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The latest monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, showed that the number of available jobs remained elevated in February — but was down more than 17% from its peak of 12 million in March 2022, and revised data showed that weekly claims for US unemployment benefits were higher than previously reported. The job market could cool further in the coming months. Economists at the Federal Reserve expect the US economy to head into a recession later in the year as the lagged effects of higher interest rates take a deeper hold. Fed economists had forecast subdued growth, with risks of a recession, prior to the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. For consumers, the effects of last month’s turbulence in the banking industry have been limited so far. Consumer sentiment tracked by the University of Michigan worsened slightly in March during the bank failures, but it had already shown signs of deteriorating before then. The latest consumer sentiment reading, released Friday morning, showed that sentiment held steady in April despite the banking crisis, but that higher gas prices helped push up year-ahead inflation expectations by a full percentage point, rising from 3.6% in March to 4.6% in April. “On net, consumers did not perceive material changes in the economic environment in April,” Joanne Hsu, director of the surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan, said in a news release. “Consumers are expecting a downturn, they’re not feeling as dismal as they were last summer, but they’re waiting for the other shoe to drop,” Hsu told Bloomberg TV in an interview Friday morning.

1,2024-08-01 14:31:43.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-01 11:52:44.000,Analysis: Fox News is about to enter the true No Spin Zone,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/14/media/fox-news-dominion-hnk-intl/index.html,2023-04-14 06:41:00.000,"Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks This is it. The media defamation trial of the century is on the precipice of kicking off in Wilmington, Delaware, in just days. Jury selection in Dominion Voting Systems’ monster $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit took place all of Thursday, with 300 potential jurors being summoned to court. Good progress was made and the presiding judge noted that there were “more than enough jurors” to start the trial as scheduled on Monday. It is there, in Courtroom 7E, where the biggest figures in Murdoch Media, accompanied by a throng of high-powered lawyers, will attempt to mount their defense after repeatedly failing to convince a judge to toss the now-historic case. A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. It’s, frankly, extraordinary to write those words. When I watched Fox News broadcast election lies in the aftermath of the 2020 election, never did I expect the network to be held accountable in a meaningful way. I’ve covered Fox News for a while now. I’ve watched thousands and thousands of hours of the right-wing channel’s programming. I’ve seen its hosts over the years undermine public health, make gross anti-immigrant remarks, peddle lies and propaganda and push deranged conspiracy theories that were once reserved for the right-wing’s furthest fringes. The network has always seemed to find a way to sail through the controversy, even the most hellish storms it has faced. Sometimes it has emerged even stronger and more emboldened than before. But this time is different. This time, the normal tricks the network turns to during times of crisis will not free it from trouble. This time, in a court of law, the network will need to put forward an honest, fact-driven argument. Fox News is about to enter the true No Spin Zone, where deception is strictly prohibited. Where it is not in charge. And where its top executives like Rupert Murdoch and Suzanne Scott and hosts like Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity cannot simply ignore a request for comment and resort to, instead, attacking “the media” on-air. In this setting, where lies cannot be casually told and truth cannot be distorted beyond reality to fit a dishonest narrative, it will be fascinating to see how the network fares. If the pre-trial hearings are any indicator, it won’t be pretty. The case hasn’t even started and the presiding judge has already lost his patience with Fox’s legal team and put them on notice. Perhaps the winds will shift for Fox News when the judge gavels in the trial on Monday. But if they play out like the last few weeks of court have, Fox News is in for a brutal ride.

1,2024-08-01 14:31:43.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-01 11:52:44.000,Silicon Valley Bank collapse renews calls to address disparities impacting entrepreneurs of color ,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/13/business/silicon-valley-bank-entrepreneurs-of-color-reaj/index.html,2023-04-13 21:13:04.000,"Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks When customers at Silicon Valley Bank rushed to withdraw billions of dollars last month, venture capitalist Arlan Hamilton stepped in to help some of the founders of color who panicked about losing access to payroll funds. As a Black woman with nearly 10 years of business experience, Hamilton knew the options for those startup founders were limited. SVB had a reputation for servicing people from underrepresented communities like hers. Its failure has reignited concerns from industry experts about lending discrimination in the banking industry and the resulting disparities in capital for people of color. Hamilton, the 43-year-old founder and managing partner of Backstage Capital, said that when it comes to entrepreneurs of color, “we’re already in the smaller house. We already have the rickety door and the thinner walls. And so, when a tornado comes by, we’re going to get hit harder.” Established in 1983, the midsize California tech lender was America’s 16th largest bank at the end of 2022 before it collapsed on March 10. SVB provided banking services to nearly half of all venture-backed technology and life-sciences companies in the United States. Hamilton, industry experts and other investors told CNN the bank was committed to fostering a community of minority entrepreneurs and provided them with both social and financial capital. SVB regularly sponsored conferences and networking events for minority entrepreneurs, said Hamilton, and it was well known for funding the annual State of Black Venture Report spearheaded by BLK VC, a nonprofit organization that connects and empowers Black investors. “When other banks were saying no, SVB would say yes,” said Joynicole Martinez, a 25-year entrepreneur and chief advancement and innovation officer for Rising Tide Capital, a nonprofit organization founded in 2004 to connect entrepreneurs with investors and mentors. Martinez is also an official member of the Forbes Coaches Council, an invitation-only organization for business and career coaches. She said SVB was an invaluable resource for entrepreneurs of color and offered their clients discounted tech tools and research funding. Minority business owners have long faced challenges accessing capital due to discriminatory lending practices, experts say. Data from the Small Business Credit Survey, a collaboration of all 12 Federal Reserve banks, shows disparities on denial rates for bank and nonbank loans. In 2021, about 16% of Black-led companies acquired the total amount of business financing they sought from banks, compared to 35% of White-owned companies, the survey shows. “We know there’s historic, systemic, and just blatant racism that’s inherent in lending and banking. We have to start there and not tip-toe around it,” Martinez told CNN. Asya Bradley is an immigrant founder of multiple tech companies like Kinley, a financial services business aiming to help Black Americans build generational wealth. Following SVB’s collapse, Bradley said she joined a WhatsApp group of more than 1,000 immigrant business founders. Members of the group quickly mobilized to support one another, she said. Immigrant founders often don’t have Social Security numbers nor permanent addresses in the United States, Bradley said, and it was crucial to brainstorm different ways to find funding in a system that doesn’t recognize them. “The community was really special because a lot of these folks then were sharing different things that they had done to achieve success in terms of getting accounts in different places. They also were able to share different regional banks that have stood up and been like, ‘Hey, if you have accounts at SVB, we can help you guys,’” Bradley said. Many women, people of color and immigrants opt for community or regional banks like SVB, Bradley says, because they are often rejected from the “top four banks” — JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citibank. In her case, Bradley said her gender might have been an issue when she could only open a business account at one of the “top four banks” when her brother co-signed for her. “The top four don’t want our business. The top four are rejecting us consistently. The top four do not give us the service that we deserve. And that’s why we’ve gone to community banks and regional banks such as SVB,” Bradley said. None of the top four banks provided a comment to CNN. The Financial Services Forum, an organization representing the eight largest financial institutions in the United States has said the banks have committed millions of dollars since 2020 to address economic and racial inequality. Last week, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told CNN’s Poppy Harlow that his bank has 30% of its branches in lower-income neighborhoods as part of a $30 billion commitment to Black and Brown communities across the country. Wells Fargo specifically pointed to its 2022 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion report, which discusses the bank’s recent initiatives to reach underserved communities. The bank partnered last year with the Black Economic Alliance to initiate the Black Entrepreneur Fund — a $50 million seed, startup, and early-stage capital fund for businesses founded or led by Black and African American entrepreneurs. And since May 2021, Wells Fargo has invested in 13 Minority Depository Institutions, fulfilling its $50 million pledge to support Black-owned banks. Black-owned banks work to close the lending gap and foster economic empowerment in these traditionally excluded communities, but their numbers have been dwindling over the years, and they have far fewer assets at their disposal than the top banks. OneUnited Bank, the largest Black-owned bank in the United States, manages a little over $650 million in assets. By comparison, JPMorgan Chase manages $3.7 trillion in assets. Because of these disparities, entrepreneurs also seek funding from venture capitalists. In the early 2010s, Hamilton intended to start her own tech company — but as she searched for investors, she saw that White men control nearly all venture capital dollars. That experience led her to establish Backstage Capital, a venture capital fund that invests in new companies led by underrepresented founders. “I said, ‘Well, instead of trying to raise money for one company, let me try to raise for a venture fund that will invest in underrepresented — and now we call them underestimated — founders who are women, people of color, and LGBTQ specifically,’ because I am all three,” Hamilton told CNN. Since then, Backstage Capital has amassed a portfolio of nearly 150 different companies and has made over 120 diversity investments, according to data from Crunchbase. But Bradley, who is also an ‘angel investor’ of minority-owned businesses, said she remains “really hopeful” that community banks, regional banks and fintechs “will all stand up and say, ‘Hey, we are not going to let the good work of SVB go to waste.’” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

In addition to water loss due to an intense multiyear drought, the US Geological Survey and the Bureau of Reclamation report found, Lake Powell faced an average annual loss in storage capacity of about 33,270 acre-feet, or 11 billion gallons, per year between 1963 and 2018. That’s enough water to fill the Reflecting Pool on the National Mall about 1,600 times. The capacity of the reservoir is shrinking because of sediments flowing in from the Colorado and San Juan rivers, according to the report. Those sediments settle at the bottom of the reservoir and decrease the total amount of water the reservoir can hold. As of Monday, Lake Powell was around 25% full, according to data from the Bureau of Reclamation. It’s bad news for a region already facing water shortages and extreme wildfires due to the drought. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration drought experts said last week these conditions are expected to at least continue – if not worsen – in the coming months. Lake Powell is an important reservoir in the Colorado River Basin. Both Lake Powell and nearby Lake Mead, the nation’s largest reservoir, have drained at an alarming rate. In August, the federal government declared a water shortage on the Colorado River for the first time after Lake Mead’s water level plunged to unprecedented lows, triggering mandatory water consumption cuts for states in the Southwest that began in January. And last week, Lake Powell dipped below the critical threshold of 3,525 feet above sea level, sparking additional concerns about water supply and hydropower generation millions of people in the West rely on for electricity. The significance of the dwindling water supply along the Colorado cannot be overstated. The system supplies water for more than 40 million people living across seven Western states and Mexico. Lakes Powell and Mead provide a critical supply of drinking water and irrigation for many across the region, including rural farms, ranches and native communities. “It is vitally important we have the best-available scientific information like this report to provide a clear understanding of water availability in Lake Powell as we plan for the future,” Tanya Trujillo, assistant secretary for water and science with the US Department of Interior, said in a statement. “The Colorado River system faces multiple challenges, including the effects of a 22-year-long drought and the increased impacts of climate change.” © 2024 Cable News Network.

The report by IQAir, a company that tracks global air quality, found that average annual air pollution in every country — and 97% of cities — exceeded the World Health Organization’s air quality guidelines, which were designed to help governments craft regulations to protect public health. Related article Not only is Lake Powell's water level plummeting because of drought, its total capacity is shrinking, too Only 222 cities of the 6,475 analyzed had average air quality that met WHO’s standard. Three territories were found to have met WHO guidelines: the French territory of New Caledonia and the United States territories of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. India, Pakistan and Bangladesh were among the countries with the worst air pollution, exceeding the guidelines by at least 10 times. The Scandinavian countries, Australia, Canada, Japan and United Kingdom ranked among the best countries for air quality, with average levels that exceeded the guidelines by 1 to 2 times. In the United States, IQAir found air pollution exceeded WHO guidelines by 2 to 3 times in 2021. “This report underscores the need for governments around the world to help reduce global air pollution,” Glory Dolphin Hammes, CEO of IQAir North America, told CNN. “(Fine particulate matter) kills far too many people every year and governments need to set more stringent air quality national standards and explore better foreign policies that promote better air quality.” Above: IQAir analyzed average annual air quality for more than 6,000 cities and categorized them from best air quality, in blue (Meets WHO PM2.5 guildline) to worst, in purple (Exceeds WHO PM2.5 guideline by over 10 times). An interactive map is available from IQAir. It’s the first major global air quality report based on WHO’s new annual air pollution guidelines, which were updated in September 2021. The new guidelines halved the acceptable concentration of fine particulate matter — or PM 2.5 — from 10 down to 5 micrograms per cubic meter. PM 2.5 is the tiniest pollutant yet also among the most dangerous. When inhaled, it travels deep into lung tissue where it can enter the bloodstream. It comes from sources like the burning of fossil fuels, dust storms and wildfires, and has been linked to a number of health threats including asthma, heart disease and other respiratory illnesses. Related article Allergy season will start much earlier than normal and be far more intense because of climate crisis, study suggests Millions of people die each year from air quality issues. In 2016, around 4.2 million premature deaths were associated with fine particulate matter, according to WHO. If the 2021 guidelines had been applied that year, WHO found there could have been nearly 3.3 million fewer pollution-related deaths. IQAir analyzed pollution-monitoring stations in 6,475 cities across 117 countries, regions and territories. In the US, air pollution spiked in 2021 compared to 2020. Out of the more than 2,400 US cities analyzed, Los Angeles air remained the most polluted, despite seeing a 6% decrease compared to 2020. Atlanta and Minneapolis saw significant increases in pollution, the report showed. “The (United States’) reliance on fossil fuels, increasing severity of wildfires as well as varying enforcement of the Clean Air Act from administration to administration have all added to U.S. air pollution,” the authors wrote. Researchers say the main sources of pollution in the US were fossil fuel-powered transportation, energy production and wildfires, which wreak havoc on the country’s most vulnerable and marginalized communities. “We are heavily dependent on fossil fuels, especially in terms of transportation,” said Hammes, who lives a few miles from Los Angeles. “We can act smartly on this with zero emissions, but we’re still not doing it. And this is having a devastating impact on the air pollution that we’re seeing in major cities.” Related article Big-box stores could help slash emissions and save millions by putting solar panels on roofs. Why aren't more of them doing it? Climate change-fueled wildfires played a significant role in reducing air quality in the US in 2021. The authors pointed to a number of fires that led to hazardous air pollution — including the Caldor and Dixie fires in California, as well as the Bootleg Fire in Oregon, which wafted smoke all the way to the East Coast in July. China — which is among the countries with the worst air pollution — showed improved air quality in 2021. More than half of the Chinese cities analyzed in the report saw lower levels of air pollution compared to the previous year. The capital city of Beijing continued a five-year trend of improved air quality, according to the report, due to a policy-driven drawdown of polluting industries in the city. The report also found that the Amazon Rainforest, which had acted as the world’s major defender against the climate crisis, emitted more carbon dioxide than it absorbed last year. Deforestation and wildfires have threatened the critical ecosystem, polluted the air and contributed to climate change. “This is all a part of the formula that will lead to or is leading to global warming.” Hammes said. The report also unveiled some inequalities: Monitoring stations remain scant in some developing countries in Africa, South America and the Middle East, resulting in a dearth of air quality data in those regions. “When you don’t have that data, you’re really in the dark,” Hammes said. Related article Could Russia's war kick-start a renewable-energy revolution? It depends where in the world you look Hammes noted the African country of Chad was included in the report for the first time, due to an improvement in its monitoring network. IQAir found the country’s air pollution was the second-highest in the world last year, behind Bangladesh. Tarik Benmarhnia, a climate change epidemiologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography who has studied the health impact of wildfire smoke, also noted that relying only on monitoring stations can lead to blind spots in these reports. “I think it is great that they relied on different networks and not only governmental sources,” Benmarhnia, who was not involved in this report, told CNN. “However, many regions do not have enough stations and alternative techniques exist.” The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded in its 2021 report that, in addition to slowing the speed of global warming, curbing the use of fossil fuels would have the added benefit of improving air quality and public health. Hammes said the IQAir report is even more reason for the world to wean off fossil fuel. “We’ve got the report, we can read it, we can internalize it and really devote ourselves to taking action,” she said. “There needs to be a major move towards renewable energy. We need to take drastic action in order to reverse the tide of global warming; otherwise, the impact and the train that we’re on (would be) irreversible.” © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

1,2024-08-01 14:31:43.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-01 11:52:44.000,Big-box stores could help slash emissions and save millions by putting solar panels on roofs. Why aren't more of them doing it?,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/20/us/solar-power-on-big-box-store-rooftops-climate/index.html,2022-03-20 07:01:50.000,"As the US attempts to wean itself off its heavy reliance on fossil fuels and shift to cleaner energy sources, many experts are eyeing a promising solution: your neighborhood big-box stores and shopping malls. The rooftops and parking lot space available at retail giants like Walmart, Target and Costco is massive. And these largely empty spaces are being touted as untapped potential for solar power that could help the US reduce its dependency on foreign energy, slash planet-warming emissions and save companies millions of dollars in the process. At the IKEA store in Baltimore, installing solar panels on the roof and over the store’s parking lot cut the amount of energy it needed to purchase by 84%, slashing its costs by 57% from September to December of 2020, according to the company. (The panels also provide some beneficial shade to keep customers’ cars cool on hot, sunny days.) Related article Could Russia's war kick-start a renewable-energy revolution? It depends where in the world you look As of February 2021, IKEA had 54 solar arrays installed across 90% of its US locations. Big-box stores and shopping centers have enough roof space to produce half of their annual electricity needs from solar, according to a report from nonprofit Environment America and research firm Frontier Group. Leveraging the full rooftop solar potential of these superstores would generate enough electricity to power nearly 8 million average homes, the report concluded, and would cut the same amount of planet-warming emissions as pulling 11.3 million gas-powered cars off the road. The average Walmart store, for example, has 180,000 square feet of rooftop, according to the report. That’s roughly the size of three football fields and enough space to support solar energy that could power the equivalent of 200 homes, the report said. “Every rooftop in America that isn’t producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them,” Johanna Neumann, senior director for Environment America’s campaign for 100% Renewable, told CNN. “Now is the time to lean into local renewable energy production, and there’s no better place than the roofs of America’s big-box superstores.” Advocates involved in clean energy worker-training programs tell CNN that a solar revolution in big-box retail would also be a significant windfall for local communities, spurring economic growth while tackling the climate crisis, which has inflicted disproportionate harm on marginalized communities. Yet only a fraction of big-box stores in the US have solar on their rooftops or solar canopies in parking lots, the report’s authors told CNN. Related article Why record-high gas prices won't be solved by drilling more oil in the US CNN reached out to five of the top US retailers — Walmart, Kroger, Home Depot, Costco and Target — to ask: Why not invest in more rooftop solar? Many renewable energy experts point to solar as a relatively simple solution to cut down on costs and help rein in fossil fuel emissions, but the companies point to several roadblocks — regulations, labor costs and structural integrity of the rooftops themselves — that are preventing more widespread adoption. The need for these kinds of clean energy initiatives is becoming “unquestionably urgent” as the climate crisis accelerates, said Edwin Cowen, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Cornell University. “We are behind the eight ball, to put it mildly,” Cowen told CNN. “I would have loved to see policy help incentivize rooftop solar 15 years ago instead of five years ago in the commercial space. There’s still a tremendous amount of work to do.” Neumann said Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, possesses by far the largest solar potential. Walmart has around 5,000 stores in the US and more than 783 million square feet of rooftop space — an area larger than Manhattan — and more than 8,974 gigawatt hours of annual rooftop solar potential, according to the report. It’s enough electricity to power more than 842,000 homes, the report said. “Every rooftop in America that isn’t producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them.” Johanna Neumann, Environment America Walmart spokesperson Mariel Messier told CNN the company is involved in renewable energy projects around the world, but many of them are not rooftop solar installations. The company has reported having completed on- and off-site wind and solar projects or had others under development with a capacity to produce more than 2.3 gigawatts of renewable energy. Neumann said Environment America has met with Walmart a few times, urging the retailer to commit to installing solar panels on roofs and in parking lots. The company has said it’s aiming to source 100% of its energy through renewable projects by 2035. “Of all the retailers in America, Walmart stands to make the biggest impact if they put rooftop solar on all of their stores,” Neumann told CNN. “And for us, this report just underscores just how much of an impact they could make if they make that decision.” According to Environment America, Walmart had installed almost 194 megawatts of solar capacity on its US facilities as of the end of the 2021 fiscal year and additional capacity in off-site solar farms. The company’s installations in California were expected to provide between 20% to 30% of each location’s electricity needs. Target ranked No. 1 for on-site solar capacity in 2019, according to industry trade group Solar Energy Industries Association’s most recent report. It currently has 542 locations with rooftop solar — around a quarter of the company’s stores — a Target spokesperson told CNN. Rooftop solar generates enough energy to meet 15% to 40% of Target properties’ energy needs, the spokesperson said. Richard Galanti, the chief financial officer at Costco, said the company has 121 stores with rooftop solar around the world, 95 of which are in the US. Walmart, Target and Costco did not share with CNN what their biggest barriers are to adding rooftop or parking lot solar panels to more stores.  “My suspicion is that they want an even stronger business case for deviating from business-as-usual,” Neumann said. “Historically, all those roofs have done is cover their stores, and rethinking how [they] use their buildings and thinking of them as energy generators, not just protection from rain, requires a small change in their business model.” Home Depot, which has around 2,300 stores, currently has 75 completed rooftop solar projects, 12 in construction and more than 30 planned for future development, said Craig D’Arcy, the company’s director of energy management. Solar power generates around half of these stores’ energy needs on average, he said. Aging rooftops at stores are a “huge impediment” to solar installation, D’Arcy added. If a roof needs to be replaced in the next 15 to 20 years or sooner, it doesn’t make financial sense for Home Depot to add solar systems today, he said. “We have a goal of implementing solar rooftop where the economics are attractive,” D’Arcy told CNN. CNN also reached out to Kroger, which owns about 2,800 stores across the US. Kristal Howard, a Kroger spokesperson, said the company currently has 15 properties — stores, distribution centers and manufacturing plants — with solar installations. One of the “multiple factors affecting the viability of a solar installation” was the stores’ ability to support a solar installation on the roofs, Howard said. Cowen, the engineering professor at Cornell, said solar is already attractive, but that labor costs, incentives and the different layers of regulation likely pose some financial challenges in solar installations. “For them, this means usually hiring a local site firm that can do that installation that also knows local policy,” Cowen said. “It’s just another layer of complexity that I think is beginning to make sense because the costs have come down enough, but it needs kind of reopening that door of getting into an existing building.” Related article 'Delay means death': We're running out of ways to adapt to the climate crisis, new report shows. Here are the key takeaways Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois, who co-chairs the power sector task force in the House, said the US has “failed to provide the incentives to people who have the expertise to go in and build these things.” The reason both retail companies and the power sector have not made much progress on solar is because “our system is so disjointed” and has a complex regulation structure, Casten said. “Why aren’t we doing something that makes economic sense? The answer is this horribly disjointed federal policy where we massively subsidize fossil energy extraction, and we penalize clean energy production,” Casten told CNN. “For a long, long time, if you wanted to build a solar panel on the rooftop of Walmart, your biggest enemy was going to be your local utility because they didn’t want to lose the load. “We could have done this decades ago,” Casten added. “And had we done it, we would not be in this dire position with the climate, but we’d also have a lot more money in our pocket.” For Charles Callaway, director of organizing at the nonprofit group WE ACT for Environmental Justice, strengthening the rooftop solar capacity in big box retail stores is a no-brainer, especially if companies allow the local community to reap benefits either through installation jobs or sharing the electricity produced later. Either way, it would put a massive dent in curbing the climate crisis and help usher in an equitable transition away from fossil fuels — and it’s doable, Callaway told CNN. The New York City resident led a worker training program that helped train more than 100 local community members, mostly people of color, to become solar installers. He also formed a solar workers cooperative to ensure many of the participants of the training program get jobs in a tough market. In the last two years, Callaway said his group has not only installed solar panels on roofs of affordable housing units, but also equipment capable of producing 2 megawatts of solar energy on shopping malls up in upstate New York. He emphasized that hiring locally would be most beneficial since local installers know the community and local regulations best. Related article Allergy season will start much earlier than normal and be far more intense because of climate crisis, study suggests “One of my huge concerns is social equity,” Cowen said. “Access to renewable energy is a fairly privileged position these days, and we’ve got to figure out ways to make that not true.” Jasmine Graham, WE ACT’s energy justice policy manager, said the potential of building rooftop solar on big box superstores is encouraging, only “if these projects use local labor, if they are paying prevailing wages, and if this solar is being used in a manner such as community solar, which would allow [utility] bill discounts for folks that live in the same utility zone.” Pressure is mounting for global leaders to act urgently on the climate crisis after a UN report in late February warned the window for action is rapidly closing. Neumann believes the US can meet its energy demand with renewables. All it takes, she said, is the political will to make that switch, and the inclusion of the local community so no one gets left behind in the transition. “The sooner we make that transition, the sooner we’ll have cleaner air, the sooner we’ll have a more protected environment and better health and the sooner we’ll have a more livable future for our kids,” Neumann said. “And even if that requires investment, it is an investment worth making.” CNN’s Judson Jones contributed to this report. © 2024 Cable News Network.

1,2024-08-01 14:31:43.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-01 11:52:44.000,Look of the Week: Blackpink headline Coachella in Korean hanboks,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/blackpink-coachella-2023-hanboks-lotw/index.html,2023-04-18 15:39:40.000,"Editor’s Note: Featuring the good, the bad and the ugly, ‘Look of the Week’ is a regular series dedicated to unpacking the most talked about outfit of the last seven days. Bringing the second day of this year’s Coachella to a close, K-Pop girl group Blackpink made history Saturday night when they became the first Asian act to ever headline the festival. To a crowd of, reportedly, over 125,000 people, Jennie, Jisoo, Lisa and Rosé used the ground-breaking moment to pay homage to Korean heritage by arriving onstage in hanboks: a traditional type of dress. While the garments were shrugged off a few seconds into their opening track, “Pink Venom,” revealing each member’s custom black and pink Dolce and Gabbana outfit, fans across the world had already received the message. Screenshots of the moment quickly spread among Blackpink superfans, otherwise known as Blinks. “The way they stepped onto the biggest western stage in hanboks … literally proved their place at the top of the industry,” tweeted one Blink. “Blackpink really are in a league of their own.” Another called the group “Korea’s cultural delegation” on Instagram, in reference to not only the hanboks but other visual cues incorporated into their show, such as one of the stage backdrops featuring an angular tiled roof reminiscent of traditional Korean architecture. Look of the Week: Are we about to see more men in tights? In recent years, Blackpink have enjoyed a meteoric rise to global fame. According to Guinness World Records, they are currently the most streamed female group on Spotify, and have the most-viewed music YouTube channel. Last year, they were the first female K-Pop group to reach number 1 in the UK and US album charts, and in 2020 their track “How You Like That” became the most viewed video on YouTube in 24 hours. (The group also wore modernized hanboks, designed by Kim Danha, in one of the music video’s scenes.) Their landmark set over the weekend was in fact a follow-up to another milestone: In 2019, they became the first female K-Pop group to ever play at Coachella or any other US festival. From the iconic Jean Paul Gaultier cone bra worn by Madonna for her 1990 Blond Ambition tour to Geri “Ginger Spice” Halliwell’s Union Jack mini dress, the right stage costume can live on forever in public memory. Particularly when worn at a career-defining moment. During another watershed Coachella performance — Beyonce’s 2018 headline set — the singer’s custom Balmain collegiate-style yellow hoodie was a joyful nod to Black culture, specifically historically Black colleagues and universities. The group’s four black hanboks were custom created by South Korean pattern design brand OUWR and traditional Korean dressmakers Kumdanje. Inspired by the Cheol-lik silhouette, each garment was hand-embroidered with metallic traditional Korean motifs, including dan-cheong patterns and peonies (a symbol of royalty in Korea). “It was our pleasure and such an honor to be able to show the beautiful values of Korea and Hanbok together,” the designers wrote in a combined Instagram post. “Blackpink showed the beauty of Korea and dazzled the world.” In Korea, hanboks are still worn for special occasions and often seen on TV dramas. Many designers in the country have also created contemporary takes that are incorporated into everyday wear. At Seoul Fashion Week, JULYCOLUMN’s Fall-Winter 2023 collection drew on the hanbok’s voluminous silhouette to create shirts and structured jackets. Last September, Korean label BlueTamburin brought the garment to a Western audience by exclusively using traditional hanbok fabric to create its Spring-Summer 2023 collection at Milan Fashion Week. Look of the Week: 'Barbie' stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling hit the road in bubblegum pink Whether you’re a devoted Blink or not, the looks marked a moment of Asian visibility, recognition of traditional craftsmanship and a powerful example of feeling seen through fashion — representing Korean culture and symbolically embracing both its past and future. At the end of their performance, and having addressed the audience between numbers in English throughout their two-hour-long performance, Blackpink finished their set in Korean: “Until now, it has been Jennie, Jisoo, Lisa, and Rosé Blackpink. Thank you.” Top image: Blackpink performing at the first weekend of Coachella 2023, shortly after removing their hanboks. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

1,2024-08-01 14:31:43.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-01 11:52:44.000,Scientists identify secret ingredient in Leonardo da Vinci paintings,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/old-masters-da-vinci-egg-yolk-painting-scn/index.html,2023-03-30 17:43:18.000,"Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. “Old Masters” such as Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli and Rembrandt may have used proteins, especially egg yolk, in their oil paintings, according to a new study. Trace quantities of protein residue have long been detected in classic oil paintings, though they were often ascribed to contamination. A new study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications found the inclusion was likely intentional — and sheds light on the technical knowledge of the Old Masters, the most skilled European painters of the 16th, 17th, or early 18th century, and the way they prepared their paints. Scientists confirm long held theory about what inspired Monet “There are very few written sources about this and no scientific work has been done before to investigate the subject in such depth,” said study author Ophélie Ranquet of the Institute of Mechanical Process Engineering and Mechanics at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany, in a phone interview. “Our results show that even with a very small amount of egg yolk, you can achieve an amazing change of properties in the oil paint, demonstrating how it might have been beneficial for the artists.” Simply adding some egg yolk to their works, it turns out, could have long-lasting effects that went beyond just aesthetics. Compared with the medium formulated by ancient Egyptians called tempera — which combines egg yolk with powdered pigments and water — oil paint creates more intense colors, allows for very smooth color transitions and dries far less quickly, so it can be used for several days after its preparation. However, oil paint, which uses linseed or safflower oil instead of water, also has drawbacks, including being more susceptible to color darkening and damage caused by exposure to light. Because making paint was an artisanal and experimental process, it is possible that the Old Masters might have added egg yolk, a familiar ingredient, to the newer type of paint, which first showed up in the seventh century in Central Asia before spreading to Northern Europe in the Middle Ages and Italy during the Renaissance. In the study, the researchers recreated the process of paint-making by using four ingredients — egg yolk, distilled water, linseed oil and pigment — to mix two historically popular and significant colors, lead white and ultramarine blue. “The addition of egg yolk is beneficial because it can tune the properties of these paints in a drastic way,” Ranquet said, “For example by showing aging differently: It takes a longer time for the paint to oxidize, because of the antioxidants contained in the yolk.” The chemical reactions between the oil, the pigment and the proteins in the yolk directly affect the paint’s behavior and viscosity. “For example, the lead white pigment is quite sensitive to humidity, but if you coat it with a protein layer, it makes it a lot more resistant to it, making the paint quite easy to apply,” Ranquet said. “On the other hand, if you wanted something stiffer without having to add a lot of pigment, with a bit of egg yolk you can create a high impasto paint,” she added, referring to a painting technique where the paint is laid out in a stroke thick enough that the brushstrokes are still visible. Using less pigment would have been desirable centuries ago, when certain pigments — such as lapis lazuli, which was used to make ultramarine blue — were more expensive than gold, according to Ranquet. A direct evidence of the effect of egg yolk in oil paint, or lack thereof, can be seen in Leonardo da Vinci’s “Madonna of the Carnation,” one of the paintings observed during the study. Currently on display at the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, Germany, the work shows evident wrinkling on the face of Mary and the child. “Oil paint starts to dry from the surface down, which is why it wrinkles,” Ranquet said. One reason for wrinkling may be an insufficient quantity of pigments in the paint, and the study has shown that this effect could be avoided with the addition of egg yolk: “That’s quite amazing because you have the same quantity of pigment in your paint, but the presence of the egg yolk changes everything.” Because wrinkling occurs within days, it’s likely that Leonardo and other Old Masters might have caught onto this particular effect, as well as additional beneficial properties of egg yolk in oil paint, including resistance to humidity. The “Madonna of Carnation” is one of Leonardo’s earliest paintings, created at a time when he might have been still trying to master the then newly popular medium of oil paint. Another painting observed during the study was “The Lamentation Over the Dead Christ,” by Botticelli, also on display at the Alte Pinakothek. The work is mostly made with tempera, but oil paint has been used for the background and some secondary elements. “We knew that some parts of the paintings show brushstrokes that are typical for what we call an oil painting, and yet we detected the presence of proteins,” Ranquet said. “Because it’s a very small quantity and they are difficult to detect, this might be dismissed as contamination: In workshops, artists used many different things, and maybe the eggs were just from the tempera.” However, because adding egg yolk had such desirable effects on oil paint, the presence of proteins in the work might be an indication of deliberate use instead, the study suggested. Ranquet hopes that these preliminary findings might attract more curiosity toward this understudied topic. DNA analysis of Beethoven's hair reveals health issues — and a family secret Maria Perla Colombini, a professor of analytical chemistry at the University of Pisa in Italy, who was not involved in the study, agreed. “This exciting paper provides a new scenario for the understanding of old painting techniques,” she said in an email. “The research group, reporting results from molecular level up to a macroscopic scale, contributes to a new knowledge in the use of egg yolk and oil binders. They are not more looking at simply identifying the materials used by Old Masters but explain how they could produce wonderful and glittering effects by employing and mixing the few available natural materials. They try to discover the secrets of old recipes of which little or nothing is written,” she added. “This new knowledge contributes not only to a better conservation and preservation of artworks but also to a better comprehension of art history.” Top image: The “Mona Lisa” by Leonardo Da Vinci © 2024 Cable News Network.

1,2024-08-01 14:31:43.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-01 11:52:44.000,How Playboy cut ties with Hugh Hefner to create a post-MeToo brand,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/playboy-the-conversation/index.html,2023-04-11 07:10:28.000,"Editor’s Note: The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation. Hugh Hefner launched Playboy Magazine 70 years ago this year. The first issue included a nude photograph of Marilyn Monroe, which he had purchased and published without her knowledge or consent. Hefner went on to build the Playboy brand off the backs of the countless women featured in its pages, whose beauty and performance of heightened feminine sexuality have entertained its readers for generations. Approaching its 70th anniversary in December, Playboy has radically shifted. With the magazine no longer in publication, the Playboy Mansion sold to a developer and London’s last remaining Playboy Club closing in 2021, what is the future for Playboy? The brand is changing to keep up with the post-#MeToo world. Hefner passed away one month before allegations against film producer Harvey Weinstein surfaced in 2017 giving momentum to the #MeToo movement (which saw survivors of sexual assault and harassment speak out against their abusers). READ MORE: Sex, love and companionship … with AI? Why human-machine relationships could go mainstream In recent years, many have re-evaluated Hefner’s legacy and relationships with women. The 2022 docuseries “The Secrets of Playboy” (which aired on Channel 4 in the UK) detailed sexual misconduct accusations against Hefner from several ex-girlfriends, including model Sondra Theodore and TV personality Holly Madison. Hefner and Playboy’s relationship with women has been complicated. Playboy was an early supporter of abortion rights, helped fund the first rape kit and was at times an early proponent of inclusivity (for example featuring transgender model, Caroline “Tula” Cossey, in its June 1981 issue). But most women featured in Playboy have fit within a narrow beauty standard — thin, white, able-bodied and blonde. Meanwhile Hefner’s personal relationship with his much younger girlfriends reportedly followed patterns of control and emotional abuse. Ex-girlfriend Holly Madison described Hefner as treating her “like a glorified pet” in her 2015 memoir, “Down the Rabbit Hole.” Hefner’s passing meant he evaded reckoning with the #MeToo movement. Playboy, however, responded, releasing a statement in which it affirmed support for the women featured in “The Secrets of Playboy” and called Hefner’s actions “abhorrent.” The statement declared that the brand was no longer affiliated with the Hefner family and would be focusing on aspects of the company’s legacy that align with values of sex positivity and free expression. READ MORE: The ‘milf’: a brief cultural history, from Mrs Robinson to Stifler’s mom Today, Playboy is a very different company from the one Hefner launched nearly 70 years ago. Roughly 80% of Playboy staff identify as women, according the company, and its motto has changed from “Entertainment for Men” to “Pleasure for All.” Shares in the company are publicly traded and 40% of its board and management are women. The company has also moved towards more creator-led content through its app, Playboy Centerfold. Similar to subscription content service OnlyFans, Playboy Centerfold allows subscribers to view content from and interact with its creators, which it call “bunnies.” On the app, creators — or bunnies — are able portray their own bodies however they wish, putting the power back in their hands. Perhaps Playboy’s future is no longer in serving the male gaze, but instead the very audience Hefner dismissed in his first letter from the editor: “If you’re a man between the ages of 18 and 80 Playboy is meant for you … If you’re somebody’s sister, wife or mother-in-law and picked us up by mistake, please pass us along to the man in your life and get back to your Ladies Home Companion.” The stars of Playboy’s mid-2000s reality series, Holly Madison and Bridget Marquardt, are also enjoying a resurgence among fans. “The Girls Next Door” launched in 2004. The show focused on the lives of Hefner’s three girlfriends, Madison, Marquardt and Kendra Wilkinson. It became E’s best performing show and cultivated a new female audience for Playboy. “The Girls Next Door” was a story of complicated empowerment despite patriarchal interference. Its three female protagonists went from being known solely as some of Hefner’s many blonde girlfriends, to celebrities in their own right. They each ultimately broke up with Hefner, leaving the Mansion and going on to lead successful careers. The show’s depiction of Madison, Marquardt and Wilkinson as empowered, fun-loving and complex individuals, who found joy and agency through expressing their sexuality was perhaps what drew so many female fans to the show. However, amid the girls’ fight for agency, Hefner retaliated. The series shows that he maintained final say in every Playboy photograph of the girls, as well as imposing strict curfews and spending allowances. In Madison and Wilkinson’s memoirs, “Down the Rabbit Hole,” and “Sliding into Home,” they claim that production consistently undermined them. They refused to pay them for the first season, didn’t credit them until season four and aired their uncensored nude bodies in foreign broadcasts and DVD releases without consent. READ MORE: #MeToo in space: We must address the potential for sexual harassment and assault away from Earth Fan interest in “The Girls Next Door” remains strong. In August 2022 Madison and Marquardt launched their podcast “Girls Next Level,” where they interview previous playmates and interact with fans. They also recap episodes from their own points of view, unpacking their experiences of working on the show. Having reached 10 million downloads as of February 2023, the success of the podcast — 14 years after the last episode of “The Girls Next Door” — speaks to the cultural legacy of the Playboy brand. It also shows that despite Hefner’s original editor’s note, Playboy resonates with some women. Playboy is now in a post-Hefner era, where the imagery of women found within old issues of Playboy can serve as inspiration for others to enjoy their own sexuality. Whatever the future has for the company, the concept of Playboy has become public property — be that in the appearance of Playboy bunny costumes each Halloween, the popularity of cheeky Playboy logo tattoos or branded lingerie and clothing. In a post-#MeToo era, the women of Playboy are speaking up and taking over. With the mansion gates closed, the bunnies are finally reclaiming the brand as their own.

1,2024-08-01 14:31:43.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-01 11:52:44.000,'A definitive backslide.' Inside fashion's worrying runway trend,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/fashion-week-fall-winter-2023-size-diversity-skinny-wegovy/index.html,2023-04-06 20:53:38.000,"Now that the Fall-Winter 2023 catwalks have been disassembled, it’s clear one trend was more pervasive than any collective penchant for ruffles, pleated skirts or tailored coats. Across runways in New York, London, Milan and Paris, there was a notable scarcity of plus-size models. This comes at a time when there are five injectable medications which can be used as appetite suppressants currently available by prescription in the US, stirring much conversation; a sixth medication, Rybelsus, is taken as an oral pill. Two are officially approved in the UK — the largest influx of weight loss medication seen in the country in almost a decade. Dior's landmark Mumbai show signals India's growing luxury status In recent months, injectables such as Wegovy and Ozempic — which share the same active ingredient, semaglutide — have been widely reported as Hollywood’s worst-kept weight loss secret. (Ozempic is intended for use primarily to treat Type 2 diabetes.) Comedian Chelsea Handler claimed her “anti-aging doctor just hands (Ozempic) out to anybody” while appearing on a podcast in January. Even Elon Musk tweeted last year about being on Wegovy. For many fashion commentators and diversity advocates, the Fall-Winter 2023 runways were in sharp contrast to the (albeit limited) progress and heady promise of recent seasons. This rollback has been widely criticized in the style media as such. And its potential impact is being assessed more broadly: With the rise of these weight loss panaceas, the pursuit of size zero is now just a prescription away. In 2020, Jill Kortleve and Paloma Elsesser became the first models outside of a sample size to walk for the Italian fashion house Fendi. (Traditionally, a sample size falls between a US 0-4.) British label Erdem entered the plus-size market in 2021, extending its offering to a UK size 22 (or US size 18). And in January 2022, Valentino made headlines after its haute couture show featured a broad spectrum of body types. But this season, there was a visible lack of curve bodies on their runways — or many others. Fendi and Valentino did not respond when contacted by CNN, while Erdem declined to comment. According to fashion search engine Tagwalk, the number of mid and plus-size models dropped by 24% in comparison to Spring-Summer 2023. Similarly, a size inclusivity report conducted by Vogue Business found that 95.6% of all looks presented for Fall-Winter 2023 were in a size US 0-4. For context, industry market firm Plunkett Research estimated in 2015 that 68% of American women wear a size US 14 or above. “It was a definitive backslide,” said IMG model agent Mina White, who represents plus-size and curve supermodels including Elsesser and Ashley Graham. “It was frustrating to see some of these designers not using curved bodies where they had in the past.” Fendi and Valentino did not respond when contacted by CNN, while Erdem declined to comment. “Watching somebody like Ashley Graham attend the front row for so many of these major houses in full looks (provided by the designer), it was frustrating,” White continued. “They wanted to utilize her image and her social following to command a certain space in the market, but they didn’t want to be reflective on their runways.” For others, even the term “backslide” was too generous. “Slipping back from… what? A glorious time when the average American woman (size 16) was as present on the runways as she is in everyday life? A time when fashion ads cast as many ‘plus-size’ and ‘mid-size’ women as ‘straight-size’ women?” fashion journalist Amy Odell wrote in her Substack newsletter of this past season’s runways. “No one needed any data to understand that representing a wide array of body shapes and sizes in runway shows or in fashion imagery is not a priority for the industry.” That said, a handful of — mostly smaller — brands pushed ahead this season. In London, emerging labels Di Petsa, Karoline Vitto and Sinead O’Dwyer showcased lineups of size-diverse models. Inclusivity at Christian Siriano, Coach, Kim Shui, Collina Strada and Bach Mai stood out in New York; while in Paris, Belgian brand Esther Manas — a consistent flag-bearer for size diversity — staged one of the city’s most refreshing runways with an assortment of fun, sensual, feminine looks that complimented a range of bodies. There was also a smattering of mid- and plus-size castings to be seen elsewhere: Off-White and Michael Kors, for example, featured a few such models. At Harris Reed’s debut for Nina Ricci, Precious Lee opened the show — which also featured three more plus- and mid-size models. Fashion samples and sample size pieces are one-off garments made before an item is mass-produced, typically to be worn during runway shows. Prioritizing the same body type in sample sizes means runway models are more easily interchangeable, saving fashion houses time and money if someone were to drop out or get sick during or after the casting process for a show. It’s also partly why, according to White, casting curve models is still an uphill battle. She says she introduces brands to new faces months in advance of runway season, with their specific measurements up-top and easy to read in all correspondence. “I want to be ahead of that,” White said. “So I’m never told ‘Oh, we wanted to make it work, but we didn’t have her size’ or whatever that conversation might look like.” Look of the Week: What Pope Francis' AI puffer coat says about the future of fashion But despite her efforts, she says she’s frequently told it’s too much of a “financial lift” to make larger samples — even by legacy brands. “I get very upset when brands say that,” White said. “I don’t believe that it is, I believe that it’s people not being properly educated on how to do this right.” Beyond the lack of representation, White notes it’s painful for plus-size consumers to watch brands leverage resources to create custom, made-to-fit pieces for celebrities — all the while claiming the pot is empty for more inclusive runway samples. London-based stylist and editor Francesca Burns agrees sample sizes are part of the problem. In 2020, Burns went viral after she posted on Instagram about a fashion job gone wrong. She says she was sent five looks to style from Celine, none of which fit the size UK 8 (US 4) model booked for the shoot— an 18-year-old on her first job in the business. The experience left her “horrified,” Burns told CNN, recalling what she saw as the model’s shame and embarrassment. “Looking into this girl’s eyes,” Burns said, “she shouldn’t have felt like that.” Burns’ post, which called the current system “unacceptable,” was picked up widely in the fashion media. (When reached by CNN, Celine declined to comment on the incident.) “Ultimately, the desire to see change has to be there,” Burns said. “And I wonder whether luxury has that desire?” Progress has been slow, but not entirely inexistent. Across fashion campaigns, magazine covers and editorial shoots, there is a growing enthusiasm for inclusivity. “I see the options rolling in for the plus-sized talent, and they’re great offerings,” said White. “Great, strong editorials and covers and campaigns. But I do feel like without the clothes, we are going to go back to see more naked curve stories, or lingerie curve stories or a curve girl in a trench coat. That’s what I don’t want.” For British Vogue’s April issue, unveiled March 16, Elsesser, Lee and Jill Kortleve were dubbed “The New Supers.” Preceding the cover story is a letter written by editor-in-chief, Edward Enninful commending the models for “leading the way” and holding “powerful space” in the industry. “Catwalks are once again under scrutiny for a stark lack of body diversity,” read the magazine’s Instagram caption, unveiling the cover. “But this cover was not conceived as a statement. It is a crowning of an all-powerful trio, the supermodels for a new generation.” But many online were quick to point out the disconnect: Two of the Saint Laurent Spring-Summer 2023 dresses were modeled by plus-size women, though they are not available to buy in most plus sizes. In his own social media post, Enninful wrote about his disappointment at the Fall-Winter 2023 runways. “I thought I had gotten into a time machine. Show after show dominated by one body type, so many limited visions of womanhood… one prescribed notion of beauty prevailed again, and it felt like the reality of so many women around the world were being ignored.” But for White, the power rests within the entire industry — not just at the feet of brands. “I really do believe there should be an industry standard between the (Council of Fashion Designers of America), the British Fashion Council and key editors at some of these major mass market magazines,” she continued. “If there was a call-to-action from these figureheads saying, moving forward samples need to be readily available for a few different body types, we would see significant and impactful change.” Burns agrees there must be a trickle-down effect. “I think a lot of responsibility is put on young designers to solve all these issues around sustainability or issues around body inclusivity,” she said. “It’s important that the big powerhouses, which have the capacity to action change, really take some responsibility.” On March 8, Wegovy — developed primarily as a treatment for those living with obesity and weight-related conditions — was approved in the UK. It’s the second injectable weight management medication to be made available with a prescription via the country’s National Health Service (NHS) in about 3 years, after almost a decade of quiet. Before 2020, the last weight loss medication was approved in the UK was in 2010. Similarly, the US has now approved three weight management injections: Wegovy, Saxenda and IMCIVREE. Medications for type-2 diabetes like Mounjaro and Ozempic are not FDA-approved for weight loss, though some doctors are issuing them at their own discretion. While these medicines are a revolutionary tool for those who struggle to lose weight for genetic or medical reasons, they are at risk of being abused. Semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic, was originally developed for treating type-2 diabetes. It quells hunger signals to the brain by mimicking the hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). “It can slow how quickly your stomach empties out and may give you a little more feeling of feeling full,” said Dr. Robert Lash, an endocrinologist and Chief Medical Officer of the Endocrine Society in Washington, D.C. In clinical trials, over a period of 68 weeks, participants who used the medication in conjunction with eating fewer calories and increasing their physical activity on average lost around 15% of their body weight compared to 2.4% of those using a placebo, according to the manufacturer Novo Nordisk. On March 13, the European Medicines Agency issued a statement warning of an Ozempic shortage that could continue through the year, urging doctors to prioritize prescriptions to diabetics. “Any other use, including for weight management, represents off-label use and currently places the availability of Ozempic for the indicated population at risk,” read the release. Patients typically need a BMI of 27 or higher (along with another weight-related condition like high blood pressure or diabetes) or have a genetic predisposition towards obesity to be prescribed such appetite suppressant medication by their doctor. But talk of these injectables has been sweeping the West. In January, the New York Times reported on the term “Ozempic Face,” coined by a New York-based dermatologist who reported treating several patients with a hollowed-out appearance that can come with rapid weight loss. By the end of February, the medication had made it to the cover of New York Magazine in a feature titled “Life After Food?” Adverts for GLP-1 injections are even blanketing New York City subway stations. And across social media, online forums and private group chats, some people looking to lose weight for primarily aesthetic purposes are searching for a way to skirt the requirements. “I was just looking for a way to lose a few pounds, like 10 to 15 at most,” said one 30-year-old American woman, who wished to remain anonymous, in a phone interview. She scoured social media and forums for guidance on securing a weight loss drug. “I’m certainly a normal BMI, I just have a trip to Mexico coming up and I want to look really good,” she said. Although she says she found a way to access Wegovy, she decided against the medication after considering the cost (which can reach more than $1,000 a month without insurance). “I’ve always very much fit the societal standard but lately I was just like f*ck it, I want to be skinny,” she told CNN. Dr. Lash emphasized the importance of taking weight loss drugs only with medical supervision and a valid prescription. “If somebody was a normal weight and they took this drug because they thought they could be even thinner than they are now, that could lead to complications,” he told CNN, warning of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and even gallbladder problems. “These drugs are not benign, they do have side effects involving the GI tract. There’s no such thing as a free lunch.” Fashion has long promoted size 0 as the ultimate virtue — regardless of its viability for many people, or any health risks. And now with the accessibility of accelerated weight loss medication, the stakes are even higher. For Burns and White, the industry is responsible for amplifying a new, more inclusive vision of beauty. “There’s a very archaic way of looking at women over a size 16 and just assuming that they’re unhealthy or uneducated or unstylish. Or don’t have the resources to buy into luxury,” said White. “The reality is the same women these brands are alienating in their fashion space are the same women running out to buy their handbags, shoes, perfumes, cosmetics and skincare.” Not only do designers need to create clothes with this consumer in mind, according to White, but they need to be seen on the runway, too. “It shouldn’t be a conversation. It should just be normalized that we’re not just looking at a single view of beauty,” echoed Burns. Ester Manas and Balthazar Delepierre, whose bridal-inspired Fall-Winter 2023 collection was one of this season’s most size-diverse runways, summarized it best in their accompanying show notes: “The body is not the subject. Because, obviously, at a wedding, everybody is invited. And all to the party. That is where the designer duo Ester and Balthazar take their stand.” © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

In 1998, Michael Jordan laced up a pair of his iconic black and red Air Jordan 13s to bring home a Bulls victory during Game 2 of his final NBA championship — and now they are the most expensive sneakers ever to sell at auction.The game-winning sneakers sold for $2.2 million at Sotheby’s in New York on Tuesday, smashing the sneaker auction record of $1.47 million, set in 2021 by a pair of Nike Air Ships that Jordan wore earlier in his career. Remember when Dennis Rodman put on a wedding dress and claimed to marry himself? The sale arrives during “Jordan Year” — a reference to the NBA star player’s iconic jersey number 23. In January, Air Jordan partnered with Sotheby’s to auction off 13 pairs of retro sneakers that were designed in memory of The Notorious B.I.G. All lots outsold their high estimates of $5,000 by multiples, with the highest selling for more than $32,000. Last year, Jordan’s Game 1 jersey, also from the 1998 finals, became the most expensive item of worn sports memorabilia to sell at auction when it fetched $10.1 million at a Sotheby’s sale. Jordan’s farewell run with the Chicago Bulls is often referred to as “The Last Dance,” after the title of an ESPN and Netflix documentary that chronicled the season. Jordan announced his (second) retirement weeks before the finals, leading to the six-game series against the Utah Jazz becoming the most-watched in NBA history, based on Nielsen TV ratings. (Jordan would later return from 2001 to 2003 to play with the Washington Wizards, but did not win another championship). “Michael Jordan game-worn sports memorabilia has proven time and time again to be the most elite and coveted items on the market,” said Brahm Wachter, Sotheby’s head of streetwear and modern collectables, in a press release prior to the sale. “However, items from his ‘Last Dance’ season are of a greater scale and magnitude as seen with our record-breaking sale of his Game 1 jersey in 2022.” The pair of sneakers sold Tuesday were worn during Game 2, in Salt Lake City, which the Bulls won 93-88 after losing Game 1, with Jordan scoring 37 points. They are the last pair of black and red Air Jordan 13s that Jordan ever wore on the court for an NBA game, a press release from Sotheby’s noted. 13 of the best menswear looks from Oscars history Following Game 2, Jordan signed and gifted the set of worn shoes to the ball boy in the visitor’s locker room, as he was known to do, according to Sotheby’s. The Air Jordan 13 sneakers starred in a sports memorabilia sale called “Victoriam,” which featured items worn by athletes including Tom Brady, Kobe Bryant and Roger Federer. Several other Jordan items were included in the two-part auction, with a game-worn 1998 Bulls jersey and a pair of 1985 Air Jordan 1s fetching $508,000 and $127,000 respectively. Other top lots included one of Kobe Bryant’s LA Lakers shooting shirts, which sold for over $406,000, and a soccer jersey, worn by the late Pelé on his debut for the New York Cosmos in 1975, that sold fetched over $177,000.

1,2024-08-01 14:31:43.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-01 11:52:44.000,The surreal facades of America's strip clubs,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/francois-prost-gentlemens-club/index.html,2023-03-06 14:13:40.000,"Some people travel the world in search of adventure, while others seek out natural wonders, cultural landmarks or culinary experiences. But French photographer François Prost was looking for something altogether different during his recent road trip across America: strip clubs. From Miami to Los Angeles, Prost’s latest book “Gentlemen’s Club” charts his route across the US via nearly 150 strip clubs with names like Pleasures, Temptations and Cookies N’ Cream. There isn’t a single nude woman to be seen, however, as Prost’s camera was exclusively trained on the buildings themselves — and specifically their often-colorful facades. Over the course of five weeks in 2019 he traversed over 6,000 miles, with the resulting photos capturing everything from the pastel hues of Florida’s Club Pink Pussycat to venues hiding in plain sight in the country’s more religious states. “I’d divide these venues into two types: One is very integrated into the public landscape, and one is a bit more hidden and dodgy,” Prost said, speaking to CNN on a video call and email. The first type, he added, could be found in “very American” settings, such as “around amusement parks and fast food and malls.” The latter venues, however, would sometimes look indistinguishable from any store in a strip mall. Prost said he found many such establishments along the Bible Belt, a socially conservative region in the country’s south. He was especially keen to explore the area due to the apparent contrast between the prevalence of strip clubs and what he describes in his book as “conservatism and extreme puritanism.” Prost insisted that he had little interest in the interiors or services of the strip clubs, which he always visited during the day. Instead, he hoped to learn more about American culture by creating objective, documentary-style photographs of establishments sitting at the intersection of sex, gender and commerce. Documenting changing attitudes toward sex through the lens of architecture, he added that the series was primarily of a landscape photography project. Artful photos inside Houston's ONYX strip club tell a story of beauty and confidence “The prism of this theme of strip club facades became a way of studying and trying to understand the country,” he wrote in “Gentlemen’s Club,” photographs from which will feature in an exhibition in Tokyo in March. ”(‘Gentlemen’s Club’ is) an objective panorama of dominant opinions and gender and the sexualization of the feminine image.” The genesis of Prost’s project dates back to his 2018 series, “After Party,” which focused on the flamboyant facades of French nightclubs. He said that people frequently commented that the buildings’ exteriors looked as though they had been ripped straight out of American cities, sparking the idea that he should visit the US and extend the project. As he meticulously planned his trip, he was struck not only by the sheer volume of strip clubs in America but that — unlike In Europe — they often demanded to be seen. Hot pink walls, gigantic nude silhouettes and even candy-cane-striped storefronts made no secret of the kind of entertainment provided inside. From Brutalist Boston to Modernist Palm Springs, America's most eye-catching city halls “A good example would be Las Vegas, where strip clubs are everywhere and their signs blink as much as a fast food (restaurant) or casino sign,” Prost said. Miami’s clubs were often painted in vivid, Wes Anderson-esque hues. Other photos show brightly covered venues contrasting with their sparse desert surroundings. If the establishments were open during the day, Prost would enter and ask for permission to take photos in order “to not look suspicious… and explain what my intentions were,” he said. The interiors rarely lived up to the tantalizing promises plastered across the signs outside, but the photographer met a host of characters during his five-week trip, from indifferent bouncers to managers who were thrilled about the project. “Most of the time, people were OK — 99% of them would say yes to a facade picture,” he said, adding they typically wouldn’t mind his presence, as long as he didn’t take photos of patrons or dancers. “Some would think that it was a bit strange, some would be really excited about it and give me their business card to send me the picture when it was done,” he said. Prost said his biggest surprise, however, was how “normalized” strip clubs appeared to be in everyday life. As he reflects in his book, “The relationship that Americans seem to have with strip clubs is quite different to what you see in Europe. Going to a strip club seems to be a lot more normalized … You go as a couple, or amongst friends at night to have fun.” Giant doughnuts and a shoe you can walk into: California's strangest buildings He was struck, for instance, by the fact that so many Las Vegas strip clubs doubled as restaurants — with many boasting happy hour deals, buffets and special discounts for truck drivers or construction workers. “I noticed a few strip clubs that would advertise being a strip club and steakhouse, so you could eat a big piece of meat (while) watching strippers. That is also something that seems very American to me,” he said, adding: “I heard from some people I met in Portland there are even strip clubs (that offer) vegan food.” The facades are littered with jokes like “My sex life is like the Sahara, 2 palms, no dates” and pun-based names like Booby Trap and Bottoms Up. Prost’s documentarian approach heightens the signs’ surreal comedy. But it also doubles as a neutral lens through which viewers can make up their own minds about the objectification of women. By honing in on the faceless dancing bodies of female silhouettes and the quintessential “girls girls girls” signs, “Gentleman’s Club” explores the commodification of women who are, in reality, completely absent in Prost’s works (an observation reflected in the book’s title, which is a phrase that crops up numerous times on signs throughout his photographs). The strip clubs he visited market women as things to be consumed, from the many food-themed names to an advertisement reading, “1,000’s of beautiful girls & three ugly ones.” For his next project, Prost plans to visit Japan to document the nation’s love hotels, which occupy a similar role as strip clubs in some parts of the US: open secrets in a conservative society. But the photographer believes the American establishments he visited say something unique about the country — something that is less about sexuality and more about the American dream. Museum of Sex to open new outpost in Miami What his project has shown him is, he said, this: “As long as you’re successful in terms of business, (it doesn’t matter) if your activity deals with sex.” “Gentlemen’s Club” will be exhibited at Agnes b. Galerie Boutique in Tokyo, Japan, between March 17 and April 15, 2023. The book, published by Fisheye Editions, is available now. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

1,2024-08-01 14:31:43.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-01 11:52:44.000,Here's the real reason to turn on airplane mode when you fly,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/airplane-mode-reasons-why/index.html,2023-04-07 12:52:23.000,"Editor’s Note: The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation. We all know the routine by heart: “Please ensure your seats are in the upright position, tray tables stowed, window shades are up, laptops are stored in the overhead bins and electronic devices are set to flight mode.” Now, the first four are reasonable, right? Window shades need to be up so we can see if there’s an emergency, such as fire. Tray tables need to be stowed and seats upright so we can get out of the row quickly. Laptops can become projectiles in an emergency, as the seat back pockets are not strong enough to contain them. And mobile phones need to be set to flight mode so they can’t cause an emergency for the airplane, right? Well, it depends whom you ask. Aviation navigation and communication relies on radio services, which has been coordinated to minimize interference since the 1920s. The digital technology currently in use is much more advanced than some of the older analog technologies we used even 60 years ago. Research has shown personal electronic devices can emit a signal within the same frequency band as the aircraft’s communications and navigation systems, creating what is known as electromagnetic interference. Half of the world's 10 busiest airports for 2022 are in one country But in 1992, the US Federal Aviation Authority and Boeing, in an independent study, investigated the use of electronic devices on aircraft interference and found no issues with computers or other personal electronic devices during non-critical phases of flight. (Takeoffs and landings are considered the critical phases.) The US Federal Communications Commission also began to create reserved frequency bandwidths for different uses – such as mobile phones and aircraft navigation and communications – so they do not interfere with one another. Governments around the globe developed the same strategies and policies to prevent interference problems with aviation. In the EU, electronic devices have been allowed to stay on since 2014. What's the safest seat on a plane? We asked an aviation expert Why then, with these global standards in place, has the aviation industry continued to ban the use of mobile phones? One of the problems lies with something you may not expect – ground interference. Wireless networks are connected by a series of towers; the networks could become overloaded if passengers flying over these ground networks are all using their phones. The number of passengers that flew in 2021 was over 2.2 billion, and that’s half of what the 2019 passenger numbers were. The wireless companies might have a point here. Of course, when it comes to mobile networks, the biggest change in recent years is the move to a new standard. Current 5G wireless networks – desirable for their higher speed data transfer – have caused concern for many within the aviation industry. Radio frequency bandwidth is limited, yet we are still trying to add more new devices to it. The aviation industry points out that the 5G wireless network bandwidth spectrum is remarkably close to the reserved aviation bandwidth spectrum, which may cause interference with navigation systems near airports that assist with landing the aircraft. Airport operators in Australia and the US have voiced aviation safety concerns linked to 5G rollout, however it appears to have rolled out without such problems in the European Union. Either way, it is prudent to limit mobile phone use on planes while issues around 5G are sorted out. Most airlines now provide customers with Wi-Fi services that are either pay-as-you-go or free. With new Wi-Fi technologies, passengers could theoretically use their mobile phones to make video calls with friends or clients in-flight. On a recent flight, I spoke with a cabin attendant and asked her opinion on phone use during flights. It would be an inconvenience for cabin crew to wait for passengers to finish their call to ask them if they would like any drinks or something to eat, she stated. On an airliner with 200+ passengers, in-flight service would take longer to complete if everyone was making phone calls. For me, the problem with in-flight use of phones is more about the social experience of having 200+ people on a plane, and all potentially talking at once. In a time when disruptive passenger behaviour, including “air rage”, is increasingly frequent, phone use in flight might be another trigger that changes the whole flight experience. Disruptive behaviours take on various forms, from noncompliance to safety requirements such as not wearing seat belts, verbal altercations with fellow passengers and cabin crew, to physical altercations with passengers and cabin crews – typically identified as air rage. In conclusion – in-flight use of phones does not currently impair the aircraft’s ability to operate. But cabin crews may prefer not to be delayed in providing in-flight service to all of the passengers – it’s a lot of people to serve. However, 5G technology is encroaching on the radio bandwidth of aircraft navigation systems; we’ll need more research to answer the 5G question regarding interference with aircraft navigation during landings. Remember that when we are discussing the two most critical phases of flight, takeoffs are optional – but landings are mandatory.

1,2024-08-01 14:31:43.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-01 11:52:44.000,"'I was up to my waist down a hippo's throat.' He survived, and here's his advice",https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/hippo-attack-avoid-survive-paul-templer/index.html,2023-04-12 12:44:43.000,"Paul Templer was living his best life. He was 28 and conducting tours in his native Zimbabwe, with a focus on photographic safaris. He had been away for a few years, including a stint in the British army. But he had returned to Africa’s bush country “and fell back in love with it. The wildlife, the flora, the fauna, the great outdoors, the space – just everything about it. I was at home.” Templer said Zimbabwe’s guide certification program was rigorous, and there was a lot of pride among the guides who passed. He reveled in showing tourists the area’s majestic wildlife – including the water-loving, very territorial hippos. “It was idyllic,” he told CNN Travel. “Life was really, really good – until one day I had a really bad day at the office.” March 9, 1996. A Saturday. Templer learned a good friend who was to lead a canoe safari down the Zambezi River had malaria. He agreed to take his pal’s place. “I loved that stretch of the river. It was an area I know like the back of my hand.” The expedition consisted of six safari clients (four Air France crewmembers and a couple from Germany), three apprentice guides plus Templer. They had three canoes – clients in the first two seats and a guide in the back. Then one apprentice guide was in a one-person safety kayak. And down the famed Zambezi they went. “Things were going the way they were supposed to go. Everyone was having a pretty good time.” Eventually, they came across a pod of about a dozen hippos. That’s not unexpected on the Zambezi, Africa’s fourth-longest river. They weren’t alarmed at first as they were at a safe distance. But “we were getting closer, and I was trying to take evasive action. … The idea was let’s just paddle safely around the hippos.” Templer’s canoe led the way, with the other two canoes and kayak to follow. He pulled into a little channel waiting on the others. But the third canoe had fallen back from the group and was off the planned course. Templer’s not sure how that happened. Suddenly, there’s this big thud. And I see the canoe, like the back of it, catapulted up into the air. Paul Templer “Suddenly, there’s this big thud. And I see the canoe, like the back of it, catapulted up into the air. And Evans, the guide in the back of the canoe, catapulted out of the canoe.” The clients managed to remain in the canoe somehow. “Evans is in the water, and the current is washing Evans toward a mama hippo and her calf 150 meters [490 feet] away. … So I know I’ve got to get him out quickly. I don’t have time to drop my clients off.” He yells to Ben, one of the other guides, to retrieve the clients who were in the canoe that had been attacked. Ben got the clients to safety on a rock in the middle of the river that hippos couldn’t climb. Meanwhile, Templer turned his canoe around to get Evans. The plan was to pull alongside of him and pull him into Templer’s canoe. “I was paddling towards him … getting closer, and I saw this bow wave coming towards me. If you’ve ever seen any of those old movies with a torpedo coming toward a ship, it was kind of like that. I knew it was either a hippo or a really large crocodile coming at me,” he said. “But I also knew that if I slapped the blade of my paddle on water … that’s really loud. And the percussion underwater seems to turn the animals away,” he said. “So I slapped the water, and as it was supposed to do, the torpedo wave stops.” He was getting closer to Evans, but they were also getting closer to the female and calf. “I’m leaning over – it’s kind of a made-for-Hollywood movie – Evans is reaching up. … Our fingers almost touched. And then the water between us just erupted. Happened so fast I didn’t see a thing.” What happened next was nightmarish and surreal. “My world went dark and strangely quiet.” Templer said it took a few seconds to figure out what was going on. “From the waist down, I could feel the water. I could feel I was wet in the river. From my waist up, it was different. I was warm, and it wasn’t wet like the river, but it wasn’t dry either. And it was just incredible pressure on my lower back. I tried to move around; I couldn’t. “I realized I was up to my waist down a hippo’s throat.” There’s a good reason a fully grown hippopotamus can fit a large portion of a fully grown adult in its mouth. Hippos can grow up to 16.5 feet long (5 meters), 5.2 feet tall (1.6 meters) and weigh up to 4.5 tons (4 metric tonnes), according to National Geographic. They sport enormous mouths and can open their strong jaws to 150 degrees. Their teeth might be the most frightening thing of all. Their molars are used for eating plants, but their sharp canines, which might reach 20 inches (51 centimeters), are for defense and fighting. Their bite is almost three times stronger than that of a lion. One bite from a hippo can possibly cut a human body in half. They’re found naturally in various parts sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in East and Southern Africa, living in or near rivers and other water sources. (And they are an invasive species in Colombia thanks to escapees from drug lord Pablo Escobar’s menagerie). Hippos are very territorial and might aggressively attack any animal encroaching on their territory, including hyenas, lions and crocodiles. They also kill people. That we know for sure. Many internet sources say around 500 a year, but an exact figure is still uncertain because some attacks and deaths come in very remote regions and don’t get reported. “The question I get asked the most when people find out I study hippos is: ‘Is it true hippos kill more people than any animal?’ Rebecca Lewison, conservation ecologist and associate professor at San Diego State University, told CNN Travel in an email interview. How to survive a cobra bite -- or better yet, avoid one entirely “I’m not entirely sure where that started but … there is no authority or reliable data. People are surprised that hippos kill people. They look slow, and they are mostly in water. There are some nonfatal interactions, but people (or hippos) tend to fare badly from interactions.” Dr. Philip Muruthi, chief scientist and vice president of species conservation and science of the African Wildlife Foundation, said the AWF doesn’t have a credible source on the number of attacks or fatalities either. While more stats need to be collected, one study found that the probability of being killed by a hippopotamus attack is in the range of 29% to 87% – higher than that of a grizzly bear attack at 4.8%, shark attack at 22.7% and crocodile attack at 25%. Those were rather bad odds of survival working against Templer. “I’m guessing I was wedged so far down its throat it must have been uncomfortable because he spat me out. So I burst to the surface, sucked a lungful of fresh air and I came face to face with Evans, the guide who I was trying to rescue. And I said, ‘We got to get out of here!’ ” So once again, I’m up to my waist down the hippo’s throat. But this time, my legs are trapped but my hands are free. Paul Templer But Evans was in serious trouble. Templer started swimming back for him “and I was just moving in for your classic lifesaver’s hold when – WHAM! – I got hit from below. So once again, I’m up to my waist down the hippo’s throat. But this time my legs are trapped but my hands are free.” He tried to go for his gun, but he was being thrashed around so much he couldn’t grab it. The hippo – which turned out to be an older, aggressive male – spat Templer out a second time. “This time when I come to the surface I look around, there’s no sign of Evans.” Templer assumed Evans had been rescued, and he tried to escape himself. “I’m making pretty good progress and I’m swimming along there and I come up for the stroke and swimming freestyle and I look under my arm – and until my dying day I’ll remember this – there’s this hippo charging in towards me with his mouth wide open bearing in before he scores a direct hit.” This time, Templer was sideways in the hippo’s mouth, legs dangling out one side of the mouth, shoulders and head on the other side of its mouth. “And then he just goes berserk. … When hippos are fighting, the way they fight is they try to tear apart and just destroy whatever it is they’re attacking,” Templer said. “For me, fortunately everything was happening in slow motion. So when he’d go under water, I’d hold my breath. When we were on the surface, I would take a deep breath and I would try to hold onto tusks that were boring through me” to stop from being ripped apart. Templer said one of the clients watching the horror later described it like a “vicious dog trying to rip apart a rag doll.” He figures the whole attack took about three and a half minutes. Meanwhile, apprentice guide Mack in the safety kayak – “showing incredible bravery, risking his life to save mine – pulls his boat in inches from my face.” Templer managed to grab a handle on the kayak, and “Mack dragged me to the relative safety of this rock.” The expedition was still in one hell of a mess, though. People living near hippo territory are more likely victims of attacks than tourists, said Lewison. “Most of the attacks happen in the water, but because hippos raid crops on farms, there are also attacks on people trying to protect their crops. There are some tourists, but largely the attacks are happening to local residents,” Lewison said. Human encroachment from Africa’s booming population makes matters worse, increasing the chances of deadly interactions, she said. You encounter a bear in the wild. Do you know what to do next? Despite the encounters gone bad, sub-Saharan Africa depends on hippos. “Hippos are important ecosystem engineers of the ecology of freshwater areas they inhabit. This is through nutrient recycling from dung (they consume large amounts of vegetation),” Muruthi said. “Hippos attack not to eat people, but to get them the hell away from them,” Lewison said. “I don’t think hippos are particularly aggressive, but I think when under pressure, they attack.” Back on the rock in the Zambezi, Templer asked Mack where Evans was. Mack said, “He’s gone, man, he’s just gone.” Templer knew he needed to come up with a plan to get them off the rock and to the riverbank, but “first I needed to settle myself down.” He assessed the situation: One man missing. The first aid kit, radio and gun all gone. Six scared clients, two canoes and one paddle left. And his own body was shattered. “My left foot was especially bad; it looked as if someone had tried to beat a hole through it with a hammer.” He couldn’t move his arms. One arm from elbow down was “crushed to a pulp.” Blood was bubbling out of his mouth. They realized his lung was punctured. Mack rolled Templer over and could see a gaping hole in his back and plugged it with Saran Wrap from a plate of snacks. Templer made the call: No matter the risk, they had to get off that rock. He was loaded into a canoe. Ben paddled. The hippo kept bumping the canoe. He went from being terrified to calm on that ride back. He described “a profound spiritual experience in which I had this incredible sense of peace and realization this was my moment of choice. Like do I go, or do I stay? Do I close my eyes and drift off, or do I fight my way through this and stick around?” It was so intense I thought I was going to die, and when I didn’t, I kind of wished I would. Paul Templer on the pain after the attack “I chose to stick around, and as soon as I made that choice, it was more pain than I could ever imagine I could endure. It was so intense I thought I was going to die, and when I didn’t, I kind of wished I would.” Ben and Templer made it out of the river, but without finding Evans. His body was found three days later. They concluded he had drowned because he didn’t have any signs of animal attack on him. “Evans did nothing wrong. The fact that he died was purely a tragedy.” Meanwhile, some people on shore had realized something was wrong in the river. A well-trained Zimbabwe rescue team was able to safely ferry everyone else off the rock. “And that was my bad day at the office.” Templer was out of the river but not out of the woods. It took eight hours to drive him to the nearest hospital. In a month’s time, he had several major surgeries. He thought he would lose one leg and both arms. His surgeon didn’t think he’d live. But not only did the surgeon save Templer’s life, he saved his legs and one arm. The other arm, however, was beyond salvation. If you're attacked by an alligator, here's how to fight for your life He realized that in the ICU when he woke up and was feeling for his left hand. It was gone. “I just remember feeling devastated. I spent my whole life being active and it was almost more than I could bare.” But then he was flooded with relief to realize his right arm and legs had been saved. For the next month, he was “emotionally all over the map.” He got physical and occupational therapy in Zimbabwe and then more in the United Kingdom. He got a prosthesis “and then just started trying to get back to life.” Templer, Muruthi and Lewison all say safe outings start with education – and avoiding trouble in the first place. “Hippos have no interest in dealing with people. Stay away from them, and they will leave you alone. They are not hunting humans,” Lewison said. “Do not get close to them,” Muruthi said. “They don’t want any intrusion. … They’re not predators; it’s by accident if they’re injuring people.” Want close-up views and photos of the creatures? Instead of venturing too close, invest in good binoculars and telephoto camera lenses. Follow the rules. If you are a tourist, and it says ‘Stay in your vehicle,’ then stay in your vehicle. Philip Muruthi on avoiding hippo attacks Do not walk along well-worn hippo paths, stay close to your group and don’t approach them from behind, Muruthi said. “Follow the rules. If you are a tourist, and it says ‘Stay in your vehicle,’ then stay in your vehicle. And even when you’re in your vehicle, don’t drive it right to the animal.” Muruthi also advised that your party make some noise in areas known for hippos. “It’s good for them to know you’re around.” “Hippos usually come out of water late in the evening and at night to forage, so avoid trekking along the river at that time,” Muruthi said. Also stay on high alert during the dry season when food is scarce. Get to know the signs of disturbed hippos, Muruthi advised, in case you wander too closely. An agitated one will open its mouth wide and yawn as aggressive display. Also watch for a head thrown back, shaking of the head, grunting and snorting. “These are signs you should have left already!” Muruthi said. If you’ve attracted unwanted attention, Muruthi said to always remember you cannot outrun a hippo. They may look sluggish, but they can run 30 mph (almost 43 kph). Instead, you should try to climb a tree or find an obstacle to put between you and the hippo such as a rock or anthill. Muruthi, Lewison and Templer all said never stay between a hippo and the water. If it’s charging you, run parallel to the water source. As with so many other protective female animals, never get between a mama hippo and her young, Templer said. He was alone, deep in the moutains. And a rattlesnake just bit him. What if you’re in a small watercraft? “Typically, if a hippo is going to be attacking, you’ll see it coming way before. There will be that bow wave. … If you slap the water, the percussion 99.9 times out of 100 will turn the hippo,” Templer said. “If you’re in a canoe and a hippo knocks you in the water, get away from the canoe. The hippo is going for this big shape, getting it off its territory.” It’s also safer to view hippos on the water in a larger vessel, which the animal would have a harder time capsizing, Muruthi said. Unlike attacks by some other wild animals, humans are almost defenseless once an attack by a large hippo begins. “Once attacked, there is nothing you can do,” Muruthi said. “Fight for dear life and watch for any chance to escape.” He said you could try to poke at the eyes or any spot that might inflict unexpected pain. But given the size just of a hippo head, even that’s a tall order. Hippos typically hole punch you, so there isn’t much you can do if they get hold of you. Rebecca Lewison “Hippos typically hole punch you, so there isn’t much you can do if they get hold of you,” Lewison said. Based on his attack, Templer said try not to panic “when dragged underwater. Remember to suck in air if on the surface.” Another hippo attack survivor in this National Geographic video also was able to conserve her breath. She also grabbed the hippo’s snout, and one expert in the video theorizes that might have startled the hippo into letting her go. Two years after that attack, Templer said that he and a team made the longest recorded descent of the Zambezi River to date. It took three months and covered 1,600 miles (2,575 kilometers). How did Templer find the resilience to reclaim his life? After a particularly rough day trying to maneuver in a wheelchair, he said that his surgeon told him: “You’re the sum of your choices. You’re exactly who, what and where you choose to be in life.” Templer said he focused on what’s possible vs. what he’s lost. “If you look for what’s possible, it generally is.” Templer later moved to United States; got married to the sister of a journalist on the record-setting Zambezi trip; wrote the book “What’s Left of Me”; and is a speaker. Should people be afraid to even go on safari – especially in hippo areas – after learning of a harrowing story like Templer’s? Muruthi said go, but go smartly. Be sure to get advice from professional tour guides – and then follow their guidance, Muruthi said. “In Kenya, for example, contact the Kenya Professional Safari Guides Association,” he said. Templer said his attack was an “anomaly,” and he doesn’t want anyone to be dissuaded by what happened on his 1996 river run. “My biggest counsel would be: Absolutely go and do it. But hook yourself up with someone who knows what they’re doing out there. But by all means, go out … and experience it.” © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

1,2024-08-01 14:31:43.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-01 11:52:44.000,They bought an abandoned 'ghost house' in the Japanese countryside,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/couple-turned-abandoned-japanese-home-into-guest-house/index.html,2023-04-10 12:22:59.000,"Editor’s Note: Sign up for Unlocking the World, CNN Travel’s weekly newsletter. Get the latest news in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments. He’d spent years backpacking around the world, and Japanese traveler Daisuke Kajiyama was finally ready to return home to pursue his long-held dream of opening up a guesthouse. In 2011, Kajiyama arrived back in Japan with his Israeli partner Hila, who he met in Nepal, and the pair set about finding the perfect location for their future venture. However, there were a couple of major stumbling blocks in their way. To start with, Kajiyama had very little money to speak of after years of globetrotting around destinations like Korea, Taiwan, India, Nepal, Guatemala, Cuba and Canada. He also happened to have his heart set on a traditional Japanese house, typically known as kominka, which are usually passed down over generations. “I wanted to have a traditional house in the countryside,” Kajiyama tells CNN Travel, explaining that he was determined to find two houses located next to each other, so that he and Hila could live in one, while the other would be a guesthouse that they’d run together. “I had a vision.” This US couple bought and renovated a 14th-century Italian home When he was unable to find anything that met his requirements, Kajiyama decided to shift his search to include the growing number of abandoned homes in the country. As younger people ditch rural areas in pursuit of jobs in the city, Japan’s countryside is becoming filled with “ghost” houses, or “akiya.” According to the Japan Policy Forum, there were 61 million houses and 52 million households in Japan in 2013, and with the country’s population expected to decline from 127 million to about 88 million by 2065, this number is likely to increase. Kajiyama was driving around Tamatori, a small village located in the Shizuoka prefecture, between Kyoto and Tokyo, surrounded by green tea plantations and rice fields, when he came across an elderly woman farming, and decided to approach her. “I said ‘Do you know if there are any empty houses around here?’ And she just pointed,” he recalls. He looked over at the area that she was signaling to and spotted two neglected houses side by side – a former green tea factory and an old farmer’s home – located close to a river. Both properties had been uninhabited for at least seven years and needed a huge amount of work. Kajiyama asked the woman to contact the owner to find out if they’d be interested in selling. “The owner said that no one could live there, as it was abandoned,” he says. “But he didn’t say ‘no.’ Everybody was always saying ‘no.’ But he didn’t. So I felt there was a small chance.” Expats buy Japanese country house for a song and get way more than they bargained for Kajiyama returned to visit the houses around five times, before going to visit the owner himself to negotiate an agreement that would see him use the old green tree factory as a home, and convert the farmer’s house into the guesthouse he’d always envisioned. While he was keen to purchase both of the homes, he explains that the traditions around home ownership in Japan mean that he is unable to do so until it’s passed down to the son of the current owner. “They said ‘if you take all the responsibility yourself, you can take it.’ So we made an agreement on paper,” he says. Both he and Hila were aware that they had a lot of work ahead of them, but the couple, who married in 2013, were thrilled to be one step closer to having their own guesthouse in an ideal spot. “It’s a very nice location,” says Kajiyama. “It’s close to the city, but it’s really countryside. Also people still live here and go to work [in the city]. “The house is also in front of the river, so when you go to sleep you can hear the sound of the water.” According to Kajiyama, the process of clearing the house, which is around 90 years old, before beginning the renovation works was one of the hardest parts of the process, simply because there was so much stuff to sort through. However, he was able to repurpose some of the items. During the first year, he spent a lot of time connecting with locals, gaining knowledge about the home, and helping the local farmers with farming for the first year or so. Although he wasn’t hugely experienced with renovation work, he had spent some time farming and completing building while he was backpacking, and had also taken odd jobs fixing peoples homes. He completed much of the work on the guesthouse himself, replacing the floors and adding in a toilet, which he says was a wedding present from his parents, at a cost of around $10,000. “I’m not really a professional,” he says.” I like to do carpentry and I enjoy creating things, but I have no experience in my background. “From my several years of backpacking, I saw so many interesting buildings, so many houses of interesting shapes and I’ve been collecting those in my brain.” Kajiyama was determined to keep the house as authentic as possible by using traditional materials. He saved money by collecting traditional wood from building companies who were in the process of breaking down traditional houses. “They need to spend the money to throw it away,” he explains. “But for me, some of the stuff is like treasure. So I would go and take the material that I wanted. “The house is a very, very old style,” he says. “So it wouldn’t look nice if I brought in more modern materials. It’s totally authentic.” He explains that very little work had previously been done to the house, which is quite unusual for a home built so many years ago. “It’s totally authentic,” he says. “Usually, with traditional houses, some renovations are made to the walls, because the insulation is not so strong. So you lose the style.” He says he received some financial support from the government, which meant he was able to bring in a carpenter and also benefited from Japan’s working holiday program, which allows travelers to work in exchange for food and board, when he needed extra help. After doing some research into Japanese guesthouse permits, he discovered that one of the simplest ways to acquire one would be to register the property as an agriculture guesthouse. As the area is filled with bamboo forests, this seemed like a no-brainer, and Kajiyama decided to learn everything he could about bamboo farming so that he could combine the two businesses. “This is how I started farming,” he says. In 2014, two years after they began working on the house, the couple were finally able to welcome their first guests. “It was a beautiful feeling,” says Kajiyama. “Of course, this was my dream. But people really appreciate that it was abandoned and I brought it back to life.” He says that hosting guests from all over the world has helped him to stay connected to his former life as a backpacker. “I stay in one place, but people come to me and I feel like I’m traveling,” he says. “Today, it’s Australia, tomorrow it’s the UK and next week South Africa and India. “People come from different places and they invite me to join them for dinner, so sometimes I join someone’s family life.” Sadly, Hila passed away from cancer in 2022. Kajiyama stresses that his beloved wife played a huge part in helping him achieve his dream of having a guesthouse and says he couldn’t have done it without her. “We were really together,” he adds. “She created this place with me. Without her it would not have been like this.” While the three-bedroom guesthouse, which measures around 80 square meters, has been open for around eight years, Kajiyama is still working on it, and says he has no idea when he’ll be finished. “It’s never ending,” he admits. “I’m halfway, I feel. It is beautiful already. But it started off abandoned, so it needs more details. And I’m getting better at creating, so I need time to do it.” He explains that he’s unable to complete work on the home while guests are there. And while the property is closed during the winter, he spends two months as a bamboo farmer and usually spends a month traveling, which doesn’t leave him much time for renovations. “Sometimes I don’t do anything,” he admits. Yui Valley, which offers activities such as bamboo weaving workshops, has helped to bring many travelers to the village of Tamatori over the years. “Most of the guests come after Tokyo, and it’s such a contrast,” he says. “They are really happy to share the nature and the tradition in our house. “Most people have dreamed of coming to Japan for a long time and they have a very short time here. “So they have such a beautiful energy. I’m happy to host in this way and join their holiday time. It’s very special [for me].” Kajiyama estimates that he’s spent around $40,000 on the renovation work so far, and if the feedback from guests, and locals, is anything to go by, it seems to have been money well spent. “People appreciate what I’ve done,” he adds. “So that makes me feel special.” As for Hiroko, the woman who pointed out the house to him over a decade ago, Kajiyama says she’s stunned at the transformation, and is amazed at how many international travelers are coming to Tamatori to stay at Yui Valley. “She cannot believe how much more beautiful it is [now],” he says. “She didn’t think it was going to be like this. So she really appreciates it. She says ‘thank you’ a lot.” Yui Valley, 1170 Okabecho Tamatori, Fujieda, Shizuoka 421-1101, Japan © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Due to its remoteness and short summer season, Mongolia has long been a destination overlooked by travelers. But as the country moves to further open up to tourism by easing its entry conditions for international visitors and upgrading its infrastructure, 2023 might just be the best time yet to get there. Here are 10 reasons travelers should start planning their long-dreamed-of Mongolia visit now. With the government of Mongolia declaring 2023 through 2025 the “Years to Visit Mongolia,” citizens from an additional 34 countries can now visit the country visa-free through the end of 2025. The addition of several European countries, including Denmark, France, Greece, Italy, Norway, Spain, and the UK, as well as Australia and New Zealand, now brings the total number of countries and territories on the visa-exempt list to 61. The full list is here. After years of delays, a pandemic and several controversies, the newly built Chinggis Khaan International Airport finally opened in the summer of 2021. With the ability to handle approximately 3 million passengers a year (double that of the old airport), the addition of 500 new aircraft parking spaces and the infrastructure to support an increase in domestic as well as budget flights, the airport is a welcome addition to the country’s efforts to grow tourism. Budget flights to Hong Kong from EZNIS Airways have been relaunched since the airport’s opening, and talks to resume direct flights to the United States are reportedly underway. The recently opened Chinggis Khaan Museum offers a beautiful, fresh look at Mongolia’s tumultuous history. With more than 10,000 artifacts spanning over 2,000 years, the museum explores the history of the Mongols and the empire they created – and eventually lost. The museum’s artifacts are presented over eight floors, with six permanent and two temporary exhibition halls. Guided tours are offered in English every Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. free of charge. When most people think of Mongolia, music festivals and conservation-focused art installations in the heart of one of the world’s largest deserts are the last things to come to mind. But that’s all changing thanks to festivals like Playtime, Spirit of Gobi, INTRO Electronic Music Festival and the Kharkhorum 360 Visual Art & Music Experience. Placing international bands, DJs, and musicians from around the world alongside Mongolia’s eclectic mix of rappers, bands and folk singers, the country just might be one of the world’s most underrated places for festival lovers. The annual Naadam event has always been a great reason to visit Mongolia, but now that the festival has just celebrated its 100 year anniversary, 2023 is as good a time as ever to attend. While the festival’s origins are rooted in the days of Genghis Khan, when he used horse racing, wrestling and archery competitions to keep his warriors in shape between battles, Naadam only officially became a national holiday 100 years ago. Today, the festival – held in Ulaanbaatar at the National Sports Stadium, has a few more bells and whistles than it did during the days of the Great Khan. A seat at July 11’s opening ceremony is always one of the hardest tickets to score in town. Mounted archery is seeing a resurgence in Mongolia thanks to guys like Altankhuyag Nergui, one of the most accomplished archers in the sport and his archery academy, Namnaa. Here, locals learn the fundamentals of Mongolian archery before mounting a horse and taking their new found skills to another level. In the summer months, students and academy members put on weekly shows for interested spectators. The academy also offers day-long training sessions for those wanting to try this intense sport. Speaking of giving life to Mongolia’s most ancient traditions, the resurrection of Mongol bichig, or the traditional Mongolian script written from top to bottom and read from left to right, has also seen a major resurgence in recent years. Visit the Erdenesiin Khuree Mongolian Calligraphy Center in Karakorum to learn from master calligraphist Tamir Samandbadraa Purev about this important cultural heritage. And, while you’re there, browse the yurts filled with Tamir’s works. Pair the release of Husqvarna’s new Norden 901 Expedition motorbike with Nomadic Off-Road’s newly announced Eagle Hunter Tour, and you have one of the fastest adventures in Mongolia. The tour takes six riders 1,700 kilometers from Ulaanbaatar to Bayan-Ulgii, where riders eventually meet their hosts, Mongolia’s famous eagle hunters. The only thing faster than this adventure is the rate at which Nomadic Off-Road’s tours sell out. Capturing the art of the last eagle hunters of Mongolia Professional musher Joel Rauzy has been leading dogsledding tours across the frozen Lake Khuvsgul for 18 years. With fewer crowds, lower hotel rates and the chance to see one of the largest freshwater lakes in the world completely frozen over, winter in Mongolia is something else to see and experience. Rauzy’s company, Wind of Mongolia, offers tours of the lake, where each person is assigned their own sled and dogs for the journey. Following Rauzy’s lead, mushers will make a loop of the lake. Activities include ice fishing, while travelers stay in winterized yurts and spend time with nomadic families along the journey. Nestled in the heart of Selenge province on the Yeruu River, Yeruu Lodge is the brainchild of Norwegian founder Eirik Gulsrud Johnsen, who first visited Mongolia in 2017. With a minimal Scandinavian-style restaurant and dining area, a handful of fully kitted out yurts for guests to stay in, two pétanque courts, kayaks, a driving range, mountain bikes and a yoga area, the lodge is a destination for nature lovers. Completely off-grid, the lodge runs off solar panels, uses of thermal heating, and all of the property’s water comes from an on-property well and is recycled after use. Additionally, all glass, metal and plastic used at the lodge is also recycled, and food waste is turned into compost used to grow vegetables, berries and herbs onsite. The lodge is set to open in April 2023. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved. CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."
1,2024-08-01 14:31:43.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-01 11:52:44.000,The most beautiful sections of China's Great Wall,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/china-beautiful-great-wall-sections-cmd/index.html,2023-09-18 02:57:08.000,"Editor’s Note: Monthly Ticket is a CNN Travel series that spotlights some of the most fascinating topics in the travel world. In September, we’re celebrating superlatives as we look at some of the world’s biggest, tallest and most expensive attractions and destinations. Having lived in Beijing for almost 12 years, I’ve had plenty of time to travel widely in China. I’ve visited more than 100 cities, not to mention countless towns and villages throughout the mainland’s 31 provinces. Looking back, I’ve come to realize it was my frequent visits to different parts of the Great Wall in Beijing that were a driving force behind my desire to explore the rest of the country and, along with it, the many sections of wall that lie outside the capital’s boundaries. Work on the Great Wall began more than 2,500 years ago, its origins dating back to China’s Spring and Autumn Period of around 770 BCE to 476 BCE. Various sections were added in subsequent eras as competing dynasties and factions sought to exert their control. Work eventually stopped in the 17th century. What's it like to walk the entire length of China's Great Wall? Though not a single, unbroken structure, the wall spans over 21,000 kilometers, winding through 15 provinces, 97 prefectures and 404 counties. And while certain sections have been incredibly popular among tourists, many parts have slipped into obscurity, disrepair and sometimes oblivion. Whether you’re planning to visit the Great Wall for the first time or the 50th, the following destinations are sure to make your trip to China even more worthwhile. (Check out the above video for dramatic aerial footage of some of these amazing sites.) The Great Wall is not simply a brick and mortar bulwark; in certain places, towers on jagged mountain peaks, fortress towns or even wide rivers count as sections of “wall.” The Turtle City, built in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) as part of the Great Wall’s “Yellow River Defense Line,” was completed in 1608 and was home to around 2,000 infantrymen and 500 cavalry units during peak use. Today, this fortress city is located in the Sitan Township of Jingtai County in north central Gansu province. While there aren’t many real turtles in the “Turtle City,” the garrison town got its nickname due to its unique shape. The south gate acts as the head and the west and east gates as the flippers. The town’s oval wall is the body, while the north gate acts as its tail. As one of the most well-preserved and truly authentic walled cities left in China today, it’s definitely worth your time. Staying in the Jingtai County center is recommended. The ancient city is only a 30-minute cab ride from your lodgings, so you can visit whenever the light is best for photos. When in Jingtai, try local specialties such as the five Buddha tofu and the Jingtai cold mixed noodles – both are spicy vegetarian dishes. A walk through the sprawling night market in Jingtai County People’s Square, which boasts more than 50 snack stalls, is also recommended for adventurous foodies. Regional Chinese food: 8 lesser-known cuisines worth trying Getting there: Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu province, has a major international airport and high-speed train connections from many cities in China. The drive to Yongtai Turtle City from downtown Lanzhou takes about 2.5 hours (195 kilometers). From Lanzhou Zhongchuan Airport, it’s only 1.5 hours (125 kilometers). Mutianyu and Jiankou are two parts of the same Stone Dragon – two contiguous sections of the Great Wall that together stretch for roughly 25 kilometers along Beijing’s mountaintops. Historical records show that millions of men spent centuries constructing the Great Wall. Stand atop the wall at either Mutianyu or Jiankou, and you’ll begin to comprehend the gravity of this statement. These two sections are arguably the two most classic examples of Ming Dynasty Great Wall surviving today, and climbing either is guaranteed to be a life-changing experience. Mutianyu is the best portion of the “tourist wall.” Restored in the 1980s, it’s very commercial but also superbly beautiful. Visitors not up for the hike can take a cable car to the top. Off-the-radar destinations every visitor to China should consider To the west of Mutianyu, Jiankou is colloquially known as the “wild wall” – no ticket needed and not commercialized. That being said, as of 2020, hiking at Jiankou has become somewhat frowned upon by the local government because of safety concerns. Mutianyu and Jiankou are less than a 90-minute drive (without traffic) from downtown Beijing, yet it’s highly recommended to enjoy a night in the countryside if time allows. Jiankou can be accessed via Xizhazi village; if dates align, you might even be able to spend a few days with William Lindesay, world-renowned Great Wall historian, and his wonderful family at The Barracks, their wall-side courtyard home. For lodgings around Mutianyu, The Brickyard is a superbly comfortable choice. In fall and spring, shades of the wall’s gray brick contrast with nature’s vibrant colors. Peak autumn foliage and spring cherry blossoms provide stunning backdrops for photos. For winter sports enthusiasts, there’s skiing and skating next to the Wall at locations not far from Mutianyu. Getting to Mutianyu: Restrictions on applying for temporary driving licenses in China were relaxed in September 2019, so renting a car as a foreign tourist is entirely possible. (International driving licenses are not accepted in China.) You can also hire a car with a driver for the day or take the Mutianyu Special Tourism Bus from the Dongzhimen Wai Bus Station. Getting to Jiankou: Renting a car or booking private transport is recommended. As Xizhazi is a small village, buses are scarce so it can take up to five hours to get there by public transport, as opposed to 90 minutes by car. Bataizi village sits just inside the Motianling section of the Great Wall and is home to the ruins of a Gothic church built in 1876 under the direction of a German missionary. The church has been damaged and repaired numerous times in its nearly 150-year history; the bell tower is the only part still standing. The juxtaposition of its ruins against the rammed-earth Great Wall makes Bataizi a unique place to spend a morning or afternoon. China's best new outdoor attractions After finishing your hike along the wall and visiting the church ruins, drop in to the village’s “new” church to say hello to Father Pan; if you speak Chinese, he can answer any questions about the village’s long connection with Catholicism. Besides Bataizi, Datong should also be on your tourist map; visiting the Yungang Grottoes (a UNESCO world heritage site) and the Hengshan Hanging Temple will make your trip even more memorable. Late summer is an ideal time to visit Bataizi, as you’ll see a wonderful contrast between the Great Wall and the lush green hills. Getting there: Bataizi village is 80 kilometers west of Datong, one of Shanxi province’s largest and most famous cities. Zuoyun County is only 22 kilometers away from Bataizi – about a 35-minute drive. Datong is easily accessible by plane or high-speed train from other cities in China; a taxi from downtown Datong to Bataizi should cost roughly 300 yuan (about $43). Alternatively, you can make your way to Zuoyun County by bus then hop in a taxi. In Datong, luxury seekers will want to head for the five-star Yunzhong Traditional Courtyard Hotel. Zuoyun County has one hotel that can accept foreigners: Zuoyun Jinshan International Hotel. Both can be found on popular hotel booking sites. As the locals say, Laoniuwan is where the Great Wall and the mighty Yellow River shake hands. The Laoniuwan Fortress was built in 1467, while the most famous tower of the Great Wall in this area, Wanghe Tower (literally meaning river-watching tower), was constructed in 1544. Laoniuwan village is located in Pianguan County, part of Xinzhou city in Shanxi province, just across the river from Inner Mongolia. Late summer or early fall is a great time to visit, as you’ll avoid the potentially dangerous mountain roads during spring rainstorms, or being uncomfortably cold in a place without great infrastructure. Along the Great Wall, there are only a few places where it meets bodies of water; of all those, this is the most stunning. A boat ride along the river is highly recommended. You’ll be able to soak in the natural beauty of the Yellow River Gorge while marveling at the steadfast resolve of these ancient architects. Swell life: China's surf scene is heating up Getting there: Laoniuwan is difficult to get to by public transportation. The best option is to rent or book a car to take you from Datong to Laoniuwan via Bataizi – this way, you’ll be able to see two incredible locations along the Great Wall in one trip. Pianguan is the nearest city, about one hour away. Pianguan does not have a train station or an airport. The only option is to arrive by bus. Shuozhou, 140 kilometers from Laoniuwan, has an airport opening later this year. Construction on the Great Wall in Simatai began in 1373. It was expanded and reinforced periodically throughout the Ming Dynasty. The Fairy Tower is one of the best-known towers of the wall at Simatai but also one of the least visited due to how difficult it is to access. Instead, aim to take in incredible views of the Fairy Tower from Wangjing Tower (just a few hundred meters away). It’s a journey that will satiate even the most adventurous hikers, yet can be done without any ropes, ladders or other essential safety gear. As with a visit to Mutianyu/Jiankou, this section of wall is guaranteed to deliver stunning views any time of year. My only suggestion is to wait for a clear day (usually visibility is great the day after it rains or snows), as the view from Wangjing Tower is unobstructed in every direction. The hike to the Fairy Tower will leave you in awe of the Northern Barbarians’ supposed determination to reach the capital; the mountains are nearly impassable on foot, let alone by horse, with sheer cliff faces on either side. It makes for absolutely world-class hiking and an interesting history lesson. Five-star lodgings are available at Hobo Farm; they also have an incredible restaurant that serves delicious Western and Chinese fare. For 4.5 star lodgings with a lower price tag, try Yatou’s Homestay. Both can be found on major hotel booking sites. Getting there: Both the Fairy Tower and Wangjing Tower should be accessed via Tangjiazhai village, located in Beijing’s Miyun district. Tangjiazhai village is 140 kilometers from downtown Beijing, depending on your route. Booking a private car from the city is probably the most time-effective way to get there. You can also take a high-speed train from Beijing Station to Miyun district and switch to a bus or taxi from there. Constructed during the reign of Emperor Jiajing (1507-1567), this single-wall section stands seven meters tall in some spots – no small feat considering it was made by piling stones. It’s located just across the road from the town of Dushikou, in Chicheng in Hebei province. The piled-stone wall at Dushikou is unique, as many other sections of the Great Wall close to Beijing were constructed using kiln-fired bricks. Dushikou is best visited in the summer, specifically July and August, when the rolling hills of the surrounding grasslands are peak green. Cool evenings make for perfect outdoor barbecue/bonfire weather. You’ll be able to find clean and comfortable farmhouse lodgings in Dushikou town; alternatively, Chicheng, 45 minutes away, has a range of hotels to choose from. Lamb skewers and roast leg of lamb are specialties in these parts, as this part of Hebei is very close to the border with Inner Mongolia. Noodle lovers should also try the local oat noodles, which are delicious. Getting there: Thanks to all the infrastructure built for the 2022 Winter Olympics, the drive to Dushikou has been shortened by almost two hours. If you prefer not to drive, hop on a bus to Chicheng from the Liuliqiao Transport Hub in Beijing and take a 45-minute taxi ride to Dushikou. Note that public transportation will take one or two hours longer than private car. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

Related gallery Inside 2022's 'CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute' Online voters selected her from among this year’s Top 10 CNN Heroes. Cheboi’s nonprofit, TechLit Africa, has provided thousands of students across rural Kenya with access to donated, upcycled computers — and the chance at a brighter future. Cheboi accepted the award with her mother, who she said “worked really hard to educate us.” At the beginning of her acceptance speech, Cheboi and her mother sang a song onstage that she explained had a special meaning when she was growing up. As CNN Hero of the Year, Cheboi will receive $100,000 to expand her work. She and the other top 10 CNN Heroes honored at Sunday’s gala all receive a $10,000 cash award and, for the first time, additional grants, organizational training and support from The Elevate Prize Foundation through a new collaboration with CNN Heroes. Nelly will also be named an Elevate Prize winner, which comes with a $300,000 grant and additional support worth $200,000 for her nonprofit. Cheboi grew up in poverty in Mogotio, a rural township in Kenya. “I know the pain of poverty,” said Cheboi, 29. “I never forgot what it was like with my stomach churning because of hunger at night.” A hard-working student, Cheboi received a full scholarship to Augustana College in Illinois in 2012. She began her studies there with almost no experience with computers, handwriting papers and struggling to transcribe them onto a laptop. Related article This CNN Hero upcycles old computers to open new worlds for young Kenyans Everything changed in her junior year, though, when Cheboi took a programming course required for her mathematics major. “When I discovered computer science, I just fell in love with it. I knew that this is something that I wanted to do as my career, and also bring it to my community,” she told CNN. Many basic computer skills were still a steep learning curve, however. Cheboi remembers having to practice touch-typing for six months before she could pass a coding interview. Touch-typing is a skill that is now a core part of the TechLit curriculum. “I feel so accomplished seeing kids that are 7 years old touch-typing, knowing that I just learned how to touch-type less than five years ago,” she said. Once she had begun working in the software industry, Cheboi soon realized the extent of which computers were being thrown away as companies upgraded their technology infrastructure. Related video Watch Sofia Carson perform 'Applause' at CNN Heroes celebration “We have kids here (in Kenya) — myself included, back in the day — who don’t even know what a computer is,” she said. So, in 2018, she began transporting donated computers back to Kenya — in her personal luggage, handling customs fees and taxes herself. “At one point, I was bringing 44 computers, and I paid more for the luggage than I did for the air ticket,” she said. A year later, she co-founded TechLit Africa with a fellow software engineer after both quit their jobs. The nonprofit accepts computer donations from companies, universities and individuals. The hardware is wiped and refurbished before it’s shipped to Kenya. There, it’s distributed to partner schools in rural communities, where students ages 4 to 12 receive daily classes and frequent opportunities to learn from professionals, gaining skills that will help improve their education and better prepare them for future jobs. “We have people who own a specific skill coming in and are just inspiring the kids (with) music production, video production, coding, personal branding,” Cheboi said. “They can go from doing a remote class with NASA on education to music production.” The organization currently serves 10 schools; within the next year, Cheboi hopes to be partnered with 100 more. “My hope is that when the first TechLit kids graduate high school, they’re able to get a job online because they will know how to code, they will know how to do graphic design, they will know how to do marketing,” Cheboi said. “The world is your oyster when you are educated. By bringing the resources, by bringing these skills, we are opening up the world to them.” CNN’s Anderson Cooper and ABC’s Kelly Ripa co-hosted the 16th Annual “CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute,” which featured more than a dozen celebrity presenters. “We’re so deeply honored to be here,” said actress and singer Sofia Carson, who perfomed a song with award-winning songwriter Diane Warren at the event. “Diane wrote this incredible anthem ‘Applause’ for those leading, surviving and fighting and tonight we dedicate this song and performance to our heroes.” Actor Aubrey Plaza introduced CNN Hero Aidan Reilly, who launched his nonprofit while home from college during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic. “From his pandemic couch, Aidan and his friends co-founded Farmlink Project,” Plaza said. The nonprofit connects excess food from farms across the US – food that would otherwise be wasted – to those who need it. “In just two years, he .. has moved more than 70 million pounds,” Plaza added.

And Emmy award-winning actor Justin Theroux brought his rescue dog Kuma, on the stage to honor Carie Broecker ​​and her nonprofit, Peace of Mind Dog Rescue. Two teenagers making a difference in their communities were also honored as 2022 Young Wonders: Ruby Chitsey, a 15-year-old from Harrison, Arkansas, started “Three Wishes for Ruby’s Residents,” which donates personal items to nursing home residents who couldn’t otherwise afford them. Sri Nihal Tammana, a 13-year-old from Edison, New Jersey, started “Recycle My Battery,” which keeps used batteries out of the ecosystem through a network of collection bins. The show also honored two Georgia poll workers, Shaye Moss and her mother Ruby Freeman, whose lives were upended after false allegations that they had been involved in election fraud spread on social media.

2,2024-08-01 14:31:43.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 12:31:38.000,"Hamas military chief was killed in July strike, Israel says",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv3gpy74ydo,2024-08-01 12:08:52.000,"Israel's military says it has confirmed that Hamas's military chief Mohammed Deif was killed in an Israeli air strike in the Gaza Strip last month. Deif was targeted in the strike on a compound in the Khan Younis area on 13 July. Hamas is yet to confirm his death. Israel says Deif was one of the figures responsible for planning the 7 October attacks in southern Israel in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. On Wednesday, Hamas political leader Ismael Haniyeh was killed during a visit to Iran. Israel has not commented on his death directly. In a statement on Thursday, the Israeli military said that ""following an intelligence assessment, it can be confirmed that Mohammed Deif was eliminated"" in the 13 July strike. Gaza’s Hamas-run health authorities said at the time that the air strike had killed more than 90 people, but denied that Deif was among the dead. Deif was widely seen as the second-ranking Hamas official in Gaza, behind Yahya Sinwar, the group's leader in the territory. Israel’s Defence Minister, Yoav Gallant, said the death of Deif is “a significant milestone” in the dismantling of Hamas. ""This operation reflects the fact that Hamas is disintegrating, and that Hamas terrorists may either surrender or they will be eliminated,"" he added. Mohammed Deif was appointed head of the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the military arm of the Hamas movement, in 2002. For decades he's been seen as one of Israel's most wanted men - and survived a reported seven assassination attempts. Reports in Israeli and Palestinian media say that Deif was born in Gaza's Khan Yunis refugee camp in 1965, when the territory was occupied by Egypt. As a young man in the 1980s, he joined Hamas and quickly rose to prominence. Israel accused him of planning and supervising bus bombings which killed tens of Israelis in 1996, and of involvement in the capture and killing of three Israeli soldiers in the mid-1990s.  Deif is also known to have helped engineer the construction of tunnels that have allowed Hamas fighters to enter Israel from Gaza. In 2014, Israel attempted to kill Deif with an air strike on a house in the Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood of Gaza, which killed Deif's wife, Widad, and their infant son, Ali. Israel thought it had killed Deif, too, but he was not in the building at the time. During the current conflict, Deif is believed to have directed Hamas' military operations from within underground tunnels inside Gaza.  Israel's confirmation of Deif's death comes at the end of a turbulent week in the Israel-Gaza conflict, which has stoked fears of a broader regional war. On Saturday, 12 Israeli children and young people were killed after a rocket fell on a football field in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed Lebanon-based Hezbollah, saying they would pay ""a heavy price"". On Tuesday, Israel retorted with air strike on Beirut which killed senior Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr, as well as four others, including two children. Hours later, Hamas’s political leader Ismael Haniyeh was killed in a strike on a building he was staying in during a visit to Iran’s capital, Tehran. Benjamin Netanyahu warned Israel that ""challenging days lies ahead"" after Iran threatened ""harsh punishment"". The Hamas leader was assassinated in Tehran, and it is widely believed Israel was behind the killing. Widely considered the group's overall leader, Haniyeh had been a prominent member since the late 1980s. Ismail Haniyeh was elected head of Hamas's political bureau in 2017. As Hamas's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh was a key interlocutor in the Gaza ceasefire negotiations. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

2,2024-08-01 14:31:43.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 12:31:38.000,Hamas leader's funeral draws crowds in Iran,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz5rd0p2lxeo,2024-08-01 08:55:11.000,"Thousands have turned out for the funeral procession in Iran of the Hamas political chief, Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in a strike in Tehran on Wednesday. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, led prayers for the Hamas leader, whose body will be buried in Qatar. US media have quoted Iranian officials as saying the supreme leader has ordered a direct attack against Israel, which it says was responsible for the attack on Iranian soil. Israel has not commented on the assassination directly. However, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country had delivered “crushing blows” to its enemies in recent days, including the killing of a senior Hezbollah commander in Lebanon hours before the Tehran strike. He warned Israelis that “challenging days lie ahead”, as fears of a wider conflict in the Middle East grow. ""Since the strike in Beirut, we have heard threats from all sides,"" he told a televised address. ""We are prepared for any scenario and we will stand united and determined."" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned against a ""dangerous escalation"" of hostilities in the region. Hamas's armed wing said the death of Haniyeh, who was widely viewed as the group's overall leader, would ""take the battle to new dimensions"" and have major repercussions. While Haniyeh's funeral was still taking place, Israel's military said it had confirmed that Hamas's military chief, Mohammed Deif, was killed in an air strike in the Gaza Strip last month. Deif was targeted in the strike on a compound in the Khan Younis area on 13 July. Hamas is yet to confirm his death. Israel says Deif was one of the figures responsible for planning the 7 October attacks in southern Israel in which 1,200 people were killed. Since the attack, Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas. Haniyeh, who played an important role in negotiations over a ceasefire in Gaza, was killed hours after attending the inauguration of Iran's new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, in Tehran. A senior Hamas official told the BBC the killing took place in the same building where Haniyeh had stayed during previous visits to Iran. Three Hamas leaders and a number of guards were with him in the same building, they said. Khalil Al-Hayya, a senior Hamas official, told a news conference that a missile hit Haniyeh ""directly"", citing witnesses who were with him. The group's leadership has been left in ""a state of shock"", top Hamas officials have told the BBC. Hours before Haniyeh was targeted, Israel said it had killed senior Hezbollah leader Fuad Shukr in Beirut. Israel believes he was responsible for a rocket attack that killed 12 people in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Saturday. Hezbollah has denied any involvement. The Iran-backed group confirmed Shukr's body was found among the rubble of the residential building which was struck. Four other people, including two children, were killed. Benjamin Netanyahu warned Israel that ""challenging days lies ahead"" after Iran threatened ""harsh punishment"". Israel had accused Fuad Shukr, a top Hezbollah commanders, of masterminding operations against Israel. The Hamas leader was assassinated in Tehran, and it is widely believed Israel was behind the killing. Iran says it will avenge the killing of Hamas's Ismail Haniyeh - but what will that mean in practice? The UN said a ""staggering number"" of Palestinians have been detained by Israel, with many facing torture and abuse. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

2,2024-08-01 14:31:43.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 12:31:38.000,Bowen: Israel's killing of Haniyeh deals hammer blow to ceasefire prospects,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp4wgqypwrxo,2024-07-31 19:04:05.000,"Israel has inflicted two devastating blows on its enemies. It has not confirmed that it killed the Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, but it is hard to see who else would have wanted him dead more than the Israelis. As for the Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr, Israel says he was killed in Beirut in an “intelligence-based elimination”. For Israel, everyone senior in Hamas is a legitimate target after the attacks of 7 October 2023, which inflicted the worst single day of bloodshed on Israel since independence in 1948. Fuad Shukr, Israel says, was killed because as a veteran Hezbollah commander he was responsible for the rocket attack that killed 12 children and young people in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Hezbollah has confirmed he was killed in the raid on Beirut. It denies carrying out the attack in the Golan. Once again, the Middle East is full of speculation that the all-out war feared since 7 October is imminent. The deadly irony is no side wants that war, but increasingly they are prepared to risk it. The Israelis have been under pressure from their American allies to calibrate their response to Hezbollah, inflicting a blow that will hurt the group without provoking a devastating retaliation and igniting a wider and deeper war. But two assassinations amount to a major gamble. The leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, might still decide that an attack on their stronghold in southern Beirut warrants a matching attack on Tel Aviv. Israel might also have calculated that Iran would not go to war over an assassinated Palestinian leader, even though his death in their capital, under their protection, is a humiliation. Killing Haniyeh, just after he had met the new Iranian president, is a dramatic display of Israel’s reach. The Islamic Republic thought it re-established deterrence when it fired hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel in April - that claim has now been exposed as hollow. April’s barrage was also retaliation, for the Israeli air strike that killed two Iranian generals in Iran’s embassy in Damascus. More retaliation looks certain from Iran, its ally Hezbollah or one of its proxies. Pro-Iranian militias in Iraq have made it clear that they blame the US equally for what has happened. In the Red Sea, the Houthis might redouble their attacks out of Yemen. There are limits to what Hamas can do, after months of the Israeli onslaught in Gaza. But the Israelis are on high alert for attacks in the occupied West Bank or inside Israel itself. It is important to realise that the Middle East is already in a regional war, but also to recognise that it could get much worse. Even so, this round of killing and retaliation might not be the spark that ignites all-out war, though it is easy to construct scenarios based on the clear and dangerous risks and realities in the world’s most turbulent region. Pulling back from the brink, repeatedly, is not making war any less likely. It makes it harder to construct a diplomatic pathway away from the looming threat of all-out conflict. The only credible first step for lowering the deadly temperature in the Middle East is a ceasefire in Gaza. In recent weeks the Americans have said that it was getting closer. That was always hard to imagine while the two sides’ definitions of an acceptable ceasefire were so far apart. For Hamas, a ceasefire meant an Israeli withdrawal and the end of hostilities. For Israel, it meant a pause that allowed for the release of some or all of the surviving hostages, and the right to resume the war afterwards. Now a ceasefire in Gaza looks as far away as ever, although the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said again that it remains America’s diplomatic priority. Ismail Haniyeh was a leading figure on the Hamas side in the ceasefire talks. With his colleagues, he communicated with the US and Israel via the head of the Egyptian secret service and the prime minister of Qatar, Sheikh Mohamed bin Jassim al Thani. The prime minister posted his response to the assassination of Haniyeh on X, writing: “Political assassinations and continued targeting of civilians in Gaza while talks continue leads us to ask how mediation can succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on the other side.” The assassination fits more closely into Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s conception of “total victory” over Hamas than into the American idea that a ceasefire is vital to avoid an even deeper regional catastrophe. It will also strengthen the belief held by Mr Netanyahu’s critics inside and outside Israel that he wants to prolong the war, to avoid the moment when he faces a reckoning of the mistakes he made that allowed Hamas the space to attack with such devastating consequences on 7 October. The Americans and French have also worked hard to find a diplomatic way to stop the border war between Israel and Hezbollah. But the vital first step would be a ceasefire in Gaza, and the prospect one was close has taken another hammer blow. Hamas has not confirmed the death of Mohammed Deif, who led the group's military wing. Iran has threatened “harsh punishment” for Israel, which it blames for Ismail Haniyeh's assassination in Tehran. Israel had accused Fuad Shukr, a top Hezbollah commanders, of masterminding operations against Israel. Widely considered the group's overall leader, Haniyeh had been a prominent member since the late 1980s. Ismail Haniyeh was elected head of Hamas's political bureau in 2017. Copyright 2024 BBC.

2,2024-08-01 14:31:43.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 12:31:38.000,Three men accused of plotting 9/11 reach plea deal - Pentagon,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cldy01z6xnpo,2024-08-01 10:21:29.000,"Three of the men accused of plotting the 11 September 2001 attacks on the US have entered into a pre-trial agreement, the Department of Defense says. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Walid Muhammad Salih Mubarak Bin Attash, and Mustafa Ahmed Adam al-Hawsawi have been held at the US Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for years without going to trial. Details of the deal have not been announced, but US news outlets say the men will plead guilty in exchange for the prosecution agreeing not to seek the death penalty. Nearly 3,000 people in New York, Virginia and Pennsylvania were killed in the attacks, which sparked the ""War on Terror"" and the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. Brett Eagleson, the president of 9/11 Justice, an organisation that represents 9/11 survivors and relatives of victims, said in a statement provided to the BBC that the families are “deeply troubled by these plea deals”. He said the process lacked transparency and urged the authorities to pursue more information on the role of Saudi Arabia in the attacks. Terry Strada, who lost her husband Tom, told the BBC’s Today Programme: ""It was a gut-punch to hear that there was a plea deal today that was giving the detainees in Guantanamo Bay what they want.” Ms Strada, the national chair of the campaign group 9/11 Families United, added: ""This is a victory for Khalid Sheikh Mohammad and the other two, it's a victory for them,"" she said.  The 9/11 attacks were the deadliest assault on US soil since the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, where 2,400 people were killed. The plea deal was first announced in a letter sent by prosecutors to the families of victims, according to The New York Times. It said the plea before a military court could come as early as next week. In its announcement, the US defence department said ""the specific terms and conditions of the pretrial agreements are not available to the public at this time"". The men have been accused of a litany of charges, including attacking civilians, murder in violation of the laws of war, hijacking and terrorism. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is widely considered the architect of the attack, in which hijackers seized passenger planes and crashed them into the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon outside of Washington. A fourth plane crashed into a field in Pennsylvania after passengers fought back. Mohammed, a US-educated engineer, was captured along with Hawsawi in Pakistan in March 2003. Prosecutors argued that he brought his idea of hijacking and flying planes into US buildings to al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, and later helped recruit and train some of the hijackers. He was subjected to a number of ""enhanced interrogation techniques"", including waterboarding - simulated drowning - at least 183 times before the practice was banned by the US government. The trial has been delayed for so long partly because of fears that the so-called brutal interrogation techniques which critics say amounted to torture could have undermined the evidence against the detainees. “This is the least bad deal in the real world that would ever happen,” national security analyst Peter Bergen told CNN. In September, the Biden administration reportedly rejected the terms of a plea deal with five men held at the US Navy base in Cuba, including Mohammed. The men had reportedly sought a guarantee from the president that they would not be kept in solitary confinement and would have access to trauma treatment. The White House National Security Council said that the president's office was told on Wednesday of the new deal and had played no role in negotiations. Fifteen of the 19 plane hijackers were Saudi nationals and families are bringing a lawsuit against the kingdom, which denies any involvement. Republicans were quick to attack the Biden administration for striking a deal with the accused. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell condemned the move as ""a revolting abdication of the government's responsibility to defend America and provide justice"". ""The only thing worse than negotiating with terrorists is negotiating with them after they are in custody,"" he said.

2,2024-08-01 14:31:43.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 12:31:38.000,'Is she black or Indian?': Trump questions Harris' racial identity,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c06k07dn1zjo,2024-07-31 21:28:44.000,"Donald Trump has questioned Kamala Harris' racial identity during a heated exchange at a convention for black journalists. Trump falsely claimed the vice-president and presumptive Democratic nominee had only emphasised her Asian-American heritage until recently when, he claimed, ""she became a black person"". ""I didn't know she was black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn black and now she wants to be known as black,"" he said at the National Association of Black Journalists convention in Chicago on Wednesday. ""So I don't know - Is she Indian? Or is she black?"" Ms Harris said Trump's remarks were ""the same old show"" of ""divisiveness... and disrespect"". ""The American people deserve better,"" she told a meeting of the historically black sorority Sigma Gamma Rho in Houston. ""We deserve a leader who understands that our differences do not divide us - they are an essential source of our strength."" Ms Harris is the first black and Asian-American vice-president, with Indian and Jamaican-born parents. She attended Howard University, a historically black university, and joined the predominantly black Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. She became a member of Congressional Black Caucus after entering the Senate in 2017. Trump's claims prompted a heated exchange with ABC News' correspondent Rachel Scott, one of the moderators of the Chicago event. ""I respect either one,"" the Republican said in reference to Harris' racial identity. ""But she obviously doesn't because she was Indian all the way and then all of a sudden she made a turn and she became a black person."" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said no-one ""has any right to tell someone who they are, how they identify. That is no-one's right."" ""Since when is Donald Trump, with his long and ugly history of racism, the arbiter of Blackness?"" congressman Ritchie Torres of New York posted on X. He described Trump as a “relic of a racist past"". The Republican nominee and former president has a history of attacking his opponents on the basis of race. He falsely accused Barack Obama, the country's first black president, of not being born in the US. Trump attacked the former UN ambassador and his Republican primary opponent Nikki Haley by falsely claiming she could not be president because her parents were not US citizens when she was born. Ms Harris has faced a series of attacks since becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee. Republicans have criticised the decision, saying she was chosen only because of her race. Tim Burchett, a Republican congressman from Tennessee, called her a ""DEI vice-president"" - a reference to diversity, equity and inclusion programmes. On Wednesday, Scott pushed Trump to clarify whether he believed Ms Harris was a ""DEI hire"". He replied: ""I really don't know, could be."" Ms Harris has described growing up engaged with her Indian heritage and often visited the country. Her mother also immersed her two daughters in the black culture of Oakland, California - where she was raised, she said. Trump also attacked Ms Harris' credentials during the discussion, saying she had failed her bar exam early in her legal career. His comments were met with murmurs from the crowd. ""I'm just giving you the facts. She didn't pass her bar exam and she didn't think she would pass it and she didn't think she was going to ever pass it and I don't know what happened. Maybe she passed it,"" he said. Ms Harris graduated from the University of California Hastings College of Law in 1989. The New York Times reported that she failed her first attempt and passed at the second. The state bar of California says fewer than half of those who sit the test pass on the first attempt. The Chicago discussion began with a contentious back and forth between Scott and the former president. Trump accused the journalist of giving a ""very rude introduction"" when she began the conversation asking about his past criticism of black people. She cited Trump calling black journalists' questions ''stupid and racist'' and that he had ''dinner with a white supremacist at your Mar a Lago resort''. ""I love the black population of this country, I’ve done so much for the black population of this country,” he responded. The former president criticised the conversation hours later on his social media platform. ""The questions were rude and nasty, often in the form of a statement, but we CRUSHED IT!"" he said.

2,2024-08-01 14:31:43.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 12:31:38.000,Why the world's anti-doping agency feels stuck between US and China,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2gygj1d28o,2024-08-01 00:53:05.000,"The World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) says it is ""unfairly caught"" in a row between the US and China, with their geopolitical tensions spilling onto the Olympic stage. China's top swimmers have been in the spotlight after a slew of doping allegations, followed by contentious US claims that Wada was covering it up. Chinese swimmers headed to Paris were drug-tested twice as much as some other nations, which, in turn, has fuelled accusations of a conspiracy to disrupt their performance. Wada said in its statement on Tuesday that it had been caught in ""the middle of geopolitical tensions between superpowers but has no mandate to participate in that"". ""Certain individuals [in the US] are attempting to score political points purely on the basis that the athletes in question are Chinese,"" Wada head of media relations James Fitzgerald told the BBC. ""The result is that it has created distrust and division within the anti-doping system."" A trade war, geopolitical rivalries and Beijing's friendship with Russia have soured relations between the world's two largest economies. It's little surprise that some of those tensions play out in competitive sports but now they appear to be driving a harder - and harsher - wedge. Last week, Wada had said it was considering legal action against its US counterpart, Usada, over ""defamatory"" accusations. The latter had accused Wada and China's anti-doping agency, Chinada, of being among the ""dirty hands in burying positive tests and suppressing the voices of courageous whistleblowers"". US lawmakers, too, have accused Wada of failing to investigate doping allegations against Chinese swimmers properly. And on Tuesday they introduced a bill that would give the White House power to cut funding to the agency. ""When members of congress and senators are inserting themselves into the largely technical world of anti-doping, it ceases to be about scientific and legal analysis, and it drifts into the political realm,"" said Mr Fitzgerald. Wada's statement on Tuesday followed reports in the New York Times about a previously undisclosed case involving two Chinese swimmers - including one on this year’s Olympic team - who were investigated for doping. They had tested positive for a banned steroid in 2022, but they were cleared to compete. China's anti-doping agency concluded that the athletes had most likely consumed the steroid unknowingly while eating contaminated burgers. Usada accused Wada of letting China ""compete under a different set of rules, tilting the field in their favour"". But Wada defended the decision. It said the athletes’ nutritional supplements and hair tests had returned negative results, and that both swimmers also provided control samples that were negative in the days before and after the one test that was positive. It added that the two swimmers were suspended for more than a year and then their cases were closed. Their cases are part of a ""wider series of cases involving [Chinese] athletes from different sports"", the agency said, adding that, ""based on the number of cases, clearly there is an issue of contamination in several countries around the world"". In a statement in June, Wada noted that athletes who eat meat sometimes test positive for drugs if they have ingested clenbuterol, a banned substance which is used as a growth promoter for farm animals. That statement, in response to questions from the New York Times, said the agency was investigating instances of contamination in China as well as Mexico, Guatemala and other countries. The agency's boss Olivier Niggli pointed out at the time that US media had ""only asked questions about China when meat contamination is an issue in many countries"", and referred to ""attempts to politicise anti-doping"". All of this follows a bigger controversy in April, when the New York Times reported that 23 Chinese swimmers had tested positive for a performance-enhancing drug months before the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. But they were cleared to compete after Chinese officials found the results were caused by contamination. The 30-member team went on to win six medals, inlcuding three golds in Tokyo. Eleven of those who tested positive were also picked to be part of the Chinese swimming team for the Paris Olympics. US swimmer and 11-time Olympic medalist Katie Ledecky had said her confidence in anti-doping regulators was at an ""all-time low"" after the news about the 23 Chinese swimmers. Wada's investigation, however, found that it was ""not in a position to disprove the possibility that contamination"" was the source of the drug, heart medication trimetazidine (TMZ). It said the contamination theory was supported by ""the combination of the consistently low concentrations of TMZ as well as no doping pattern"" among the tested athletes. That is, their test results over several days were not consistent, veering between negative and positive. An independent investigation found that Wada did not mishandle the case or show bias towards the Chinese swimmers. The scandals upped the pressure on anti-doping officals and by the time the Chinese swimming team arrived in Paris, they were being tested far more than is standard. Since January, each of the team's 31 members have been tested, on average, 21 times by various anti-doping organisations, according to World Aquatics, which oversees water sports. In comparison, Australia's 41 swimmers have been tested an average of four times and the 46 US swimmers, an average of six times. The flurry of tests has sparked another set of allegations. The state-run Chinese newspaper the Global Times blames Western powers for ""abusing doping tests to disrupt [the] Chinese swimming team"". Speaking to the Global Times, an international politics professor in Shanghai, accused the US of dominating anti-doping rules. Shen Yi suggested that the ""relentless and unethical testing"" had disrupted the Chinese team's training, which she called a ""disgrace to the Olympics"". Chinese swimmer Qin Haiyang, who holds the world record for the 200m men's breastroke, said this testing ""proves that European and American teams feel threatened by the performances of the Chinese team in recent years"". ""Some tricks aim to disrupt our preparation rhythm and destroy our psychological defence. But we are not afraid,"" he said on Chinese social media platform Weibo. Qin, who won golds in the 50m, 100m and 200m breaststroke at the world championships last year, finished in seventh place in the men's 100m breaststroke final on Sunday. This criticism was echoed by former Chinese diving champion Gao Min who said the rigorous testing had ""disrupted our Chinese swimming team"" and called Qin's performance ""the worst in any competition over the past two years”. China's current medal tally stands at one gold, two silver and two bronze. China's “butterfly queen”, Zhang Yufei, who won a silver in the 100m event in Tokyo, was in tears over her bronze finish on Monday but said the doping tests did not have a big impact on her. While they were a ""bit annoying"", she said it was the pressure that was ""far greater"" than she had imagined.

2,2024-08-01 14:31:43.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 12:31:38.000,Maduro promises voting data as observers say Venezuela election 'not democratic',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxx28wex0w6o,2024-08-01 04:30:31.000,"Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has insisted his party is ready to present all the vote tallies from his country's disputed election after election observers said it ""could not be considered democratic"". The National Electoral Council (CNE) declaration that Mr Maduro won has sparked two days of protests, with the country's opposition saying voting tallies show its candidate, Edmundo González, won by a wide margin. NGOs say there have been at least 11 deaths in protest-related violence and that dozens more have been injured. Speaking to journalists on Wednesday, Mr Maduro said again that his government’s reason for not publishing the electoral results was because of a “hack” on the electoral council website. He also claimed he had “proof” that the opposition leader, María Corina Machado, was behind “violence”. He alleged that protesters were ""attacking"" the constitution and asked the Supreme Court to take action, which could pave the way for more mass arrests of opposition figures or protesters. Top US diplomat for Latin America, Brian Nichols, said the evidence showed President Maduro overwhelmingly lost by ""millions"" of votes - endorsing vote tallies released by his opponents. ""The tabulation of these detailed results clearly show an irrefutable result: Edmundo González won with 67% of these votes compared to 30% for Maduro,"" he said in remarks at an Organisation of American States (OAS) meeting, AFP reported. ""While not a total result, there are not enough votes in remaining tally sheets... to overcome such a deficit,"" he continued. Earlier on Wednesday the US-based Carter Center - which was invited by Venezuelan officials to monitor Sunday's presidential poll - said it could not ""verify or corroborate the results of the election declared by CNE"". The Carter Center also said that the CNE's failure to announce the detailed results by polling station ""constitutes a serious breach of electoral principles"". It added that the CNE had ""demonstrated a clear bias in favour of the incumbent [President Nicolás Maduro]"" and accused the CNE of a ""complete lack of transparency in announcing the results"". With its statement, the Carter Center has joined a long list of countries and organisations pressuring the CNE to release detailed voting data at the polling station level, among them the US, Brazil and the EU. The US state department said the international community was running out of patience waiting for Venezuelan electoral authorities to release full detailed data on their country's election. The Carter Center statement is embarrassing for the Maduro government because its observers had been complimentary about the Venezuelan electoral system in the past. President Maduro has often quoted a remark by the Carter Center's founder, former US President Jimmy Carter, who in 2012 said that ""of the 92 elections that we've monitored, I would say the election process in Venezuela is the best in the world"". More than 1,000 people have so far been detained, according to Venezuela's attorney general, who also said that two members of the security forces had died in the protests. Ms Machado has urged her supporters to remain peaceful even if provoked by the government and its allies. On Tuesday, a close ally of President Maduro, National Assembly leader Jorge Rodríguez, called for the arrest of Ms Machado and Mr González, accusing them of leading a ""fascist conspiracy"". President Maduro told media on Wednesday Ms Machado and Mr González ""should be behind bars"", AFP reported. The Costa Rican foreign minister later offered Ms Machado and Mr González political asylum, saying that his government ""had been informed of arrest warrants"" against the two. Ms Machado thanked the Costa Rican government but said that it was her ""responsibility to continue this struggle alongside the people"". In a separate social media post late on Wednesday, Ms Machado urged her supporters to ""mobilise"". She wrote on X: ""It's time to trust in each other. To stay active and firm. ""It took time to win; now it's time to collect."" Videos show opposition protesters in multiple locations taking to the streets. Security forces fired tear gas and rubber bullets against people as thousands gathered in Caracas. Maduro's supporters are jubilant but the opposition is demanding proof of the voting numbers. Election officials say the president has an unassailable lead but the opposition vows to contest the result. Both Maduro and González, the opposition candidate, have claimed victory in this presidential election. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

Rory Golden was on the Oceangate expedition when contact with the sub and its five passengers was lost on a dive to the Titanic in June 2023. “We had this image in our heads of them being down there, running out of oxygen in the freezing cold, getting terribly frightened and scared,” he said. But after learning the sub had imploded just hours into the dive, he said it was a comfort to know those onboard hadn’t suffered. Mr Golden was on the Polar Prince support ship to give presentations about the Titanic when the submersible went missing. “When the sub was overdue we weren't unduly concerned because communications break down a lot in the ocean,” he explained. “But when the alarm was finally raised, that's when we realised that there were some serious issues.” A major search and rescue operation was launched by the US Coast Guard. A few days in, sounds of banging were detected underwater raising hope that these were coming from the missing sub. But it's now known that those onboard most likely died instantly after Titan suffered a catastrophic failure as it neared the Titanic at the bottom of the Atlantic. “We lived in false hope for four days,” Mr Golden said. “There’s still a lot of questions to be answered.” Those who perished were British explorer Hamish Harding, the British-Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman, Stockton Rush, the CEO of Oceangate, and French diver Paul Henri - or PH - Nargeolet. Rory Golden was a close friend of PH - a veteran deep sea explorer. He is now on the first expedition to the Titanic since the tragedy - an expedition that PH Nargeolet was supposed to be leading. A plaque is being laid in his honour at the wreck site and a memorial service for all those who died on the sub has been held at sea. Mr Golden told the BBC he was one of the last people to see PH alive. “He left the ship in great spirits, in great form and he was happy. He was going somewhere that he wanted to be.” Rory Golden had also visited the Titanic on the Oceangate sub. ”PH and I had discussed the submersible in the past and I had actually made a dive in it myself the year before,” he said. “And I'm here - as are many others. The Titan sub had made 15 dives to the Titanic up to that point, so it had worked. “I was comfortable, I spent 12 hours at the Titanic and it was a whole different experience being in a submersible that I could actually move around quite well in.” He told the BBC that he didn’t regret his dive at all. “It wasn't my time,” he said. “You never know when your time is going to come. And that certainly brought that home to all of us.” The discovery of the wreckage of Titan four days after it went missing confirmed the fate of those onboard. “We all cried when the remains were found of the sub,” he said. “A special bond has been formed between all of us who were there on the ship that week. And that's a bond that will always be there.” Industry experts had raised many serious questions about the safety of the Titan submersible prior to the dive. Investigations by the US Coast Guard and Canadian Coast Guard are still ongoing. They are likely to call for changes to ensure such a tragedy doesn’t happen again. A new expedition aims to document the world's most famous shipwreck in unprecedented detail. Graham Padden from Southport had a place booked but was unable to raise the money needed in time. The private submersible industry was shaken after the implosion of the OceanGate Titan sub last year. . Mary Roberts survived both the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 and the Rohilla in 1914.

2,2024-08-01 14:31:43.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 12:31:38.000,'Slave auction' pupils to face disciplinary in South Africa,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0ve3r5ydjvo,2024-07-31 18:34:18.000,"Four schoolchildren in South Africa are to face a disciplinary hearing over a viral video in which black students are seen being auctioned off as slaves, the authorities in Cape Town have told the BBC. The footage, showing pupils in a cage while other students bid for them, caused outrage when it was shared on social media last Friday. It was filmed at Pinelands High School and involved students in grade eight, which is the first year of secondary school when pupils are aged around 14. The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) has said it has opened its own investigation into the incident. It comes as two other schools in the country - where white-minority rule ended three decades ago with the election of anti-apartheid fighter Nelson Mandela as president - are dealing with alleged racist incidents. “It is disturbing that these incidences continue to occur 30 years into democracy,” the SAHRC said, adding it was even more distressing that they had occurred in schools. The four Pinelands High School students believed to be behind the mock auction are currently suspended. “The investigation is ongoing and nearing completion with 24 learners having been interviewed in the first two [school days] since the allegations were made,” Bronagh Hammond, spokesperson for the Western Cape Education Department, said on Wednesday in a statement sent to the BBC. “Steps will also be taken against other learners who may have transgressed certain provisions within the code of conduct,” she added. The incident first came to light after one of the pupils showed the footage to his mother, Merle Potgieter, who then told the school's management and local media. She says her son, who is 14, fought off boys who were attempting to force him into the caged enclosure alongside other black boys who were already inside it. According to Ms Potgieter the alleged perpetrators were coloured - which is a South African term meaning mixed-race. In the footage of the mock auction, children can be heard calling out various bids of up to 100,000 rand ($5,400; £4,200). ""Going once... going twice... sold!"" one boy can be heard shouting. Counselling support had been prioritised for those affected - and all grade eight pupils had had debriefing sessions, Ms Hammond said. Slavery in Cape Town dates back to the 1650s when the Dutch colonised the peninsula and thousands of enslaved people were brought to the region from south-east Asia, Madagascar and Mozambique. Today Cape Town is considered one of the most racially segregated and unequal cities in South Africa, despite its multi-ethnic mix. This is due to the legacy of apartheid, when the white regime in the 1950s pushed black and mixed-raced communities into segregated townships outside the city. The apartheid government also entrenched a racial hierarchy, which put black people right at the bottom. On Tuesday, MP Makhi Feni, chair of the parliamentary committee on education, urged the schools at the heart of the latest scandals to “consider meaningful programmes that will foster social cohesion and South African-ness”. “The question we all ought to ask genuinely is what emboldens a person, hardly a teenager, with no knowledge of where we come from as a country, to act in a manner that points to racism. Surely, our children are not and should not be racist,” he said. Meanwhile, the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party is demanding that the pupils be suspended for at least two years and perform ""community service in black areas"". It has threatened to call protests and shut down the school if it finds the authorities' ultimate handling of the incident less than satisfactory.

Nearly 200 people are still missing after Mundakkai and Chooralmala areas in Wayanad district were flattened by thick torrents of mud and water on Tuesday. Rescue operations have been hampered by heavy rains in the region all week. The army is constructing a temporary bridge to Mundakkai, which is across a swollen river, to help stranded residents and search for more survivors. Health officials reported 256 autopsies, but that included a number of body parts. On Thursday, Wayanad remained on high alert for more rains as schools and colleges were closed for the day. The hilly district is known for its cardamom plantations and tea estates and has several popular tourist spots. Officials said nearly 1,600 people had been rescued from the affected villages and tea estates. But migrant workers from the estates were among those still missing. More than 8,000 people have been moved to 82 relief camps set up in the district, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said. The army is now building a temporary metal bridge to Mundakkai village, which is among the worst affected by the landslides. Earlier, rescuers had constructed a temporary pedestrian bridge and used ropes to rappel across the river to reach stranded people there and move the injured to hospitals. But heavy rains and strong river current had made it difficult to carry out full-fledged rescue work. The temporary metal bridge is expected to be complete by Thursday evening. It will allow ambulances and heavy machinery to move rubble and search for survivors, Major General Vinod Mathew told reporters. Meanwhile, the air force is conducting sorties to identify areas with survivors and distribute relief material. Three army sniffer dogs were expected to reach the disaster zone to help detect people still trapped under the rubble. ""Still large areas are to be explored and searched to find out whether live people are there or not,"" senior police officer MR Ajith Kumar told AFP news agency on Wednesday. TV footage showed harrowing scenes at relief camps and hospitals as survivors searched for their loved ones or waited for news of them. One man listed out names of those who had still not been found as he told Manorama News, ""My house was spared but I have lost many children who were like my own."" At a community centre that had bodies displayed for identification, a young man told The NewsMinute that he had identified two of his uncles, but was still searching for seven other relatives. ""I am in touch with people at other centres where bodies are placed and they are sending me pictures, but I am yet to identify any of my other missing relatives,"" he told the news site. With more heavy rainfall forecast for the district, the government has warned residents to be prepared for flash floods. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

2,2024-08-01 14:31:43.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 12:31:38.000,Turbulence takes instant noodles off Korean Air menu,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2grdydv65o,2024-08-01 07:22:25.000,"If you're taking a flight on Korean Air, you might soon notice something missing from your menu - a cup of instant noodles. From 15 August onwards, the carrier will stop serving the noodles to economy class passengers. It said the increased risk of turbulence, narrow aisles and passengers sitting closely together could mean ""burn incidents occur frequently"". Business and first class fliers, however, will continue to enjoy the treat. The snack has long been a passenger favourite and something the carrier is widely known for. Many praise the fact that it is available for free on request. In a statement, the carrier said that since 2019 the number of times turbulence had occurred on its flights had doubled. It added that in economy class, several cups of noodles are all served at once, saying that the ""risk of burns is greater with passengers crowded together"". But in business and first class the snacks are brought individually to these passengers, reducing the likelihood of spillage in the event of turbulence, the carrier said. Up until now, the Korean carrier had been providing the noodles for free to passengers on longer routes. But this will now be replaced with sandwiches, corn dogs, pizza and ""Hot Pockets"" - crusty turnovers filled with cheese, meat and vegetables. The move sparked discussion on social media. Some users expressed relief, while others pointed out that the carrier was still serving other items that could cause burns. ""Aren't coffee and tea hot?"" said one comment. However, another called it a ""very good decision"", saying they had always been ""nervous"" that they would be scalded. One user said they had hoped the instant noodles would be removed ""because of the smell"". Korean Air said it will ""continue to seek service methods that are safe while increasing customer convenience and satisfaction"". Earlier this year, Singapore Airlines said it would stop serving hot drinks and meals during turbulence as part of a ""more cautious approach"". A 73-year-old British passenger died and dozens more were injured when flight SQ 321 encountered turbulence over Myanmar and was diverted to Thailand in May. Turbulence is one of the most unpredictable of all weather phenomena, with severe turbulence becoming more likely with climate change, recent research shows.

2,2024-08-01 14:31:43.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 12:31:38.000,Uber strikes EV deal with Chinese Tesla rival BYD,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cley0xn8e88o,2024-08-01 04:30:56.000,"Uber has announced a deal which aims to bring 100,000 electric vehicles (EVs) made by China's BYD to the ride-hailing giant's global fleet of cars. The two companies say they will offer Uber drivers incentives to switch to electric cars, including discounts on maintenance, charging, financing and leasing. The multi-year agreement will be rolled out first in Europe and Latin America, before being made available in the Middle East, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The announcement comes as EV sales around the world have slowed and Chinese car makers face higher import charges in places like the US and the European Union. ""The companies aim to bring down the total cost of EV ownership for Uber drivers, accelerating the uptake of EVs on the Uber platform globally, and introducing millions of riders to greener rides,"" the two firms said in a statement. They also said they will work to integrate BYD's self-driving technologies into Uber's platform. Earlier this year, Uber said it was working with Tesla to promote EV adoption among its drivers in the US and planned to develop a purpose-built EV with South Korean car giant Kia. The US, the European Union and other major markets have recently announced tariff hikes on China-made EVs in moves aimed at protecting their car industries. The move has prompted BYD and other Chinese EV makers to expand their production facilities outside China. In July, BYD agreed a $1bn (£780m) deal to set up a manufacturing plant in Turkey. The new plant will be able to produce up to 150,000 vehicles a year, according to Turkish state news agency Anadolu. The facility is expected to create around 5,000 jobs and start production by the end of 2026. Also last month, BYD opened an EV plant in Thailand - its first factory in South East Asia. BYD said the plant will have an annual capacity of 150,000 vehicles and is projected to generate 10,000 jobs. At the end of last year, BYD announced it would build a manufacturing plant in EU member state Hungary. It will be the firm's first passenger car factory in Europe and is expected to create thousands of jobs. The company has also said it is planning to build a manufacturing plant in Mexico. BYD, which is backed by veteran US investor Warren Buffett, is the world’s second-largest EV company after Elon Musk's Tesla. MADE NE aims to create a new generation of workers in the electric vehicle and battery sectors. More than 1.8 million cars are due to get a software fix, US safety regulators said. Pilling work is to start imminently at the multi-billion-pound car battery factory near Bridgwater. The aim to train a skilled workforce for sectors including electric vehicle and battery production. A number of on-street locations have been proposed and residents can still make suggestions. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

2,2024-08-01 14:31:43.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 12:31:38.000,Italy opens controversial migrant centre in Albania,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lke090kgko,2024-08-01 07:20:23.000,"Italy, which receives the most migrant arrivals in the European Union, is partially outsourcing the challenge from today, as it opens the first of two planned camps in neighbouring Albania. The centres will be used to house up to 3000 migrants per month rescued en route to Italy as part of Europe’s first ""offshoring"" scheme, while the continent grapples with how to respond to the challenge of irregular migration. The camp that opens today is located in the northern Albanian port of Shengjin. The opening of a second centre, on a former air force base in nearby Gjader, has been delayed. The structures will be entirely managed by the Italian government, which paid for their construction. They will be used for migrants picked up in international waters – though not women, children, or those deemed vulnerable. Once there, they will be allowed to request asylum in Italy. If refused, they will be sent back to countries deemed safe to return. “Italian and European legislation will be applied in these centres,"" Fabrizio Bucci, Italy’s ambassador in Albania, told me. “It’s like having a centre in Italy – but in Albania.” The agreement signed by the Italian and Albanian Prime Ministers will remain in place for five years – with the option to extend if it proves successful in reducing the migrant burden on Italy and deterring some from attempting to come. Arrivals in Italy by sea this year – around 31,000 so far – are down by more than half from the same period in 2023. Giorgia Meloni, the Italian Prime Minister, ran for office promising to clamp down hard on migration – and the Albania plan has become a key tenet of that. The hefty price tag, estimated at upwards of €650m (£547), is one of the criticisms levelled by Italian opposition politicians and human rights groups. “It’s an excessive cost to detain a limited number of migrants”, said Riccardo Magi, an MP with the left-wing +Europa party. When Ms Meloni recently visited the site in Albania, he approached her car to protest – and was grabbed by Albanian security officials. As she intervened, telling them to ease off, he shouted: “If they treat an elected MP like this, imagine how they’ll treat the migrants”. Speaking to the BBC, he compared the structures to a penal colony. He also doubted the ability of night-time rescuers to properly screen those picked up to ensure that no vulnerable individuals are sent to Albania. ""They won’t be able to delve deep into whether somebody has suffered torture or sexual violence or discrimination due to their sexuality back in Africa”, Mr Magi said. “It’s all an attempt at dissuasion and a PR show to tell Italians this is the first time a government can keep migrants out. But nobody who has risked their life to cross to Italy will be discouraged.” Fabrizio Bucci, the Italian ambassador in Tirana, disagrees. “It’s one of the elements that migrants and smugglers will have to factor in,"" he said. “What do we have to lose? We’ve been trying to redistribute migrants throughout the EU and it hasn’t worked. So why not try to chart a new way?” He refers to it as an experiment that, if successful, could be replicated. Indeed, 15 EU members, led by Denmark, recently wrote an open letter to the European Commission backing the outsourcing of migration. Sir Keir Starmer praised the Italy-Albania deal after meeting both Prime Ministers. It has drawn comparison with the plan of the previous Conservative government to deport failed asylum seekers from the United Kingdom to Rwanda – ditched by Mr Starmer. But the agreements are significantly different. While Rwanda would have managed the asylum requests and centres under its deal, giving successful claimants asylum there and deporting failed ones to third countries deemed safe by the Rwandan government, the Albania deal will be under Italian jurisdiction. “We made sure the Albanian legislation was already in full compliance with EU and international laws”, said Ambassador Bucci. For Albania, the reward is a boost to its image as it negotiates European Union membership. But Vladimir Karaj, a Tirana-based journalist with the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network, said it was a “complete surprise” when it was announced by the Prime Minister Edi Rama. Before the Rwanda deal was struck, there were reports that Britain was aiming for an agreement with Albania, which Mr Rama forcefully shot down. “He claimed he was strictly against this kind of treatment for refugees”, he said. “So when Albania struck the deal with Italy, there was huge speculation over what Rama was gaining personally."" Mr Karaj says there’s no ""smoking gun"": ""The government’s narrative is that Italy is our best friend and took in Albanians when our dictatorship fell in the 1990s.” The deal, Mr Karaj said, has been met only with short-lived protests by some claiming it was aimed at replacing Albanians with foreigners, or giving away territory to Italy. He suspects other countries may now come knocking on Albania’s door. “Albania needs the support it can get from the west”, he said. “If western governments like the UK or Germany see this is a solution, I don’t think Rama’s words about it just being for Italy will be that easy to sell.” The NCA says the boat continued its journey to the UK and arrived in Dover carrying about 40 people. Ms Meloni last year removed Italy from President Xi Jinping's signature Belt and Road Initiative. Michael Frison, from Chard, went missing in Sardinia on 13 July. The World Champion blamed ""losing too many kilos"" and ""irrepressible enthusiasm"" for the mishap. The bill will allow troops to open fire on migrants crossing the border when soldiers feel under threat. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

2,2024-08-01 14:31:43.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 12:31:38.000,"Sex, money, social media - how VP contenders are vetted",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv30gx7xkko,2024-07-31 15:09:34.000,"As Democratic presidential hopeful Kamala Harris vets potential running mates, spare a thought for the contenders as they undergo a process that one past participant likens to ""a colonoscopy performed with a telescope”. Have you ever paid for sex? Have you ever paid for an abortion? Have you ever had a homosexual encounter? This is just some of the material in questionnaires fired off during the exhaustive vetting process for previous US vice-presidential nominees. Potential partners to join Ms Harris on the Democratic ticket for November's election will have to answer up to 200 questions before they can even begin to be seriously considered. The vetters - campaign officials and lawyers who volunteer their billable hours for the networking and prestige - often have about a month to dig up every grain of dirt they can find. The Harris campaign has a matter of days to pick a running mate, with a paperwork deadline looming. The vice-president, who went through the process herself only four years ago, has been assessing around a dozen contenders, with Governor Josh Shapiro and Senator Mark Kelly among those being touted. Pete Buttigieg, who is also among the rumoured potential picks, was asked this week if the possible running mates are aware they are being vetted. ""Yeah, you know,"" he said with a smile. What makes the whole undertaking especially challenging is that, unlike with cabinet picks, the FBI does not perform background checks on vice-presidents. The vetters will pore over a contender’s tax returns and medical history. They may log on to his or her private social media accounts. They will scour the social media posts of his or her children. The grandchildren’s, too. The least suggestion of marital infidelity, or any other skeleton in the closet, will be picked apart. They will check every record of every word the potential candidate has ever uttered or written. Jim Hamilton, a Democratic lawyer who evaluated potential running mates for John Kerry, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, told the BBC that notes of the process are destroyed afterwards to preserve “a strict, strict veil of confidentiality”. He oversaw more than 200 lawyers who were tasked with finding Mrs Clinton’s running mate (she picked Virginia Senator Tim Kaine). “Everybody's got something in their background they’d just sooner not talk about,” Mr Hamilton said. “But you'd be surprised, once people commit to the process, at how candid they are in their answers.” Evan Bayh, a finalist to become Barack Obama’s running mate in 2008, remembers the procedure took nearly three months and was “like having a colonoscopy performed with a telescope”. “There was a whole team assigned to me: an accountant, a lawyer, a physician, you know,” the former Indiana senator and governor told the BBC. “They talked to my wife, they talked to my father.” Television crews were soon camped outside his house in Washington DC. Mr Bayh recalls his shock one morning as he sat down to breakfast with the television on and heard an MSNBC host remark that the senator’s bowl of yoghurt and granola “sure looks tasty”. The head of the vetting team phoned one day to ask Mr Bayh about a false internet rumour that he had once received psychiatric treatment. “And I said, ‘No, it's not true. But if you guys don't hurry up and make a decision, it might be true,’” he remembers joking. A list of 20 names was whittled away. Mr Bayh says it ultimately came down to himself and Joe Biden, then a Delaware senator. He recalls how he was flown out “very clandestinely” to St Louis, Missouri, in August that year to meet the future president in his hotel room. They spoke for around three hours. “There was about a three-foot high stack of materials there,” he recalls, ""that he [Mr Obama] just gestured to it, and he said, ‘I've gone over all the reports on you, and nothing in there bothers me.’ “He said, ‘But if there's anything that our team didn't discover, you should tell me now because it will come out.’ “And I said, ‘Well, your people did do a very thorough job. But there were probably two or three things I should mention to you.’ And I did. “And he looked at me, he said, ‘That's it?' And I said, 'Yeah, that's it.’ And he said, ‘Well, you haven't led very much of a life, have you?’” Mr Bayh did not elaborate to the BBC on his disclosures to Mr Obama in the hotel room, except to say they were family matters. Mr Biden was ultimately successful. Campaign manager David Plouffe later quoted President Obama as saying it was a “coin toss” between the two. Sometimes a vetter can pose a question that no-one else thought of, revealing a potential red flag, even if it’s not disqualifying. Gary Ginsberg, who worked for the Clinton campaign in ’92, told the BBC he remembers Al Gore at a loss for words when asked during the process if he had any friends. The reserved Tennessee senator bristled. But when pressed, he could name none, beyond his brother-in-law and two congressmen. Mr Gore’s lack of a social circle bothered one top campaign official. From a long-list of 50, he was nevertheless picked to be running mate. They won. Mr Gore, however, would struggle to overcome low personal likability ratings. The vetting process used to be largely informal and much less invasive, since it was seen as rude to ask a senator or governor about personal matters. Two selection disasters changed all that forever. In 1972, the Democratic White House nominee George McGovern dumped his running mate after just 18 days. He had picked Missouri Senator Thomas Eagleton based on a two-minute phone conversation and no background check. It almost immediately emerged in media reports that Mr Eagleton had received electroshock treatment in hospital for clinical depression a decade earlier. Nixon aides began asking reporters: “How could McGovern be trusted after putting a crazy man on the ticket?” In that November’s election, the Republican president annihilated his Democratic challenger. Vetters soon began to cast their nets wider, to look more closely at a potential running mate’s family members, after another embarrassment upended the 1984 White House race. Democratic nominee Walter Mondale needed a game-changer against Ronald Reagan that year, so he picked Geraldine Ferraro, the first female running mate ever on a major party national ticket. But the campaign was hamstrung by revelations about her real estate developer husband’s financial dealings. President Reagan went on to win 49 states in a landslide re-election. Sometimes a potential running mate dazzles at the audition, but fizzles on the political stage. In 2008, Republican presidential nominee John McCain’s campaign had just 72 hours to vet Sarah Palin. The then-44-year-old Alaska governor was asked by aides how she would react in a national security crisis where the president had been temporarily incapacitated by surgery. Under this scenario, the director of national intelligence comes to Acting-President Palin and tells her they have pinpointed Osama Bin Laden. A plane is overhead ready to kill the al-Qaeda leader. But there’ll be multiple civilian casualties. “Do you take the shot?” the vetter asked her. “Yes,” she said, “I would take the shot because I’m the President of the United States, this is our archenemy who took the lives of 3,000-plus Americans. And then I would get down on my knees and ask for forgiveness for the innocent souls whose lives I would be taking.” The vetters were highly impressed with this answer. Yet after she was unveiled as the vice-presidential nominee, Ms Palin proved unable to answer a reporter’s basic question about what newspapers she read. Soon she was seen as gaffe-prone and unready for the political primetime. Even when the vetting process is conducted with more rigour, the final decision is always up to the nominee. George HW Bush - one of the 15 US vice-presidents who became president- went with his gut when he picked little-known Indiana Senator Dan Quayle to be his running mate in 1988. Though they won, Mr Quayle, 41, was widely seen as more of a liability than an asset to the ticket, as recounted in the book First in Line, by Kate Andersen Brower. The vice-presidential nominee was asked by a reporter aboard the campaign plane in 1988: “What’s the favourite book that you’ve read?” Mr Quayle turned to his wife, Marilyn. “What’s the favourite book I’ve read?” he asked her, leaving a nearby political aide aghast.

2,2024-08-01 14:31:43.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 12:31:38.000,Kenya rolls out poison in bid to cull a million crows,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c999n2nyvwlo,2024-08-01 06:43:48.000,"""Invasive alien birds"" sounds like the strapline to a scary Hollywood blockbuster but for the people of coastal Kenya it is not a matter of fiction. The authorities there are so worried about the nuisance created by Indian house crows that they have begun the process of culling a million of them. They have not targeted humans, as in the Alfred Hitchock horror film The Birds, but these ones have for decades caused widespread disruption, by preying on wildlife, raiding tourist areas and attacking poultry farms. Poison is now being used in the towns of Watamu and Malindi to kill the first tranche of the ruthless sub-species. This ambitious poisoning campaign is aimed at halting the crows’ advance towards the capital, Nairobi. The birds, known on the coast as ""kunguru"" or ""kurabu"", originated from India and other parts of Asia, often spreading elsewhere by travelling on trading ships. But they are believed to have been intentionally introduced in East Africa around 1890s in a bid to tackle a mounting waste problem on the Zanzibar archipelago, then a British protectorate. From there, they spread to the mainland and up the coast to Kenya. They were first recorded in the port of Mombasa in 1947 and since then, their numbers have exploded, thanks to the growing human population and the accompanying mounds of rubbish, which provide an ideal environment for the birds to feed and breed. They also have no natural predators. The Indian house crows, considered one of the world’s most invasive and destructive birds, have continued their northward journey. ""They prey on the indigenous species, not just birds but also mammals, reptiles - and so their impact on biodiversity is devastating,"" Jaap Gijsbertsen, a Dutch bird expert, who is visiting Kenya's Watamu area, told the BBC. Conservationists say that the crows have significantly reduced the number of small indigenous birds in the region, such as weavers and waxbills, by ripping their nests apart while targeting eggs and even chicks. ""When the population of local birds declines, the environment begins to suffer. There will be a possible increase of harmful pests and insects that the birds prey on,"" Lennox Kirao, a research scientist with conservation group A Rocha Kenya, said. They also damage crops, livestock and chickens. ""They pounce on chicks and eat them like madmen. These are not normal birds, they act wildly,"" said Eunice Katana, a resident of Takaye village in Kilifi county. They are also known to use a unique sound to communicate distress - or when they spot a prey, according to Mr Kirao. The birds have defaced houses in Mombasa by defecating on the walls and roofs, while many people shy away from sitting under tree shades for fear of being dirtied by their droppings. ""These crows rise early and interrupt our sleep with their annoying squeals and cawing,"" Mombasa resident Victor Kimuli told the BBC. Given all these issues the authorities felt they had to act and aim to halve the Indian house crow population through poisoning, which began on Tuesday. This follows months of consultations with environmental experts, conservationists, community leaders and representatives from the hotel industry, the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) said. ""We are trying to get their population down to a controllable number,"" said Mr Kirao. The culling process involves months of pre-baiting - where the birds are encouraged, through leaving meat out, to gather at various places near their roost sites. ""We then poison them after pulling together the highest number in the baiting sites,"" Eric Kinoti, an official from the A Rocha Kenya, said. An avian poison called Starlicide is so far the only known substance that has proved effective in reducing crow numbers, without affecting other birds or animals. Close to 2,000 crows were killed in 2022 during efficacy tests carried out on the poison by Little Kenya Gardens, the company licensed to import the poison, Cecilia Ruto, owner of the firm, said. ""The slow-acting poison is entirely metabolised by the crow before it dies – which means, there is little risk of secondary poisoning to any other species that feeds on the dead crow,"" Ms Ruto added. There are currently 2kg (4.4lb) of the poison in the country which is estimated to be able to kill about 20,000 crows in the ongoing eradication. But there are plans to import more from New Zealand. Its use in Kenya has, however, raised ethical concerns from animal and bird rights activists, who argue that poisoning the crows is inhumane and that alternative and non-lethal methods should be explored. “Mass poisoning is a short-term solution that does not address the root cause of the problem,” said Leonard Onyango, an environmentalist. “There is a need to look at sustainable, humane approaches to manage the crow population,” he added. But those involved in the programme emphasise the need to protect native species and ensure ecological balance. “If we do nothing now, the damage could become irreversible,” said Mr Kirao, who is involved in the culling programme. This is not the first time the government has initiated plans to control invasive bird species. The previous attempt more than 20 years ago reduced the bird population, but the government later banned the importation of Starlicide in an effort to regulate what was coming into the country. Apart from dump sites, tourist hotels have become the crows’ favourite haunt, where they flock dining areas, disrupting guests as they enjoy their meals, hotel owners have complained. “The crows have really become a big bother to guests who visit our hotels to enjoy their meals outside the tropical beaches,"" Maureen Awuor, the Kenya Association of Hotelkeepers and Caterers chairperson, said. Some hotels trap and suffocate the crows, while others have hired staff with catapults to scare them. But trapping is said to be ineffective as the birds are intelligent enough to avoid areas where they witness other crows dying or being trapped. Despite the huge numbers which are planned to be culled, the authorities feel that they have no choice, especially now that there are concerns that the crows could spread inland. The birds have been spotted in the Mtito Andei area - about 240km (150 miles) from the capital, Nairobi, conservationists say. ""My biggest fear is, if we don't do anything now, the crows will reach Nairobi. This will pose a great threat to birdlife in the country, especially at the Nairobi National Park,"" Mr Kirao said.

2,2024-08-01 14:31:43.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 12:31:38.000,"50 jobs, 30 years: The unseen labour of an Indian female worker",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ck7g9kjdrpmo,2024-07-31 23:55:23.000,"Syeda X, a poor migrant woman living in shanty towns that skirt India’s capital Delhi, struggled through more than 50 jobs in 30 years. She trimmed jeans threads, cooked savouries, shelled almonds and made tea strainers, door knobs, photo frames and toy guns. She also stitched school bags and did bead and jewellery work. Despite her hard work, she earned meagre wages, like 25 rupees (30 cents; 23 pence) for assembling 1,000 toy guns. The protagonist of a new book, The Many Lives of Syeda X, by journalist Neha Dixit, Syeda relocated to Delhi with her family in the mid-1990s after religious riots in the neighbouring state of Uttar Pradesh. Reported over 10 years with more than 900 interviews, the book highlights, in part, the precarious life of an Indian home-based female worker. Ms Dixit’s book shines a spotlight on the invisible lives of India’s neglected female home-based workers. After being recognised officially as a distinct category of workers only in 2007, India defined a home-based worker as someone who produces goods or services for an employer from their own home or chosen premises, regardless of whether the employer provides equipment or materials. Over 80% of working women in India are employed in the informal economy, with home-based work being the largest sector after agriculture. Yet, no legislation or policy supports these women. Wiego, an organisation that supports women in informal employment, estimated that by 2017-18, women comprised about 17 million of the 41 million home-based workers in India. These women represented approximately 9% of total employment. Their numbers in the city have grown faster than in India’s countryside. “The centre of gravity in home-based workers appears to be shifting to urban areas,” says Indrani Mazumdar, a historian who has worked extensively on the subject. Bereft of social security or any protection, these women are in a constant battle with poverty, precariousness and wayward spouses. Often their family’s main breadwinners, they strive to earn enough to educate their children out of poverty. These women also face the brunt of climate change, losing livelihoods and running losses: monsoon waterlogging in their homes leads to wastage of their supplied material. In India, around 75% of female workers in manufacturing work are home-based, says economist Sona Mitra. “These women are recorded as self-employed and they are largely invisible,” she adds. Ms Dixit’s harrowing narrative portrays Syeda X and other home-based working women as archetypes of helplessness and exploitation. No-one knows who sets the abysmal rates for their work. No-one provides instructions, training, or tools. These women rely solely on each other to learn how to get the job done. Finding work is also often about following the news cycle, Ms Dixit writes. When Kalpana Chawla became the first Indian-origin woman in space in 1997, women dressed plastic dolls in hand-stitched white spacesuits. During the 1999 cricket World Cup, they stitched hundreds of cheap footballs. A viral 2001 rumour about a “monkey man” attacking people in Delhi spurred a demand for masks resembling the creature to be sold at traffic crossings. During elections, they made flags, key rings and caps for political parties. When schools resumed, they packed crayons and school bags and bound books. Many women also find it difficult to get home-based work for more than 20 days a month. Ms Dixit writes that only those who don't negotiate rates or ask too many questions, buy their own tools, deliver on time, never ask for advances or help during crises and tolerate delayed payments are able to find work easily. The precarity of female home workers has increased due to changes in the nature of the work, according to Ms Mazumdar. Up until the 1990s, the readymade garment industry outsourced many tasks to home workers. This shifted in the 1990s as factories began bringing tasks in-house and machines replaced human labour, particularly for embroidery. ""Home-based work became very volatile,"" she says. In 2019, the International Labour Organisation, drawing on household surveys in 118 countries, estimated there were around 260 million home-based workers worldwide, representing 7.9% of the global employment. Research from Brazil and South Africa shows that monitoring work conditions and protecting workers' rights in subcontracted or home-based work is possible when local governments and trade unions collaborate effectively. Such examples in India are few and far between. There's the 52-year-old Self Employed Women’s Association (Sewa), a membership-based organisation that unites poor, self-employed women in the informal economy. There are self-help groups of home-based workers and micro-finance to support them. ""But these schemes have really not helped them when it comes to employment,"" says Ms Mazumdar. In 2009, women in Delhi who shelled and cleaned almonds from homes stopped working, demanding better pay and overtime, among other things. (They were paid 50 rupees for cleaning a 23kg bag for 12-16 hours.) The strike paralysed the almond processing industry at its peak season. A study in Tamil Nadu state by social scientist K Kalpana illustrated how home and neighbourhood-based female workers subcontracted to make appalams (papadum) in Chennai successfully defended their rights, despite government agencies ignoring claims of trade unions. Syeda X and her friends had no such luck. “If she ever took time off to nurse an illness or to attend to her children, her job would be lost to another faceless migrant, fighting to take her place,” writes Ms Dixit. Displacement and hardship were the only constants in her life, shifting from job to job and home to home. Follow BBC India on YouTube, Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

2,2024-08-01 14:31:43.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 12:31:38.000,Video games strike rumbles on in row over AI,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czvxz11gl57o,2024-07-31 23:46:32.000,"Actors from the world of gaming went on strike last week, in a row about the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and the threat it poses to their livelihoods. It has reignited the debate about how the entertainment industry is adapting to new technology. When actor Jennifer Hale talks, you listen. Her delivery is measured and surgically precise, yet her tone has a warmth that most ASMR creators would envy. She could read the phone book and you’d pay attention. It’s unsurprising, then, that her voice is her livelihood, and that she takes the threat to her industry posed by AI so seriously. “They see that the work of our souls is nothing more than a commodity to generate profits for them,"" she says of several of the major gaming companies. ""They don't see that they're crushing human beings beneath their feet in blind pursuit of money and profit, it's disgusting."" From Commander Shepard in the Mass Effect series to Samus Aran in the Metroid titles, Hale’s list of gaming credits is as long as your arm and her voice is familiar to millions. Hale is one of the most high-profile voice actors in the world. She’s joined 2,500 members of the US actors union SAG-AFTRA who perform in games, by striking until games divisions of prominent companies like Activision, Warner Brothers, Walt Disney and EA agree to protections around the use of artificial intelligence (AI). She tells BBC News: “They could, for example, take all my performances in a game, let's say Mass Effect, feed them into a machine, not too long down the timeline, spit out an entirely new Mass Effect, with a performance that was entirely generated by AI.” Concerns about AI were one of the key issues in last year’s 118-day actors strike organised by SAG-AFTRA. Terms were eventually agreed with Hollywood studios for film and TV actors. But the dispute around videogames has rumbled on, finally boiling over into a strike on 25 July. While both sides have agreed on a host of issues, AI protections remains a sticking point. Hale may be one of the most successful voice actors in the business but in contrast to those who work in front of the camera and despite the games industry generating revenue estimated to be around $189bn (£147bn) in 2024, voice acting in games is considerably less well paid than film and TV work. “I’m a single working mother who has bills to pay and a life to provide for my kid, as voice actors we don't get paid star salaries. Under what they're proposing on the other side of this contract, they would pay me nothing.” Audrey Cooling, a representative of the 10 game companies negotiating with the union, told BBC News: ""Our offer is directly responsive to SAG-AFTRA’s concerns and extends meaningful AI protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers working under the IMA [Interactive Media Agreement]."" This is an ongoing deal to cover artists working in video games. Hale argues not all games companies are the problem, some businesses can and are making deals which work for all sides. “Anybody sitting in their basement, anywhere making a game can go to SAG and say, hey, my budget is small, I only have this much money. I really want to work with these good actors. What can I do in SAG will say, absolutely, here you go, how big are you? Great here's your structure."" She adds this strike might be a symptom of a growing unease in the wider workplace with AI. “We actors are the canary in the coal mine. You can see them coming for us, but if they dismiss it, if it gets swept under the rug because we're just performers, what does that mean?” On the other side of the Atlantic, John Barclay, assistant general secretary of the UK actor’s union Equity, released a statement of solidarity with its stateside counterparts. “We stand shoulder to shoulder with SAG-AFTRA as partners in a global fight to secure fair pay and protect our members’ rights, which could not be more urgent as we move forward with artificial intelligence innovation.” Regulations around strikes are different in the UK, Equity members aren’t striking and neither will UK members of SAG-AFTRA be compelled to. Actor David Menkin has provided the voice for Luke Skywalker in Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, as well as voice work in Final Fantasy XVI and Horizon Zero Dawn, amongst a host of other games. He explains: “Here in the UK, we don't have a mutually agreed contract between the union Equity and the producers that make these games. So therefore, even if you're SAG-AFTRA but you were hired on a UK based contract, you can't stop, you cannot strike, you cannot leave the production, you have to fulfil everything in your contract.” He tells me he’ s concerned that US companies may try and work around the issue of striking American actors by coming to the UK and hiring British talent to perform in games instead. “All we can do is make sure that if the work is dumped in the UK, that we are making sure that UK-based actors are fully informed.” In the US the strike continues and while she waits for both sides to return to the negotiating table, Jennifer Hale hopes long time creative concerns will overcome short-term commercial gain. “I hope they see that we are all in this together. I don't understand why they're willing to kill us all off to increase things a few percentage points, it makes no sense to me.""

2,2024-08-01 14:31:43.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 12:31:38.000,How a refugee Olympian found a new life in Canada,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crg4vr7kyq5o,2024-07-31 23:07:53.000,"Nigara Shaheen’s journey to becoming an Olympic judoka did not begin with judo. Instead, it began with a 30-minute karate lesson on her family’s balcony in Peshawar, Pakistan. She was 11 years old and had already been a refugee for most of her young life, having fled her native Afghanistan in 1993 with her parents as an infant, her mother carrying her as they walked two days and nights through the mountains to safety. She has faced many more obstacles to fight in the sport she loves, in between her first-ever karate lesson and competing in the Paris Olympics as part of the Refugee Olympic Team. Since 2022, the 31-year-old athlete has been living and training in Toronto. As a young student in Pakistan, Ms Shaheen faced harassment by older men on her way to the refugee school she attended, and bullying by her peers. In an essay in the Toronto Life magazine, she recalled: ""One day, an older man assaulted me and my sister. He screamed at us and pushed me to the ground. I wanted to punch and beat him, but I didn’t know how."" Her mother said she needed to learn how to defend herself. The school she attended didn't offer martial arts or other after-school activities for students - even if it had, it would often close, sometimes for weeks at a time, she told the BBC in an interview from Paris. But through her extended family, she heard about an instructor who was coaching karate at a nearby school. He couldn't train her there, but he could come to her. Soon after, Ms Shaheen was on the balcony at her aunt's home, getting coached. Her mother told her the balcony was all the family had to offer “but you can use it as much as you want”, she recalled. Not long after, Ms Shaheen was fighting in local karate tournaments. Her coach, noticing her talent and passion, suggested she try competing in judo. “I asked him ‘what’s judo? And how would I know what to do?’ He told me: ‘Just grab your opponent and throw her, that’s it,’” she said. Ms Shaheen was able to take down her first opponent in a few seconds. She had a knack for the sport. While winning felt good, it was the philosophy of judo that got her hooked. “(My first coach) said you will not learn how to get up unless you fall. As a kid, that really motivated me,” she said. It also reminded her of watching the WWE with her father, a wrestling fan, as a child. The sport gave her the confidence to find herself - and joy in her life - despite the hardships she faced as a refugee. Ms Shaheen’s coaches began to notice her talent. At one point she trained with Pakistan’s national judo team but could not compete alongside them without a Pakistani passport. In 2014, Ms Shaheen returned to Afghanistan, where she studied political science and public administration at the American University in Kabul. She also trained with the Afghani national team, were she was welcomed by her male colleagues. ""Inside the gym, we were a family, and they treated me like I was their sister,"" she wrote in Toronto Life. She continued to train and compete, and began to receive a lot of attention as a female athlete in Afghanistan - some of it unwanted. “I faced immense cyber bullying,” she told the BBC. The harassment later turned physical. “There were so many times when cars would chase us,” she said. Once, someone threw a soft drink can in her mother’s direction as she was dropping her off at practice. She left her home country again, in 2018. “I always say that I became a refugee for a second time,” she said. She moved to Russia for her master’s studies in international trade and entrepreneurship. But unlike the welcome she received at her gym in Afghanistan, she couldn't find a training partner in Russia. She spent the next year training alone - a time she has called ""the worst days"" of her career. In 2019, she was approached by an International Judo Federation member, who suggested she try out for the Refugee Olympic Team. She qualified for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, but a serious shoulder injury knocked her out of the competition. By then she had finished her studies in Russia and the situation in Afghanistan had deteriorated drastically. “I was just stuck,” Ms Shaheen said. She returned to Pakistan where she mostly stayed at home in fear of her safety - she had faced criticism for not wearing a headscarf during the Games - and contemplated her next steps. That’s when the opportunity to live and train in Canada opened up, with the help of the Olympic Refugee Foundation and United Nations Refugee Agency. Ms Shaheen was accepted to study in Toronto for a postgraduate degree in international development. She arrived in September 2022 - a bittersweet moment for the athlete who had already journeyed through three countries in search of stability. It was in that Canadian city where her judo career was given a new lease on life. “I was so happy to finally be at a place where I can be myself,” she said. “But it was also hard for me because I had to say goodbye to my parents for the second time.” In Paris, she is one of the 37 athletes playing for the Refugee Olympic Team - a team Ms Shaheen is grateful to be a part of. “I feel really proud,” she said ahead of her first competition on Tuesday against Mexico’s Prisca Awiti Alcaraz. “I’m as much of an Afghan as I am a refugee,” she said. The banner for the refugee team is “a flag that I can relate to”. While she lost to Ms Alcaraz, Ms Shaheen has said that she is thankful to be able to compete at the highest level. ""Even with every loss, I learn something new."" She will appear on the mat once again on Saturday, where she will represent the Refugee Olympic Team in the mixed team event - her first time doing so. ""Team events are more exciting since I always look at my teammates and feel like I can’t let them down so I fight for all of them,"" she told the International Judo Federation ahead of the competition. After the games, Ms Shaheen plans to call Canada home - she is now a permanent resident - and she hopes to one day work to assist refugees like herself. Her parents are still in Pakistan, where they are cheering her on as she lives out her Olympic dream. At her lowest points, she said she would lean on her family for support. “My sister used to tell me, ‘I trust that one day you will achieve something big, and this will be a memory and you will laugh about this.’” “Now is the time that I laugh about it.” Who is representing Great Britain at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris? Rower Philip Doyle says the feeling of winning an Olympic bronze medal alongside Daire Lynch in the men's pair is ""phenomenal"".

2,2024-08-01 14:31:43.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 12:31:38.000,Can technology fix the 'broken' concert ticketing system?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cml2p8nvzp9o,2024-07-31 23:05:57.000,"For Nashville native Jacki Thrapp flying to Europe this summer to see her idol Taylor Swift perform live was a “no brainer”. With the cheapest tickets for the remaining US dates of Swift’s continuing Eras Tour now costing $2,500 (£2,000) on the resale market, up from their face value of $49, some American fans realised that it would be cheaper for them to fly across the Atlantic to catch one of the European shows instead. So back in May, Jacki went to see Swift perform twice in Sweden, with each ticket costing her less than $200. “Americans are paying so much money, and a lot of Taylor Swift fans are people in their 20s and 30s,” says the 32-year-old. “We're paying so much money to see her in the US when a lot of us still can't even afford a house.” Although Jacki bought two Swedish tickets on the secondary market, the mark-up of the most expensive was only around double its face value. This is said to be because buying resold tickets is not an established thing to do in Sweden, unlike in the US and UK. In other European countries, such as Germany, tickets cannot be resold at more than 25% above their face value. Meanwhile, some nations go even further. Italy, Portugal and the Republic of Ireland all have laws in place that prevent concert tickets being sold above their original price. In the UK and the US the price of re-sold tickets can currently be as high as people are willing to pay. In April, 250 musical artists, including Billie Eilish and Cyndi Lauper, signed an open letter that attacked ""predatory resellers"", and called the current ticking system ""broken"". The situation may change for the better in the UK in the next few years, as the Labour Party, which forms the new government, said in March that it planned to cap the resale price of tickets. Yet laws preventing excessive pricing on the secondary market do not stop two key issues – touts getting their hands on excessive amounts of tickets in the first instance, and the risk of people buying counterfeit tickets or being scammed. The latter is said to have affected hundreds of Taylor Swift fans who tried to buy tickets for her concerts in the UK this summer. Asher Weiss, chief executive of ticketing start-up Tixologi, believes that technology is the solution, particularly AI. “People [touts] will buy a ticket and list it on multiple marketplaces for secondary sale,” he says. “And then even if it sells on one, they won't take it down off the other one. “So multiple people end up with the same ticket, trying to get in,” explains Mr Weiss, whose firm is based in Los Angeles. To prevent people buying excessive numbers of tickets, he says that Tixologi’s AI “will be able to flag people making multiple purchases from the same IP address as unusual purchasing behaviour”. “That would prevent those bad actors, and protect the true fans and customers,” adds Mr Weiss. His firm is also able to ensure that only one copy of a ticket can ever exist. It does this by using blockchain, the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies. This prevents duplication. Tixologi’s electronic tickets also have a rotating QR code that is said to be extremely difficult to copy, so that fake ones are instantly spotted when scanned. And a venue or artist can select a function called “disable transfers”, which prevents a user from emailing the ticket to someone else. This makes them much harder to re-sell. UK ticketing company Seat Unique is working with London’s Wembley Stadium to sell hospitality tickets for Taylor Swift’s tour. She returns to the stadium for five shows in August, following three there in June. “It is probably the most popular event I’ve seen in 15 years,” says Robin Sherry, Seat Unique’s founder and chief executive. The company specializes in allowing venues and artists to sell their tickets via dynamic pricing. What this means is that the price is allowed to go up, and down, according to demand. The idea is that the venue and artists sell the tickets directly, and therefore get the additional income if prices rise, instead of that money going to sellers on the secondary market. To set the dynamic price Seat Unique is now using AI to constantly monitor demand and automatically respond to it. “It’s ultimately about keeping tickets in the hands of fans not scalpers,” says Mr Sherry, who also works with sports clubs and organisations. He adds that AI also has the ability to transform the marketing of concerts and other events, with adverts specifically targeted at individuals based on learning what they are interested in. “I always jokingly say, AI will know what events you want to go to before I do,” he adds, saying that this will be “revolutionary in an industry that has been slow to modernise”. While AI is starting to change how we are able buy tickets to concerts and other events, it is also beginning to appear on the stage. In November a new AI-powered hologram of Elvis Presley will be performing live in London. The creator of the Elvis Evolution production, Andrew McGuiness, says the hologram is so lifelike that it will be “less like Abba Voyage and more like time travel”. But whether AI will be the answer for fans like Jacki Thrapp remains to be seen. ""This was the first time I've ever left America to see one of my favourite artists, but there has to be a better way to do this,” she says. Both Seat Unique and Tixologi hope that better way will be delivered by advances in AI. A faulty update by the cyber-security firm last month caused chaos around the world. The two companies say they will offer drivers financial incentives to switch to electric cars. Sales of Instagram and Facebook adverts have soared, delivering a surge in profits for parent company Meta. The central bank has put up its key rate to ""around 0.25%"" as it tries to ease rising prices. Singapore officials say they are investigating the incident, which hospitalised 57 people.

2,2024-08-01 14:31:43.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 12:31:38.000,The Mexican women aiding migrants on their perilous journey north,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c720vye08y9o,2024-08-01 00:21:25.000,"Few people know how perilous the migrant journey across Mexico has become in recent months better than a group of women in the eastern state of Veracruz, known as Las Patronas. For the past 30 years, as policies towards Central American migrants have hardened on both sides of the Rio Grande, they have unfailingly kept up the same humanitarian gesture to the migrants who pass through their village. Every day, Las Patronas bag up rice, beans, tortillas, bread, tins of tuna and bottles of water. As the freight train known as La Bestia, meaning The Beast, approaches, they scramble to the side of the tracks and hold out the food for the migrants travelling on its roofs to grab as they thunder past. “Gracias! God bless you!” the migrants yell over the deafening noise of the train as it clatters north, a fleeting moment of kindness on what is one of the most dangerous migrant journeys in the world. Many will struggle to make it much further north. This year, Mexico has stopped around three times as many migrants who have crossed into its territory from Central America as it did a year ago. While the 280,000 interdictions a month by the Mexican authorities have won approval in Washington, they have made life unbearable for those on the road. “The dream that many call the American Dream has turned into a nightmare”, reflects Norma Romero, the founder of Las Patronas. Mexico and the United States are at a pivotal point in their relationship. Mexico has just chosen its first woman president, Claudia Sheinbaum, who will take office in October. The United States, meanwhile, is heading full steam into its election campaign with possibly its first female president in Kamala Harris, or a second Trump presidency on the horizon. Neither scenario gives Norma much cause for optimism. “I never put my faith in politics. Rather, I believe in ordinary people who bring about change and who have different ways of thinking,” she says, as her fellow volunteers chop vegetables to flavour the rice. Nor does she think having a woman at the helm will make any difference in terms of tackling the widespread abuses of migrants in Mexico. “Sadly, politics hasn't improved since, well, as long as I can remember. Really, there’s never been any change that has brought any benefit to migrants.” I first met Norma a decade ago when, as she showed the BBC, the freight trains were heaving with migrants fleeing violence and hardship in their home countries for the prospect of a better life in the United States. Successive Mexican governments tended not to stop people heading north if they were simply passing through. In the United States, undocumented immigration was not the polarising electoral topic that it has since become. Today, that attitude has noticeably changed. Particularly in US border states, it is the leading issue heading into November’s vote. In June, President Joe Biden issued an executive order which grants US Border Patrol the right to deport people who have crossed into the US illegally without processing their asylum-requests. In the first four weeks of the new policy, there was a 40% reduction in detentions on the US southern border. Norma says Las Patronas have seen noticeably emptier trains in recent weeks – sometimes without any migrants on them at all. She thinks the migrants are using other routes, by bus or on foot. But, she says, they remain woefully uninformed about such US policy developments or the extent of the obstacles they face on the road: “The migrants don't have the basic knowledge they need about what is involved in travelling through Mexico,” she laments. “We see what’s happening to them and try to think about their wellbeing as human beings.” Las Patronas also run a shelter where weary migrants can get a hot meal, a bed, bathe, wash their clothes and receive medical attention. Among those staying for a few days to rest and gather their strength is Guadalupe, a Salvadoran migrant travelling with her 17-year-old daughter Nicole. She says they won’t travel on La Bestia again, having twice been taken off the freight train by immigration officers. The experience, she recalls, was brutal. “They hit a lot of people who were with us and gave others electric shocks with tasers. They almost tasered me too. That was the worst experience we’ve had here in Mexico.” Given the threat of kidnappings, sexual abuse and extortion by the country’s drug cartels, traversing Mexico is one of the most fraught parts of a journey which, for some, began in the Andes or the Caribbean. Often though, says Guadalupe, they’re extorted by migration and security officials, the very men and women charged with upholding the law in Mexico. “Once they take us off the train, many migration officers demand bribes from us. If we have enough money, we can pass. This time, we didn’t, and they sent us back to the border with Guatemala. That was the hardest thing.” Mexican law enforcement has undoubtedly kept down the numbers of migrants reaching the US’s door. “There is no crisis in migration at present,” said Mexico's President, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, recently as he urged the US to bolster development aid to Central America to dissuade people from leaving home in the first place. Rather than outright deportations – Mexico only sent back around 8,500 people in the first three months of this year – the Mexican authorities have been employing a form of ‘internal removal’ instead. Thousands of detained migrants have been dropped in towns on the border with Guatemala, some 2,000 kilometres from the US border. The strategy saps the migrants of the funds and energy they need to keep going. Salvadoran migrant, Guadalupe, likens the tactic to a giant game of snakes and ladders: “It’s very similar. Just like the board game, you have to avoid stepping on the snakes or you’re back to square one. It’s the same here too. If we don’t hide or run faster than the immigration agents, then our journey ends and we’re sent all the way back to the start.” The BBC repeatedly requested an interview with the Mexican government over undocumented immigration, but no-one was made available. As another train approaches, Guadalupe helps Norma Romero and the other women to take the food down to the tracks. No matter who wins in the US, or what their relationship with President-elect Sheinbaum, Norma says Las Patronas won’t turn off their stoves as long as migrants keep coming past.

2,2024-08-01 15:05:46.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 13:05:36.000,"Hamas military chief was killed in July strike, Israel says",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv3gpy74ydo,2024-08-01 12:08:52.000,"Israel's military says it has confirmed that Hamas's military chief Mohammed Deif was killed in an Israeli air strike in the Gaza Strip last month. Deif was targeted in the strike on a compound in the Khan Younis area on 13 July. Hamas is yet to confirm his death. Israel says Deif was one of the figures responsible for planning the 7 October attacks in southern Israel in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. On Wednesday, Hamas political leader Ismael Haniyeh was killed during a visit to Iran. Israel has not commented on his death directly. In a statement on Thursday, the Israeli military said that ""following an intelligence assessment, it can be confirmed that Mohammed Deif was eliminated"" in the 13 July strike. Gaza’s Hamas-run health authorities said at the time that the air strike had killed more than 90 people, but denied that Deif was among the dead. Deif was widely seen as the second-ranking Hamas official in Gaza, behind Yahya Sinwar, the group's leader in the territory. Israel’s Defence Minister, Yoav Gallant, said the death of Deif is “a significant milestone” in the dismantling of Hamas. ""This operation reflects the fact that Hamas is disintegrating, and that Hamas terrorists may either surrender or they will be eliminated,"" he added. Mohammed Deif was appointed head of the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the military arm of the Hamas movement, in 2002. For decades he's been seen as one of Israel's most wanted men - and survived a reported seven assassination attempts. Reports in Israeli and Palestinian media say that Deif was born in Gaza's Khan Yunis refugee camp in 1965, when the territory was occupied by Egypt. As a young man in the 1980s, he joined Hamas and quickly rose to prominence. Israel accused him of planning and supervising bus bombings which killed tens of Israelis in 1996, and of involvement in the capture and killing of three Israeli soldiers in the mid-1990s.  Deif is also known to have helped engineer the construction of tunnels that have allowed Hamas fighters to enter Israel from Gaza. In 2014, Israel attempted to kill Deif with an air strike on a house in the Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood of Gaza, which killed Deif's wife, Widad, and their infant son, Ali. Israel thought it had killed Deif, too, but he was not in the building at the time. During the current conflict, Deif is believed to have directed Hamas' military operations from within underground tunnels inside Gaza.  Israel's confirmation of Deif's death comes at the end of a turbulent week in the Israel-Gaza conflict, which has stoked fears of a broader regional war. On Saturday, 12 Israeli children and young people were killed after a rocket fell on a football field in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed Lebanon-based Hezbollah, saying they would pay ""a heavy price"". On Tuesday, Israel retorted with air strike on Beirut which killed senior Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr, as well as four others, including two children. Hours later, Hamas’s political leader Ismael Haniyeh was killed in a strike on a building he was staying in during a visit to Iran’s capital, Tehran. Benjamin Netanyahu warned Israel that ""challenging days lies ahead"" after Iran threatened ""harsh punishment"". The Hamas leader was assassinated in Tehran, and it is widely believed Israel was behind the killing. Widely considered the group's overall leader, Haniyeh had been a prominent member since the late 1980s. Ismail Haniyeh was elected head of Hamas's political bureau in 2017. As Hamas's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh was a key interlocutor in the Gaza ceasefire negotiations. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, led prayers for the Hamas leader, whose body will be buried in Qatar. US media have quoted Iranian officials as saying the supreme leader has ordered a direct attack against Israel, which it says was responsible for the attack on Iranian soil. Israel has not commented on the assassination directly. However, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country had delivered “crushing blows” to its enemies in recent days, including the killing of a senior Hezbollah commander in Lebanon hours before the Tehran strike. He warned Israelis that “challenging days lie ahead”, as fears of a wider conflict in the Middle East grow. ""Since the strike in Beirut, we have heard threats from all sides,"" he told a televised address. ""We are prepared for any scenario and we will stand united and determined."" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned against a ""dangerous escalation"" of hostilities in the region. Hamas's armed wing said the death of Haniyeh, who was widely viewed as the group's overall leader, would ""take the battle to new dimensions"" and have major repercussions. While Haniyeh's funeral was still taking place, Israel's military said it had confirmed that Hamas's military chief, Mohammed Deif, was killed in an air strike in the Gaza Strip last month. Deif was targeted in the strike on a compound in the Khan Younis area on 13 July. Hamas is yet to confirm his death. Israel says Deif was one of the figures responsible for planning the 7 October attacks in southern Israel in which 1,200 people were killed. Since the attack, Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas. Haniyeh, who played an important role in negotiations over a ceasefire in Gaza, was killed hours after attending the inauguration of Iran's new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, in Tehran. A senior Hamas official told the BBC the killing took place in the same building where Haniyeh had stayed during previous visits to Iran. Three Hamas leaders and a number of guards were with him in the same building, they said. Khalil Al-Hayya, a senior Hamas official, told a news conference that a missile hit Haniyeh ""directly"", citing witnesses who were with him. The group's leadership has been left in ""a state of shock"", top Hamas officials have told the BBC. Hours before Haniyeh was targeted, Israel said it had killed senior Hezbollah leader Fuad Shukr in Beirut. Israel believes he was responsible for a rocket attack that killed 12 people in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Saturday. Hezbollah has denied any involvement. The Iran-backed group confirmed Shukr's body was found among the rubble of the residential building which was struck. Four other people, including two children, were killed. Benjamin Netanyahu warned Israel that ""challenging days lies ahead"" after Iran threatened ""harsh punishment"". Israel had accused Fuad Shukr, a top Hezbollah commanders, of masterminding operations against Israel. The Hamas leader was assassinated in Tehran, and it is widely believed Israel was behind the killing. Iran says it will avenge the killing of Hamas's Ismail Haniyeh - but what will that mean in practice? The UN said a ""staggering number"" of Palestinians have been detained by Israel, with many facing torture and abuse. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

2,2024-08-01 15:05:46.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 13:05:36.000,Bowen: Israel's killing of Haniyeh deals hammer blow to ceasefire prospects,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp4wgqypwrxo,2024-07-31 19:04:05.000,"Israel has inflicted two devastating blows on its enemies. It has not confirmed that it killed the Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, but it is hard to see who else would have wanted him dead more than the Israelis. As for the Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr, Israel says he was killed in Beirut in an “intelligence-based elimination”. For Israel, everyone senior in Hamas is a legitimate target after the attacks of 7 October 2023, which inflicted the worst single day of bloodshed on Israel since independence in 1948. Fuad Shukr, Israel says, was killed because as a veteran Hezbollah commander he was responsible for the rocket attack that killed 12 children and young people in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Hezbollah has confirmed he was killed in the raid on Beirut. It denies carrying out the attack in the Golan. Once again, the Middle East is full of speculation that the all-out war feared since 7 October is imminent. The deadly irony is no side wants that war, but increasingly they are prepared to risk it. The Israelis have been under pressure from their American allies to calibrate their response to Hezbollah, inflicting a blow that will hurt the group without provoking a devastating retaliation and igniting a wider and deeper war. But two assassinations amount to a major gamble. The leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, might still decide that an attack on their stronghold in southern Beirut warrants a matching attack on Tel Aviv. Israel might also have calculated that Iran would not go to war over an assassinated Palestinian leader, even though his death in their capital, under their protection, is a humiliation. Killing Haniyeh, just after he had met the new Iranian president, is a dramatic display of Israel’s reach. The Islamic Republic thought it re-established deterrence when it fired hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel in April - that claim has now been exposed as hollow. April’s barrage was also retaliation, for the Israeli air strike that killed two Iranian generals in Iran’s embassy in Damascus. More retaliation looks certain from Iran, its ally Hezbollah or one of its proxies. Pro-Iranian militias in Iraq have made it clear that they blame the US equally for what has happened. In the Red Sea, the Houthis might redouble their attacks out of Yemen. There are limits to what Hamas can do, after months of the Israeli onslaught in Gaza. But the Israelis are on high alert for attacks in the occupied West Bank or inside Israel itself. It is important to realise that the Middle East is already in a regional war, but also to recognise that it could get much worse. Even so, this round of killing and retaliation might not be the spark that ignites all-out war, though it is easy to construct scenarios based on the clear and dangerous risks and realities in the world’s most turbulent region. Pulling back from the brink, repeatedly, is not making war any less likely. It makes it harder to construct a diplomatic pathway away from the looming threat of all-out conflict. The only credible first step for lowering the deadly temperature in the Middle East is a ceasefire in Gaza. In recent weeks the Americans have said that it was getting closer. That was always hard to imagine while the two sides’ definitions of an acceptable ceasefire were so far apart. For Hamas, a ceasefire meant an Israeli withdrawal and the end of hostilities. For Israel, it meant a pause that allowed for the release of some or all of the surviving hostages, and the right to resume the war afterwards. Now a ceasefire in Gaza looks as far away as ever, although the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said again that it remains America’s diplomatic priority. Ismail Haniyeh was a leading figure on the Hamas side in the ceasefire talks. With his colleagues, he communicated with the US and Israel via the head of the Egyptian secret service and the prime minister of Qatar, Sheikh Mohamed bin Jassim al Thani. The prime minister posted his response to the assassination of Haniyeh on X, writing: “Political assassinations and continued targeting of civilians in Gaza while talks continue leads us to ask how mediation can succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on the other side.” The assassination fits more closely into Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s conception of “total victory” over Hamas than into the American idea that a ceasefire is vital to avoid an even deeper regional catastrophe. It will also strengthen the belief held by Mr Netanyahu’s critics inside and outside Israel that he wants to prolong the war, to avoid the moment when he faces a reckoning of the mistakes he made that allowed Hamas the space to attack with such devastating consequences on 7 October. The Americans and French have also worked hard to find a diplomatic way to stop the border war between Israel and Hezbollah. But the vital first step would be a ceasefire in Gaza, and the prospect one was close has taken another hammer blow. Hamas has not confirmed the death of Mohammed Deif, who led the group's military wing. Iran has threatened “harsh punishment” for Israel, which it blames for Ismail Haniyeh's assassination in Tehran. Israel had accused Fuad Shukr, a top Hezbollah commanders, of masterminding operations against Israel. Widely considered the group's overall leader, Haniyeh had been a prominent member since the late 1980s. Ismail Haniyeh was elected head of Hamas's political bureau in 2017. Copyright 2024 BBC.

Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Walid Muhammad Salih Mubarak Bin Attash, and Mustafa Ahmed Adam al-Hawsawi have been held at the US Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for years without going to trial. Details of the deal have not been announced, but US news outlets say the men will plead guilty in exchange for the prosecution agreeing not to seek the death penalty. Nearly 3,000 people in New York, Virginia and Pennsylvania were killed in the attacks, which sparked the ""War on Terror"" and the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. Brett Eagleson, the president of 9/11 Justice, an organisation that represents 9/11 survivors and relatives of victims, said in a statement provided to the BBC that the families are “deeply troubled by these plea deals”. He said the process lacked transparency and urged the authorities to pursue more information on the role of Saudi Arabia in the attacks. Terry Strada, who lost her husband Tom, told the BBC’s Today Programme: ""It was a gut-punch to hear that there was a plea deal today that was giving the detainees in Guantanamo Bay what they want.” Ms Strada, the national chair of the campaign group 9/11 Families United, added: ""This is a victory for Khalid Sheikh Mohammad and the other two, it's a victory for them,"" she said.  The 9/11 attacks were the deadliest assault on US soil since the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, where 2,400 people were killed. The plea deal was first announced in a letter sent by prosecutors to the families of victims, according to The New York Times. It said the plea before a military court could come as early as next week. In its announcement, the US defence department said ""the specific terms and conditions of the pretrial agreements are not available to the public at this time"". The men have been accused of a litany of charges, including attacking civilians, murder in violation of the laws of war, hijacking and terrorism. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is widely considered the architect of the attack, in which hijackers seized passenger planes and crashed them into the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon outside of Washington. A fourth plane crashed into a field in Pennsylvania after passengers fought back. Mohammed, a US-educated engineer, was captured along with Hawsawi in Pakistan in March 2003. Prosecutors argued that he brought his idea of hijacking and flying planes into US buildings to al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, and later helped recruit and train some of the hijackers. He was subjected to a number of ""enhanced interrogation techniques"", including waterboarding - simulated drowning - at least 183 times before the practice was banned by the US government. The trial has been delayed for so long partly because of fears that the so-called brutal interrogation techniques which critics say amounted to torture could have undermined the evidence against the detainees. “This is the least bad deal in the real world that would ever happen,” national security analyst Peter Bergen told CNN. In September, the Biden administration reportedly rejected the terms of a plea deal with five men held at the US Navy base in Cuba, including Mohammed. The men had reportedly sought a guarantee from the president that they would not be kept in solitary confinement and would have access to trauma treatment. The White House National Security Council said that the president's office was told on Wednesday of the new deal and had played no role in negotiations. Fifteen of the 19 plane hijackers were Saudi nationals and families are bringing a lawsuit against the kingdom, which denies any involvement. Republicans were quick to attack the Biden administration for striking a deal with the accused. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell condemned the move as ""a revolting abdication of the government's responsibility to defend America and provide justice"". ""The only thing worse than negotiating with terrorists is negotiating with them after they are in custody,"" he said.

2,2024-08-01 15:05:46.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 13:05:36.000,'Is she black or Indian?': Trump questions Harris' racial identity,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c06k07dn1zjo,2024-07-31 21:28:44.000,"Donald Trump has questioned Kamala Harris' racial identity during a heated exchange at a convention for black journalists. Trump falsely claimed the vice-president and presumptive Democratic nominee had only emphasised her Asian-American heritage until recently when, he claimed, ""she became a black person"". ""I didn't know she was black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn black and now she wants to be known as black,"" he said at the National Association of Black Journalists convention in Chicago on Wednesday. ""So I don't know - Is she Indian? Or is she black?"" Ms Harris said Trump's remarks were ""the same old show"" of ""divisiveness... and disrespect"". ""The American people deserve better,"" she told a meeting of the historically black sorority Sigma Gamma Rho in Houston. ""We deserve a leader who understands that our differences do not divide us - they are an essential source of our strength."" Ms Harris is the first black and Asian-American vice-president, with Indian and Jamaican-born parents. She attended Howard University, a historically black university, and joined the predominantly black Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. She became a member of Congressional Black Caucus after entering the Senate in 2017. Trump's claims prompted a heated exchange with ABC News' correspondent Rachel Scott, one of the moderators of the Chicago event. ""I respect either one,"" the Republican said in reference to Harris' racial identity. ""But she obviously doesn't because she was Indian all the way and then all of a sudden she made a turn and she became a black person."" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said no-one ""has any right to tell someone who they are, how they identify. That is no-one's right."" ""Since when is Donald Trump, with his long and ugly history of racism, the arbiter of Blackness?"" congressman Ritchie Torres of New York posted on X. He described Trump as a “relic of a racist past"". The Republican nominee and former president has a history of attacking his opponents on the basis of race. He falsely accused Barack Obama, the country's first black president, of not being born in the US. Trump attacked the former UN ambassador and his Republican primary opponent Nikki Haley by falsely claiming she could not be president because her parents were not US citizens when she was born. Ms Harris has faced a series of attacks since becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee. Republicans have criticised the decision, saying she was chosen only because of her race. Tim Burchett, a Republican congressman from Tennessee, called her a ""DEI vice-president"" - a reference to diversity, equity and inclusion programmes. On Wednesday, Scott pushed Trump to clarify whether he believed Ms Harris was a ""DEI hire"". He replied: ""I really don't know, could be."" Ms Harris has described growing up engaged with her Indian heritage and often visited the country. Her mother also immersed her two daughters in the black culture of Oakland, California - where she was raised, she said. Trump also attacked Ms Harris' credentials during the discussion, saying she had failed her bar exam early in her legal career. His comments were met with murmurs from the crowd. ""I'm just giving you the facts. She didn't pass her bar exam and she didn't think she would pass it and she didn't think she was going to ever pass it and I don't know what happened. Maybe she passed it,"" he said. Ms Harris graduated from the University of California Hastings College of Law in 1989. The New York Times reported that she failed her first attempt and passed at the second. The state bar of California says fewer than half of those who sit the test pass on the first attempt. The Chicago discussion began with a contentious back and forth between Scott and the former president. Trump accused the journalist of giving a ""very rude introduction"" when she began the conversation asking about his past criticism of black people. She cited Trump calling black journalists' questions ''stupid and racist'' and that he had ''dinner with a white supremacist at your Mar a Lago resort''. ""I love the black population of this country, I’ve done so much for the black population of this country,” he responded. The former president criticised the conversation hours later on his social media platform. ""The questions were rude and nasty, often in the form of a statement, but we CRUSHED IT!"" he said.

2,2024-08-01 15:05:46.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 13:05:36.000,Why the world's anti-doping agency feels stuck between US and China,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2gygj1d28o,2024-08-01 00:53:05.000,"The World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) says it is ""unfairly caught"" in a row between the US and China, with their geopolitical tensions spilling onto the Olympic stage. China's top swimmers have been in the spotlight after a slew of doping allegations, followed by contentious US claims that Wada was covering it up. Chinese swimmers headed to Paris were drug-tested twice as much as some other nations, which, in turn, has fuelled accusations of a conspiracy to disrupt their performance. Wada said in its statement on Tuesday that it had been caught in ""the middle of geopolitical tensions between superpowers but has no mandate to participate in that"". ""Certain individuals [in the US] are attempting to score political points purely on the basis that the athletes in question are Chinese,"" Wada head of media relations James Fitzgerald told the BBC. ""The result is that it has created distrust and division within the anti-doping system."" A trade war, geopolitical rivalries and Beijing's friendship with Russia have soured relations between the world's two largest economies. It's little surprise that some of those tensions play out in competitive sports but now they appear to be driving a harder - and harsher - wedge. Last week, Wada had said it was considering legal action against its US counterpart, Usada, over ""defamatory"" accusations. The latter had accused Wada and China's anti-doping agency, Chinada, of being among the ""dirty hands in burying positive tests and suppressing the voices of courageous whistleblowers"". US lawmakers, too, have accused Wada of failing to investigate doping allegations against Chinese swimmers properly. And on Tuesday they introduced a bill that would give the White House power to cut funding to the agency. ""When members of congress and senators are inserting themselves into the largely technical world of anti-doping, it ceases to be about scientific and legal analysis, and it drifts into the political realm,"" said Mr Fitzgerald. Wada's statement on Tuesday followed reports in the New York Times about a previously undisclosed case involving two Chinese swimmers - including one on this year’s Olympic team - who were investigated for doping. They had tested positive for a banned steroid in 2022, but they were cleared to compete. China's anti-doping agency concluded that the athletes had most likely consumed the steroid unknowingly while eating contaminated burgers. Usada accused Wada of letting China ""compete under a different set of rules, tilting the field in their favour"". But Wada defended the decision. It said the athletes’ nutritional supplements and hair tests had returned negative results, and that both swimmers also provided control samples that were negative in the days before and after the one test that was positive. It added that the two swimmers were suspended for more than a year and then their cases were closed. Their cases are part of a ""wider series of cases involving [Chinese] athletes from different sports"", the agency said, adding that, ""based on the number of cases, clearly there is an issue of contamination in several countries around the world"". In a statement in June, Wada noted that athletes who eat meat sometimes test positive for drugs if they have ingested clenbuterol, a banned substance which is used as a growth promoter for farm animals. That statement, in response to questions from the New York Times, said the agency was investigating instances of contamination in China as well as Mexico, Guatemala and other countries. The agency's boss Olivier Niggli pointed out at the time that US media had ""only asked questions about China when meat contamination is an issue in many countries"", and referred to ""attempts to politicise anti-doping"". All of this follows a bigger controversy in April, when the New York Times reported that 23 Chinese swimmers had tested positive for a performance-enhancing drug months before the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. But they were cleared to compete after Chinese officials found the results were caused by contamination. The 30-member team went on to win six medals, inlcuding three golds in Tokyo. Eleven of those who tested positive were also picked to be part of the Chinese swimming team for the Paris Olympics. US swimmer and 11-time Olympic medalist Katie Ledecky had said her confidence in anti-doping regulators was at an ""all-time low"" after the news about the 23 Chinese swimmers. Wada's investigation, however, found that it was ""not in a position to disprove the possibility that contamination"" was the source of the drug, heart medication trimetazidine (TMZ). It said the contamination theory was supported by ""the combination of the consistently low concentrations of TMZ as well as no doping pattern"" among the tested athletes. That is, their test results over several days were not consistent, veering between negative and positive. An independent investigation found that Wada did not mishandle the case or show bias towards the Chinese swimmers. The scandals upped the pressure on anti-doping officals and by the time the Chinese swimming team arrived in Paris, they were being tested far more than is standard. Since January, each of the team's 31 members have been tested, on average, 21 times by various anti-doping organisations, according to World Aquatics, which oversees water sports. In comparison, Australia's 41 swimmers have been tested an average of four times and the 46 US swimmers, an average of six times. The flurry of tests has sparked another set of allegations. The state-run Chinese newspaper the Global Times blames Western powers for ""abusing doping tests to disrupt [the] Chinese swimming team"". Speaking to the Global Times, an international politics professor in Shanghai, accused the US of dominating anti-doping rules. Shen Yi suggested that the ""relentless and unethical testing"" had disrupted the Chinese team's training, which she called a ""disgrace to the Olympics"". Chinese swimmer Qin Haiyang, who holds the world record for the 200m men's breastroke, said this testing ""proves that European and American teams feel threatened by the performances of the Chinese team in recent years"". ""Some tricks aim to disrupt our preparation rhythm and destroy our psychological defence. But we are not afraid,"" he said on Chinese social media platform Weibo. Qin, who won golds in the 50m, 100m and 200m breaststroke at the world championships last year, finished in seventh place in the men's 100m breaststroke final on Sunday. This criticism was echoed by former Chinese diving champion Gao Min who said the rigorous testing had ""disrupted our Chinese swimming team"" and called Qin's performance ""the worst in any competition over the past two years”. China's current medal tally stands at one gold, two silver and two bronze. China's “butterfly queen”, Zhang Yufei, who won a silver in the 100m event in Tokyo, was in tears over her bronze finish on Monday but said the doping tests did not have a big impact on her. While they were a ""bit annoying"", she said it was the pressure that was ""far greater"" than she had imagined.

2,2024-08-01 15:05:46.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 13:05:36.000,Maduro promises voting data as observers say Venezuela election 'not democratic',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxx28wex0w6o,2024-08-01 04:30:31.000,"Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has insisted his party is ready to present all the vote tallies from his country's disputed election after election observers said it ""could not be considered democratic"". The National Electoral Council (CNE) declaration that Mr Maduro won has sparked two days of protests, with the country's opposition saying voting tallies show its candidate, Edmundo González, won by a wide margin. NGOs say there have been at least 11 deaths in protest-related violence and that dozens more have been injured. Speaking to journalists on Wednesday, Mr Maduro said again that his government’s reason for not publishing the electoral results was because of a “hack” on the electoral council website. He also claimed he had “proof” that the opposition leader, María Corina Machado, was behind “violence”. He alleged that protesters were ""attacking"" the constitution and asked the Supreme Court to take action, which could pave the way for more mass arrests of opposition figures or protesters. Top US diplomat for Latin America, Brian Nichols, said the evidence showed President Maduro overwhelmingly lost by ""millions"" of votes - endorsing vote tallies released by his opponents. ""The tabulation of these detailed results clearly show an irrefutable result: Edmundo González won with 67% of these votes compared to 30% for Maduro,"" he said in remarks at an Organisation of American States (OAS) meeting, AFP reported. ""While not a total result, there are not enough votes in remaining tally sheets... to overcome such a deficit,"" he continued. Earlier on Wednesday the US-based Carter Center - which was invited by Venezuelan officials to monitor Sunday's presidential poll - said it could not ""verify or corroborate the results of the election declared by CNE"". The Carter Center also said that the CNE's failure to announce the detailed results by polling station ""constitutes a serious breach of electoral principles"". It added that the CNE had ""demonstrated a clear bias in favour of the incumbent [President Nicolás Maduro]"" and accused the CNE of a ""complete lack of transparency in announcing the results"". With its statement, the Carter Center has joined a long list of countries and organisations pressuring the CNE to release detailed voting data at the polling station level, among them the US, Brazil and the EU. The US state department said the international community was running out of patience waiting for Venezuelan electoral authorities to release full detailed data on their country's election. The Carter Center statement is embarrassing for the Maduro government because its observers had been complimentary about the Venezuelan electoral system in the past. President Maduro has often quoted a remark by the Carter Center's founder, former US President Jimmy Carter, who in 2012 said that ""of the 92 elections that we've monitored, I would say the election process in Venezuela is the best in the world"". More than 1,000 people have so far been detained, according to Venezuela's attorney general, who also said that two members of the security forces had died in the protests. Ms Machado has urged her supporters to remain peaceful even if provoked by the government and its allies. On Tuesday, a close ally of President Maduro, National Assembly leader Jorge Rodríguez, called for the arrest of Ms Machado and Mr González, accusing them of leading a ""fascist conspiracy"". President Maduro told media on Wednesday Ms Machado and Mr González ""should be behind bars"", AFP reported. The Costa Rican foreign minister later offered Ms Machado and Mr González political asylum, saying that his government ""had been informed of arrest warrants"" against the two. Ms Machado thanked the Costa Rican government but said that it was her ""responsibility to continue this struggle alongside the people"". In a separate social media post late on Wednesday, Ms Machado urged her supporters to ""mobilise"". She wrote on X: ""It's time to trust in each other. To stay active and firm. ""It took time to win; now it's time to collect."" Videos show opposition protesters in multiple locations taking to the streets. Security forces fired tear gas and rubber bullets against people as thousands gathered in Caracas. Maduro's supporters are jubilant but the opposition is demanding proof of the voting numbers. Election officials say the president has an unassailable lead but the opposition vows to contest the result. Both Maduro and González, the opposition candidate, have claimed victory in this presidential election. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

Rory Golden was on the Oceangate expedition when contact with the sub and its five passengers was lost on a dive to the Titanic in June 2023. “We had this image in our heads of them being down there, running out of oxygen in the freezing cold, getting terribly frightened and scared,” he said. But after learning the sub had imploded just hours into the dive, he said it was a comfort to know those onboard hadn’t suffered. Mr Golden was on the Polar Prince support ship to give presentations about the Titanic when the submersible went missing. “When the sub was overdue we weren't unduly concerned because communications break down a lot in the ocean,” he explained. “But when the alarm was finally raised, that's when we realised that there were some serious issues.” A major search and rescue operation was launched by the US Coast Guard. A few days in, sounds of banging were detected underwater raising hope that these were coming from the missing sub. But it's now known that those onboard most likely died instantly after Titan suffered a catastrophic failure as it neared the Titanic at the bottom of the Atlantic. “We lived in false hope for four days,” Mr Golden said. “There’s still a lot of questions to be answered.” Those who perished were British explorer Hamish Harding, the British-Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman, Stockton Rush, the CEO of Oceangate, and French diver Paul Henri - or PH - Nargeolet. Rory Golden was a close friend of PH - a veteran deep sea explorer. He is now on the first expedition to the Titanic since the tragedy - an expedition that PH Nargeolet was supposed to be leading. A plaque is being laid in his honour at the wreck site and a memorial service for all those who died on the sub has been held at sea. Mr Golden told the BBC he was one of the last people to see PH alive. “He left the ship in great spirits, in great form and he was happy. He was going somewhere that he wanted to be.” Rory Golden had also visited the Titanic on the Oceangate sub. ”PH and I had discussed the submersible in the past and I had actually made a dive in it myself the year before,” he said. “And I'm here - as are many others. The Titan sub had made 15 dives to the Titanic up to that point, so it had worked. “I was comfortable, I spent 12 hours at the Titanic and it was a whole different experience being in a submersible that I could actually move around quite well in.” He told the BBC that he didn’t regret his dive at all. “It wasn't my time,” he said. “You never know when your time is going to come. And that certainly brought that home to all of us.” The discovery of the wreckage of Titan four days after it went missing confirmed the fate of those onboard. “We all cried when the remains were found of the sub,” he said. “A special bond has been formed between all of us who were there on the ship that week. And that's a bond that will always be there.” Industry experts had raised many serious questions about the safety of the Titan submersible prior to the dive. Investigations by the US Coast Guard and Canadian Coast Guard are still ongoing. They are likely to call for changes to ensure such a tragedy doesn’t happen again. A new expedition aims to document the world's most famous shipwreck in unprecedented detail. Graham Padden from Southport had a place booked but was unable to raise the money needed in time. The private submersible industry was shaken after the implosion of the OceanGate Titan sub last year. . Mary Roberts survived both the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 and the Rohilla in 1914.

2,2024-08-01 15:05:46.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 13:05:36.000,'Slave auction' pupils to face disciplinary in South Africa,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0ve3r5ydjvo,2024-07-31 18:34:18.000,"Four schoolchildren in South Africa are to face a disciplinary hearing over a viral video in which black students are seen being auctioned off as slaves, the authorities in Cape Town have told the BBC. The footage, showing pupils in a cage while other students bid for them, caused outrage when it was shared on social media last Friday. It was filmed at Pinelands High School and involved students in grade eight, which is the first year of secondary school when pupils are aged around 14. The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) has said it has opened its own investigation into the incident. It comes as two other schools in the country - where white-minority rule ended three decades ago with the election of anti-apartheid fighter Nelson Mandela as president - are dealing with alleged racist incidents. “It is disturbing that these incidences continue to occur 30 years into democracy,” the SAHRC said, adding it was even more distressing that they had occurred in schools. The four Pinelands High School students believed to be behind the mock auction are currently suspended. “The investigation is ongoing and nearing completion with 24 learners having been interviewed in the first two [school days] since the allegations were made,” Bronagh Hammond, spokesperson for the Western Cape Education Department, said on Wednesday in a statement sent to the BBC. “Steps will also be taken against other learners who may have transgressed certain provisions within the code of conduct,” she added. The incident first came to light after one of the pupils showed the footage to his mother, Merle Potgieter, who then told the school's management and local media. She says her son, who is 14, fought off boys who were attempting to force him into the caged enclosure alongside other black boys who were already inside it. According to Ms Potgieter the alleged perpetrators were coloured - which is a South African term meaning mixed-race. In the footage of the mock auction, children can be heard calling out various bids of up to 100,000 rand ($5,400; £4,200). ""Going once... going twice... sold!"" one boy can be heard shouting. Counselling support had been prioritised for those affected - and all grade eight pupils had had debriefing sessions, Ms Hammond said. Slavery in Cape Town dates back to the 1650s when the Dutch colonised the peninsula and thousands of enslaved people were brought to the region from south-east Asia, Madagascar and Mozambique. Today Cape Town is considered one of the most racially segregated and unequal cities in South Africa, despite its multi-ethnic mix. This is due to the legacy of apartheid, when the white regime in the 1950s pushed black and mixed-raced communities into segregated townships outside the city. The apartheid government also entrenched a racial hierarchy, which put black people right at the bottom. On Tuesday, MP Makhi Feni, chair of the parliamentary committee on education, urged the schools at the heart of the latest scandals to “consider meaningful programmes that will foster social cohesion and South African-ness”. “The question we all ought to ask genuinely is what emboldens a person, hardly a teenager, with no knowledge of where we come from as a country, to act in a manner that points to racism. Surely, our children are not and should not be racist,” he said. Meanwhile, the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party is demanding that the pupils be suspended for at least two years and perform ""community service in black areas"". It has threatened to call protests and shut down the school if it finds the authorities' ultimate handling of the incident less than satisfactory.

The army is constructing a temporary bridge to Mundakkai, which is across a swollen river, to help stranded residents and search for more survivors. Health officials reported 256 autopsies, but that included a number of body parts. On Thursday, Wayanad remained on high alert for more rains as schools and colleges were closed for the day. The hilly district is known for its cardamom plantations and tea estates and has several popular tourist spots. Officials said nearly 1,600 people had been rescued from the affected villages and tea estates. But migrant workers from the estates were among those still missing. More than 8,000 people have been moved to 82 relief camps set up in the district, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said. The army is now building a temporary metal bridge to Mundakkai village, which is among the worst affected by the landslides. Earlier, rescuers had constructed a temporary pedestrian bridge and used ropes to rappel across the river to reach stranded people there and move the injured to hospitals. But heavy rains and strong river current had made it difficult to carry out full-fledged rescue work. The temporary metal bridge is expected to be complete by Thursday evening. It will allow ambulances and heavy machinery to move rubble and search for survivors, Major General Vinod Mathew told reporters. Meanwhile, the air force is conducting sorties to identify areas with survivors and distribute relief material. Three army sniffer dogs were expected to reach the disaster zone to help detect people still trapped under the rubble. ""Still large areas are to be explored and searched to find out whether live people are there or not,"" senior police officer MR Ajith Kumar told AFP news agency on Wednesday. TV footage showed harrowing scenes at relief camps and hospitals as survivors searched for their loved ones or waited for news of them. One man listed out names of those who had still not been found as he told Manorama News, ""My house was spared but I have lost many children who were like my own."" At a community centre that had bodies displayed for identification, a young man told The NewsMinute that he had identified two of his uncles, but was still searching for seven other relatives. ""I am in touch with people at other centres where bodies are placed and they are sending me pictures, but I am yet to identify any of my other missing relatives,"" he told the news site. With more heavy rainfall forecast for the district, the government has warned residents to be prepared for flash floods. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

From 15 August onwards, the carrier will stop serving the noodles to economy class passengers. It said the increased risk of turbulence, narrow aisles and passengers sitting closely together could mean ""burn incidents occur frequently"". Business and first class fliers, however, will continue to enjoy the treat. The snack has long been a passenger favourite and something the carrier is widely known for. Many praise the fact that it is available for free on request. In a statement, the carrier said that since 2019 the number of times turbulence had occurred on its flights had doubled. It added that in economy class, several cups of noodles are all served at once, saying that the ""risk of burns is greater with passengers crowded together"". But in business and first class the snacks are brought individually to these passengers, reducing the likelihood of spillage in the event of turbulence, the carrier said. Up until now, the Korean carrier had been providing the noodles for free to passengers on longer routes. But this will now be replaced with sandwiches, corn dogs, pizza and ""Hot Pockets"" - crusty turnovers filled with cheese, meat and vegetables. The move sparked discussion on social media. Some users expressed relief, while others pointed out that the carrier was still serving other items that could cause burns. ""Aren't coffee and tea hot?"" said one comment. However, another called it a ""very good decision"", saying they had always been ""nervous"" that they would be scalded. One user said they had hoped the instant noodles would be removed ""because of the smell"". Korean Air said it will ""continue to seek service methods that are safe while increasing customer convenience and satisfaction"". Earlier this year, Singapore Airlines said it would stop serving hot drinks and meals during turbulence as part of a ""more cautious approach"". A 73-year-old British passenger died and dozens more were injured when flight SQ 321 encountered turbulence over Myanmar and was diverted to Thailand in May. Turbulence is one of the most unpredictable of all weather phenomena, with severe turbulence becoming more likely with climate change, recent research shows. It is thought the technology will enable quicker and cleaner journeys across short distances. Some Rex Airlines flights have since been cancelled, with a number of its planes grounded The airline blamed difficulties securing more efficient aircraft and sustainable jet fuel. Thousands more passengers could face delays or cancellations after an arson attack on France's train network on Friday. South Korea said it would request a meeting with International Olympic Committee Chairman Thomas Bach. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

2,2024-08-01 15:05:46.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 13:05:36.000,Uber strikes EV deal with Chinese Tesla rival BYD,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cley0xn8e88o,2024-08-01 04:30:56.000,"Uber has announced a deal which aims to bring 100,000 electric vehicles (EVs) made by China's BYD to the ride-hailing giant's global fleet of cars. The two companies say they will offer Uber drivers incentives to switch to electric cars, including discounts on maintenance, charging, financing and leasing. The multi-year agreement will be rolled out first in Europe and Latin America, before being made available in the Middle East, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The announcement comes as EV sales around the world have slowed and Chinese car makers face higher import charges in places like the US and the European Union. ""The companies aim to bring down the total cost of EV ownership for Uber drivers, accelerating the uptake of EVs on the Uber platform globally, and introducing millions of riders to greener rides,"" the two firms said in a statement. They also said they will work to integrate BYD's self-driving technologies into Uber's platform. Earlier this year, Uber said it was working with Tesla to promote EV adoption among its drivers in the US and planned to develop a purpose-built EV with South Korean car giant Kia. The US, the European Union and other major markets have recently announced tariff hikes on China-made EVs in moves aimed at protecting their car industries. The move has prompted BYD and other Chinese EV makers to expand their production facilities outside China. In July, BYD agreed a $1bn (£780m) deal to set up a manufacturing plant in Turkey. The new plant will be able to produce up to 150,000 vehicles a year, according to Turkish state news agency Anadolu. The facility is expected to create around 5,000 jobs and start production by the end of 2026. Also last month, BYD opened an EV plant in Thailand - its first factory in South East Asia. BYD said the plant will have an annual capacity of 150,000 vehicles and is projected to generate 10,000 jobs. At the end of last year, BYD announced it would build a manufacturing plant in EU member state Hungary. It will be the firm's first passenger car factory in Europe and is expected to create thousands of jobs. The company has also said it is planning to build a manufacturing plant in Mexico. BYD, which is backed by veteran US investor Warren Buffett, is the world’s second-largest EV company after Elon Musk's Tesla. MADE NE aims to create a new generation of workers in the electric vehicle and battery sectors. More than 1.8 million cars are due to get a software fix, US safety regulators said. Pilling work is to start imminently at the multi-billion-pound car battery factory near Bridgwater. The aim to train a skilled workforce for sectors including electric vehicle and battery production. A number of on-street locations have been proposed and residents can still make suggestions. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

2,2024-08-01 15:05:46.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 13:05:36.000,Italy opens controversial migrant centre in Albania,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lke090kgko,2024-08-01 07:20:23.000,"Italy, which receives the most migrant arrivals in the European Union, is partially outsourcing the challenge from today, as it opens the first of two planned camps in neighbouring Albania. The centres will be used to house up to 3000 migrants per month rescued en route to Italy as part of Europe’s first ""offshoring"" scheme, while the continent grapples with how to respond to the challenge of irregular migration. The camp that opens today is located in the northern Albanian port of Shengjin. The opening of a second centre, on a former air force base in nearby Gjader, has been delayed. The structures will be entirely managed by the Italian government, which paid for their construction. They will be used for migrants picked up in international waters – though not women, children, or those deemed vulnerable. Once there, they will be allowed to request asylum in Italy. If refused, they will be sent back to countries deemed safe to return. “Italian and European legislation will be applied in these centres,"" Fabrizio Bucci, Italy’s ambassador in Albania, told me. “It’s like having a centre in Italy – but in Albania.” The agreement signed by the Italian and Albanian Prime Ministers will remain in place for five years – with the option to extend if it proves successful in reducing the migrant burden on Italy and deterring some from attempting to come. Arrivals in Italy by sea this year – around 31,000 so far – are down by more than half from the same period in 2023. Giorgia Meloni, the Italian Prime Minister, ran for office promising to clamp down hard on migration – and the Albania plan has become a key tenet of that. The hefty price tag, estimated at upwards of €650m (£547), is one of the criticisms levelled by Italian opposition politicians and human rights groups. “It’s an excessive cost to detain a limited number of migrants”, said Riccardo Magi, an MP with the left-wing +Europa party. When Ms Meloni recently visited the site in Albania, he approached her car to protest – and was grabbed by Albanian security officials. As she intervened, telling them to ease off, he shouted: “If they treat an elected MP like this, imagine how they’ll treat the migrants”. Speaking to the BBC, he compared the structures to a penal colony. He also doubted the ability of night-time rescuers to properly screen those picked up to ensure that no vulnerable individuals are sent to Albania. ""They won’t be able to delve deep into whether somebody has suffered torture or sexual violence or discrimination due to their sexuality back in Africa”, Mr Magi said. “It’s all an attempt at dissuasion and a PR show to tell Italians this is the first time a government can keep migrants out. But nobody who has risked their life to cross to Italy will be discouraged.” Fabrizio Bucci, the Italian ambassador in Tirana, disagrees. “It’s one of the elements that migrants and smugglers will have to factor in,"" he said. “What do we have to lose? We’ve been trying to redistribute migrants throughout the EU and it hasn’t worked. So why not try to chart a new way?” He refers to it as an experiment that, if successful, could be replicated. Indeed, 15 EU members, led by Denmark, recently wrote an open letter to the European Commission backing the outsourcing of migration. Sir Keir Starmer praised the Italy-Albania deal after meeting both Prime Ministers. It has drawn comparison with the plan of the previous Conservative government to deport failed asylum seekers from the United Kingdom to Rwanda – ditched by Mr Starmer. But the agreements are significantly different. While Rwanda would have managed the asylum requests and centres under its deal, giving successful claimants asylum there and deporting failed ones to third countries deemed safe by the Rwandan government, the Albania deal will be under Italian jurisdiction. “We made sure the Albanian legislation was already in full compliance with EU and international laws”, said Ambassador Bucci. For Albania, the reward is a boost to its image as it negotiates European Union membership. But Vladimir Karaj, a Tirana-based journalist with the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network, said it was a “complete surprise” when it was announced by the Prime Minister Edi Rama. Before the Rwanda deal was struck, there were reports that Britain was aiming for an agreement with Albania, which Mr Rama forcefully shot down. “He claimed he was strictly against this kind of treatment for refugees”, he said. “So when Albania struck the deal with Italy, there was huge speculation over what Rama was gaining personally."" Mr Karaj says there’s no ""smoking gun"": ""The government’s narrative is that Italy is our best friend and took in Albanians when our dictatorship fell in the 1990s.” The deal, Mr Karaj said, has been met only with short-lived protests by some claiming it was aimed at replacing Albanians with foreigners, or giving away territory to Italy. He suspects other countries may now come knocking on Albania’s door. “Albania needs the support it can get from the west”, he said. “If western governments like the UK or Germany see this is a solution, I don’t think Rama’s words about it just being for Italy will be that easy to sell.” The NCA says the boat continued its journey to the UK and arrived in Dover carrying about 40 people. Ms Meloni last year removed Italy from President Xi Jinping's signature Belt and Road Initiative. Michael Frison, from Chard, went missing in Sardinia on 13 July. The World Champion blamed ""losing too many kilos"" and ""irrepressible enthusiasm"" for the mishap. The bill will allow troops to open fire on migrants crossing the border when soldiers feel under threat. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

2,2024-08-01 15:05:46.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 13:05:36.000,"Sex, money, social media - how VP contenders are vetted",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv30gx7xkko,2024-07-31 15:09:34.000,"As Democratic presidential hopeful Kamala Harris vets potential running mates, spare a thought for the contenders as they undergo a process that one past participant likens to ""a colonoscopy performed with a telescope”. Have you ever paid for sex? Have you ever paid for an abortion? Have you ever had a homosexual encounter? This is just some of the material in questionnaires fired off during the exhaustive vetting process for previous US vice-presidential nominees. Potential partners to join Ms Harris on the Democratic ticket for November's election will have to answer up to 200 questions before they can even begin to be seriously considered. The vetters - campaign officials and lawyers who volunteer their billable hours for the networking and prestige - often have about a month to dig up every grain of dirt they can find. The Harris campaign has a matter of days to pick a running mate, with a paperwork deadline looming. The vice-president, who went through the process herself only four years ago, has been assessing around a dozen contenders, with Governor Josh Shapiro and Senator Mark Kelly among those being touted. Pete Buttigieg, who is also among the rumoured potential picks, was asked this week if the possible running mates are aware they are being vetted. ""Yeah, you know,"" he said with a smile. What makes the whole undertaking especially challenging is that, unlike with cabinet picks, the FBI does not perform background checks on vice-presidents. The vetters will pore over a contender’s tax returns and medical history. They may log on to his or her private social media accounts. They will scour the social media posts of his or her children. The grandchildren’s, too. The least suggestion of marital infidelity, or any other skeleton in the closet, will be picked apart. They will check every record of every word the potential candidate has ever uttered or written. Jim Hamilton, a Democratic lawyer who evaluated potential running mates for John Kerry, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, told the BBC that notes of the process are destroyed afterwards to preserve “a strict, strict veil of confidentiality”. He oversaw more than 200 lawyers who were tasked with finding Mrs Clinton’s running mate (she picked Virginia Senator Tim Kaine). “Everybody's got something in their background they’d just sooner not talk about,” Mr Hamilton said. “But you'd be surprised, once people commit to the process, at how candid they are in their answers.” Evan Bayh, a finalist to become Barack Obama’s running mate in 2008, remembers the procedure took nearly three months and was “like having a colonoscopy performed with a telescope”. “There was a whole team assigned to me: an accountant, a lawyer, a physician, you know,” the former Indiana senator and governor told the BBC. “They talked to my wife, they talked to my father.” Television crews were soon camped outside his house in Washington DC. Mr Bayh recalls his shock one morning as he sat down to breakfast with the television on and heard an MSNBC host remark that the senator’s bowl of yoghurt and granola “sure looks tasty”. The head of the vetting team phoned one day to ask Mr Bayh about a false internet rumour that he had once received psychiatric treatment. “And I said, ‘No, it's not true. But if you guys don't hurry up and make a decision, it might be true,’” he remembers joking. A list of 20 names was whittled away. Mr Bayh says it ultimately came down to himself and Joe Biden, then a Delaware senator. He recalls how he was flown out “very clandestinely” to St Louis, Missouri, in August that year to meet the future president in his hotel room. They spoke for around three hours. “There was about a three-foot high stack of materials there,” he recalls, ""that he [Mr Obama] just gestured to it, and he said, ‘I've gone over all the reports on you, and nothing in there bothers me.’ “He said, ‘But if there's anything that our team didn't discover, you should tell me now because it will come out.’ “And I said, ‘Well, your people did do a very thorough job. But there were probably two or three things I should mention to you.’ And I did. “And he looked at me, he said, ‘That's it?' And I said, 'Yeah, that's it.’ And he said, ‘Well, you haven't led very much of a life, have you?’” Mr Bayh did not elaborate to the BBC on his disclosures to Mr Obama in the hotel room, except to say they were family matters. Mr Biden was ultimately successful. Campaign manager David Plouffe later quoted President Obama as saying it was a “coin toss” between the two. Sometimes a vetter can pose a question that no-one else thought of, revealing a potential red flag, even if it’s not disqualifying. Gary Ginsberg, who worked for the Clinton campaign in ’92, told the BBC he remembers Al Gore at a loss for words when asked during the process if he had any friends. The reserved Tennessee senator bristled. But when pressed, he could name none, beyond his brother-in-law and two congressmen. Mr Gore’s lack of a social circle bothered one top campaign official. From a long-list of 50, he was nevertheless picked to be running mate. They won. Mr Gore, however, would struggle to overcome low personal likability ratings. The vetting process used to be largely informal and much less invasive, since it was seen as rude to ask a senator or governor about personal matters. Two selection disasters changed all that forever. In 1972, the Democratic White House nominee George McGovern dumped his running mate after just 18 days. He had picked Missouri Senator Thomas Eagleton based on a two-minute phone conversation and no background check. It almost immediately emerged in media reports that Mr Eagleton had received electroshock treatment in hospital for clinical depression a decade earlier. Nixon aides began asking reporters: “How could McGovern be trusted after putting a crazy man on the ticket?” In that November’s election, the Republican president annihilated his Democratic challenger. Vetters soon began to cast their nets wider, to look more closely at a potential running mate’s family members, after another embarrassment upended the 1984 White House race. Democratic nominee Walter Mondale needed a game-changer against Ronald Reagan that year, so he picked Geraldine Ferraro, the first female running mate ever on a major party national ticket. But the campaign was hamstrung by revelations about her real estate developer husband’s financial dealings. President Reagan went on to win 49 states in a landslide re-election. Sometimes a potential running mate dazzles at the audition, but fizzles on the political stage. In 2008, Republican presidential nominee John McCain’s campaign had just 72 hours to vet Sarah Palin. The then-44-year-old Alaska governor was asked by aides how she would react in a national security crisis where the president had been temporarily incapacitated by surgery. Under this scenario, the director of national intelligence comes to Acting-President Palin and tells her they have pinpointed Osama Bin Laden. A plane is overhead ready to kill the al-Qaeda leader. But there’ll be multiple civilian casualties. “Do you take the shot?” the vetter asked her. “Yes,” she said, “I would take the shot because I’m the President of the United States, this is our archenemy who took the lives of 3,000-plus Americans. And then I would get down on my knees and ask for forgiveness for the innocent souls whose lives I would be taking.” The vetters were highly impressed with this answer. Yet after she was unveiled as the vice-presidential nominee, Ms Palin proved unable to answer a reporter’s basic question about what newspapers she read. Soon she was seen as gaffe-prone and unready for the political primetime. Even when the vetting process is conducted with more rigour, the final decision is always up to the nominee. George HW Bush - one of the 15 US vice-presidents who became president- went with his gut when he picked little-known Indiana Senator Dan Quayle to be his running mate in 1988. Though they won, Mr Quayle, 41, was widely seen as more of a liability than an asset to the ticket, as recounted in the book First in Line, by Kate Andersen Brower. The vice-presidential nominee was asked by a reporter aboard the campaign plane in 1988: “What’s the favourite book that you’ve read?” Mr Quayle turned to his wife, Marilyn. “What’s the favourite book I’ve read?” he asked her, leaving a nearby political aide aghast.

2,2024-08-01 15:05:46.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 13:05:36.000,Kenya rolls out poison in bid to cull a million crows,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c999n2nyvwlo,2024-08-01 06:43:48.000,"""Invasive alien birds"" sounds like the strapline to a scary Hollywood blockbuster but for the people of coastal Kenya it is not a matter of fiction. The authorities there are so worried about the nuisance created by Indian house crows that they have begun the process of culling a million of them. They have not targeted humans, as in the Alfred Hitchock horror film The Birds, but these ones have for decades caused widespread disruption, by preying on wildlife, raiding tourist areas and attacking poultry farms. Poison is now being used in the towns of Watamu and Malindi to kill the first tranche of the ruthless sub-species. This ambitious poisoning campaign is aimed at halting the crows’ advance towards the capital, Nairobi. The birds, known on the coast as ""kunguru"" or ""kurabu"", originated from India and other parts of Asia, often spreading elsewhere by travelling on trading ships. But they are believed to have been intentionally introduced in East Africa around 1890s in a bid to tackle a mounting waste problem on the Zanzibar archipelago, then a British protectorate. From there, they spread to the mainland and up the coast to Kenya. They were first recorded in the port of Mombasa in 1947 and since then, their numbers have exploded, thanks to the growing human population and the accompanying mounds of rubbish, which provide an ideal environment for the birds to feed and breed. They also have no natural predators. The Indian house crows, considered one of the world’s most invasive and destructive birds, have continued their northward journey. ""They prey on the indigenous species, not just birds but also mammals, reptiles - and so their impact on biodiversity is devastating,"" Jaap Gijsbertsen, a Dutch bird expert, who is visiting Kenya's Watamu area, told the BBC. Conservationists say that the crows have significantly reduced the number of small indigenous birds in the region, such as weavers and waxbills, by ripping their nests apart while targeting eggs and even chicks. ""When the population of local birds declines, the environment begins to suffer. There will be a possible increase of harmful pests and insects that the birds prey on,"" Lennox Kirao, a research scientist with conservation group A Rocha Kenya, said. They also damage crops, livestock and chickens. ""They pounce on chicks and eat them like madmen. These are not normal birds, they act wildly,"" said Eunice Katana, a resident of Takaye village in Kilifi county. They are also known to use a unique sound to communicate distress - or when they spot a prey, according to Mr Kirao. The birds have defaced houses in Mombasa by defecating on the walls and roofs, while many people shy away from sitting under tree shades for fear of being dirtied by their droppings. ""These crows rise early and interrupt our sleep with their annoying squeals and cawing,"" Mombasa resident Victor Kimuli told the BBC. Given all these issues the authorities felt they had to act and aim to halve the Indian house crow population through poisoning, which began on Tuesday. This follows months of consultations with environmental experts, conservationists, community leaders and representatives from the hotel industry, the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) said. ""We are trying to get their population down to a controllable number,"" said Mr Kirao. The culling process involves months of pre-baiting - where the birds are encouraged, through leaving meat out, to gather at various places near their roost sites. ""We then poison them after pulling together the highest number in the baiting sites,"" Eric Kinoti, an official from the A Rocha Kenya, said. An avian poison called Starlicide is so far the only known substance that has proved effective in reducing crow numbers, without affecting other birds or animals. Close to 2,000 crows were killed in 2022 during efficacy tests carried out on the poison by Little Kenya Gardens, the company licensed to import the poison, Cecilia Ruto, owner of the firm, said. ""The slow-acting poison is entirely metabolised by the crow before it dies – which means, there is little risk of secondary poisoning to any other species that feeds on the dead crow,"" Ms Ruto added. There are currently 2kg (4.4lb) of the poison in the country which is estimated to be able to kill about 20,000 crows in the ongoing eradication. But there are plans to import more from New Zealand. Its use in Kenya has, however, raised ethical concerns from animal and bird rights activists, who argue that poisoning the crows is inhumane and that alternative and non-lethal methods should be explored. “Mass poisoning is a short-term solution that does not address the root cause of the problem,” said Leonard Onyango, an environmentalist. “There is a need to look at sustainable, humane approaches to manage the crow population,” he added. But those involved in the programme emphasise the need to protect native species and ensure ecological balance. “If we do nothing now, the damage could become irreversible,” said Mr Kirao, who is involved in the culling programme. This is not the first time the government has initiated plans to control invasive bird species. The previous attempt more than 20 years ago reduced the bird population, but the government later banned the importation of Starlicide in an effort to regulate what was coming into the country. Apart from dump sites, tourist hotels have become the crows’ favourite haunt, where they flock dining areas, disrupting guests as they enjoy their meals, hotel owners have complained. “The crows have really become a big bother to guests who visit our hotels to enjoy their meals outside the tropical beaches,"" Maureen Awuor, the Kenya Association of Hotelkeepers and Caterers chairperson, said. Some hotels trap and suffocate the crows, while others have hired staff with catapults to scare them. But trapping is said to be ineffective as the birds are intelligent enough to avoid areas where they witness other crows dying or being trapped. Despite the huge numbers which are planned to be culled, the authorities feel that they have no choice, especially now that there are concerns that the crows could spread inland. The birds have been spotted in the Mtito Andei area - about 240km (150 miles) from the capital, Nairobi, conservationists say. ""My biggest fear is, if we don't do anything now, the crows will reach Nairobi. This will pose a great threat to birdlife in the country, especially at the Nairobi National Park,"" Mr Kirao said.

2,2024-08-01 15:05:46.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 13:05:36.000,"50 jobs, 30 years: The unseen labour of an Indian female worker",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ck7g9kjdrpmo,2024-07-31 23:55:23.000,"Syeda X, a poor migrant woman living in shanty towns that skirt India’s capital Delhi, struggled through more than 50 jobs in 30 years. She trimmed jeans threads, cooked savouries, shelled almonds and made tea strainers, door knobs, photo frames and toy guns. She also stitched school bags and did bead and jewellery work. Despite her hard work, she earned meagre wages, like 25 rupees (30 cents; 23 pence) for assembling 1,000 toy guns. The protagonist of a new book, The Many Lives of Syeda X, by journalist Neha Dixit, Syeda relocated to Delhi with her family in the mid-1990s after religious riots in the neighbouring state of Uttar Pradesh. Reported over 10 years with more than 900 interviews, the book highlights, in part, the precarious life of an Indian home-based female worker. Ms Dixit’s book shines a spotlight on the invisible lives of India’s neglected female home-based workers. After being recognised officially as a distinct category of workers only in 2007, India defined a home-based worker as someone who produces goods or services for an employer from their own home or chosen premises, regardless of whether the employer provides equipment or materials. Over 80% of working women in India are employed in the informal economy, with home-based work being the largest sector after agriculture. Yet, no legislation or policy supports these women. Wiego, an organisation that supports women in informal employment, estimated that by 2017-18, women comprised about 17 million of the 41 million home-based workers in India. These women represented approximately 9% of total employment. Their numbers in the city have grown faster than in India’s countryside. “The centre of gravity in home-based workers appears to be shifting to urban areas,” says Indrani Mazumdar, a historian who has worked extensively on the subject. Bereft of social security or any protection, these women are in a constant battle with poverty, precariousness and wayward spouses. Often their family’s main breadwinners, they strive to earn enough to educate their children out of poverty. These women also face the brunt of climate change, losing livelihoods and running losses: monsoon waterlogging in their homes leads to wastage of their supplied material. In India, around 75% of female workers in manufacturing work are home-based, says economist Sona Mitra. “These women are recorded as self-employed and they are largely invisible,” she adds. Ms Dixit’s harrowing narrative portrays Syeda X and other home-based working women as archetypes of helplessness and exploitation. No-one knows who sets the abysmal rates for their work. No-one provides instructions, training, or tools. These women rely solely on each other to learn how to get the job done. Finding work is also often about following the news cycle, Ms Dixit writes. When Kalpana Chawla became the first Indian-origin woman in space in 1997, women dressed plastic dolls in hand-stitched white spacesuits. During the 1999 cricket World Cup, they stitched hundreds of cheap footballs. A viral 2001 rumour about a “monkey man” attacking people in Delhi spurred a demand for masks resembling the creature to be sold at traffic crossings. During elections, they made flags, key rings and caps for political parties. When schools resumed, they packed crayons and school bags and bound books. Many women also find it difficult to get home-based work for more than 20 days a month. Ms Dixit writes that only those who don't negotiate rates or ask too many questions, buy their own tools, deliver on time, never ask for advances or help during crises and tolerate delayed payments are able to find work easily. The precarity of female home workers has increased due to changes in the nature of the work, according to Ms Mazumdar. Up until the 1990s, the readymade garment industry outsourced many tasks to home workers. This shifted in the 1990s as factories began bringing tasks in-house and machines replaced human labour, particularly for embroidery. ""Home-based work became very volatile,"" she says. In 2019, the International Labour Organisation, drawing on household surveys in 118 countries, estimated there were around 260 million home-based workers worldwide, representing 7.9% of the global employment. Research from Brazil and South Africa shows that monitoring work conditions and protecting workers' rights in subcontracted or home-based work is possible when local governments and trade unions collaborate effectively. Such examples in India are few and far between. There's the 52-year-old Self Employed Women’s Association (Sewa), a membership-based organisation that unites poor, self-employed women in the informal economy. There are self-help groups of home-based workers and micro-finance to support them. ""But these schemes have really not helped them when it comes to employment,"" says Ms Mazumdar. In 2009, women in Delhi who shelled and cleaned almonds from homes stopped working, demanding better pay and overtime, among other things. (They were paid 50 rupees for cleaning a 23kg bag for 12-16 hours.) The strike paralysed the almond processing industry at its peak season. A study in Tamil Nadu state by social scientist K Kalpana illustrated how home and neighbourhood-based female workers subcontracted to make appalams (papadum) in Chennai successfully defended their rights, despite government agencies ignoring claims of trade unions. Syeda X and her friends had no such luck. “If she ever took time off to nurse an illness or to attend to her children, her job would be lost to another faceless migrant, fighting to take her place,” writes Ms Dixit. Displacement and hardship were the only constants in her life, shifting from job to job and home to home. Follow BBC India on YouTube, Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

2,2024-08-01 15:05:46.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 13:05:36.000,Video games strike rumbles on in row over AI,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czvxz11gl57o,2024-07-31 23:46:32.000,"Actors from the world of gaming went on strike last week, in a row about the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and the threat it poses to their livelihoods. It has reignited the debate about how the entertainment industry is adapting to new technology. When actor Jennifer Hale talks, you listen. Her delivery is measured and surgically precise, yet her tone has a warmth that most ASMR creators would envy. She could read the phone book and you’d pay attention. It’s unsurprising, then, that her voice is her livelihood, and that she takes the threat to her industry posed by AI so seriously. “They see that the work of our souls is nothing more than a commodity to generate profits for them,"" she says of several of the major gaming companies. ""They don't see that they're crushing human beings beneath their feet in blind pursuit of money and profit, it's disgusting."" From Commander Shepard in the Mass Effect series to Samus Aran in the Metroid titles, Hale’s list of gaming credits is as long as your arm and her voice is familiar to millions. Hale is one of the most high-profile voice actors in the world. She’s joined 2,500 members of the US actors union SAG-AFTRA who perform in games, by striking until games divisions of prominent companies like Activision, Warner Brothers, Walt Disney and EA agree to protections around the use of artificial intelligence (AI). She tells BBC News: “They could, for example, take all my performances in a game, let's say Mass Effect, feed them into a machine, not too long down the timeline, spit out an entirely new Mass Effect, with a performance that was entirely generated by AI.” Concerns about AI were one of the key issues in last year’s 118-day actors strike organised by SAG-AFTRA. Terms were eventually agreed with Hollywood studios for film and TV actors. But the dispute around videogames has rumbled on, finally boiling over into a strike on 25 July. While both sides have agreed on a host of issues, AI protections remains a sticking point. Hale may be one of the most successful voice actors in the business but in contrast to those who work in front of the camera and despite the games industry generating revenue estimated to be around $189bn (£147bn) in 2024, voice acting in games is considerably less well paid than film and TV work. “I’m a single working mother who has bills to pay and a life to provide for my kid, as voice actors we don't get paid star salaries. Under what they're proposing on the other side of this contract, they would pay me nothing.” Audrey Cooling, a representative of the 10 game companies negotiating with the union, told BBC News: ""Our offer is directly responsive to SAG-AFTRA’s concerns and extends meaningful AI protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers working under the IMA [Interactive Media Agreement]."" This is an ongoing deal to cover artists working in video games. Hale argues not all games companies are the problem, some businesses can and are making deals which work for all sides. “Anybody sitting in their basement, anywhere making a game can go to SAG and say, hey, my budget is small, I only have this much money. I really want to work with these good actors. What can I do in SAG will say, absolutely, here you go, how big are you? Great here's your structure."" She adds this strike might be a symptom of a growing unease in the wider workplace with AI. “We actors are the canary in the coal mine. You can see them coming for us, but if they dismiss it, if it gets swept under the rug because we're just performers, what does that mean?” On the other side of the Atlantic, John Barclay, assistant general secretary of the UK actor’s union Equity, released a statement of solidarity with its stateside counterparts. “We stand shoulder to shoulder with SAG-AFTRA as partners in a global fight to secure fair pay and protect our members’ rights, which could not be more urgent as we move forward with artificial intelligence innovation.” Regulations around strikes are different in the UK, Equity members aren’t striking and neither will UK members of SAG-AFTRA be compelled to. Actor David Menkin has provided the voice for Luke Skywalker in Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, as well as voice work in Final Fantasy XVI and Horizon Zero Dawn, amongst a host of other games. He explains: “Here in the UK, we don't have a mutually agreed contract between the union Equity and the producers that make these games. So therefore, even if you're SAG-AFTRA but you were hired on a UK based contract, you can't stop, you cannot strike, you cannot leave the production, you have to fulfil everything in your contract.” He tells me he’ s concerned that US companies may try and work around the issue of striking American actors by coming to the UK and hiring British talent to perform in games instead. “All we can do is make sure that if the work is dumped in the UK, that we are making sure that UK-based actors are fully informed.” In the US the strike continues and while she waits for both sides to return to the negotiating table, Jennifer Hale hopes long time creative concerns will overcome short-term commercial gain. “I hope they see that we are all in this together. I don't understand why they're willing to kill us all off to increase things a few percentage points, it makes no sense to me."" Vets say artificial intelligence is saving lives, but the RCVS says it must be used responsibly. The programme aims to support people and firms in using the technology, Digital Isle of Man says. The increased use of AI may prevent tickets being resold at excessively high prices. Ask Tom will be able to listen to and answer customers who call the council with queries.

2,2024-08-01 15:05:46.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 13:05:36.000,How a refugee Olympian found a new life in Canada,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crg4vr7kyq5o,2024-07-31 23:07:53.000,"Nigara Shaheen’s journey to becoming an Olympic judoka did not begin with judo. Instead, it began with a 30-minute karate lesson on her family’s balcony in Peshawar, Pakistan. She was 11 years old and had already been a refugee for most of her young life, having fled her native Afghanistan in 1993 with her parents as an infant, her mother carrying her as they walked two days and nights through the mountains to safety. She has faced many more obstacles to fight in the sport she loves, in between her first-ever karate lesson and competing in the Paris Olympics as part of the Refugee Olympic Team. Since 2022, the 31-year-old athlete has been living and training in Toronto. As a young student in Pakistan, Ms Shaheen faced harassment by older men on her way to the refugee school she attended, and bullying by her peers. In an essay in the Toronto Life magazine, she recalled: ""One day, an older man assaulted me and my sister. He screamed at us and pushed me to the ground. I wanted to punch and beat him, but I didn’t know how."" Her mother said she needed to learn how to defend herself. The school she attended didn't offer martial arts or other after-school activities for students - even if it had, it would often close, sometimes for weeks at a time, she told the BBC in an interview from Paris. But through her extended family, she heard about an instructor who was coaching karate at a nearby school. He couldn't train her there, but he could come to her. Soon after, Ms Shaheen was on the balcony at her aunt's home, getting coached. Her mother told her the balcony was all the family had to offer “but you can use it as much as you want”, she recalled. Not long after, Ms Shaheen was fighting in local karate tournaments. Her coach, noticing her talent and passion, suggested she try competing in judo. “I asked him ‘what’s judo? And how would I know what to do?’ He told me: ‘Just grab your opponent and throw her, that’s it,’” she said. Ms Shaheen was able to take down her first opponent in a few seconds. She had a knack for the sport. While winning felt good, it was the philosophy of judo that got her hooked. “(My first coach) said you will not learn how to get up unless you fall. As a kid, that really motivated me,” she said. It also reminded her of watching the WWE with her father, a wrestling fan, as a child. The sport gave her the confidence to find herself - and joy in her life - despite the hardships she faced as a refugee. Ms Shaheen’s coaches began to notice her talent. At one point she trained with Pakistan’s national judo team but could not compete alongside them without a Pakistani passport. In 2014, Ms Shaheen returned to Afghanistan, where she studied political science and public administration at the American University in Kabul. She also trained with the Afghani national team, were she was welcomed by her male colleagues. ""Inside the gym, we were a family, and they treated me like I was their sister,"" she wrote in Toronto Life. She continued to train and compete, and began to receive a lot of attention as a female athlete in Afghanistan - some of it unwanted. “I faced immense cyber bullying,” she told the BBC. The harassment later turned physical. “There were so many times when cars would chase us,” she said. Once, someone threw a soft drink can in her mother’s direction as she was dropping her off at practice. She left her home country again, in 2018. “I always say that I became a refugee for a second time,” she said. She moved to Russia for her master’s studies in international trade and entrepreneurship. But unlike the welcome she received at her gym in Afghanistan, she couldn't find a training partner in Russia. She spent the next year training alone - a time she has called ""the worst days"" of her career. In 2019, she was approached by an International Judo Federation member, who suggested she try out for the Refugee Olympic Team. She qualified for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, but a serious shoulder injury knocked her out of the competition. By then she had finished her studies in Russia and the situation in Afghanistan had deteriorated drastically. “I was just stuck,” Ms Shaheen said. She returned to Pakistan where she mostly stayed at home in fear of her safety - she had faced criticism for not wearing a headscarf during the Games - and contemplated her next steps. That’s when the opportunity to live and train in Canada opened up, with the help of the Olympic Refugee Foundation and United Nations Refugee Agency. Ms Shaheen was accepted to study in Toronto for a postgraduate degree in international development. She arrived in September 2022 - a bittersweet moment for the athlete who had already journeyed through three countries in search of stability. It was in that Canadian city where her judo career was given a new lease on life. “I was so happy to finally be at a place where I can be myself,” she said. “But it was also hard for me because I had to say goodbye to my parents for the second time.” In Paris, she is one of the 37 athletes playing for the Refugee Olympic Team - a team Ms Shaheen is grateful to be a part of. “I feel really proud,” she said ahead of her first competition on Tuesday against Mexico’s Prisca Awiti Alcaraz. “I’m as much of an Afghan as I am a refugee,” she said. The banner for the refugee team is “a flag that I can relate to”. While she lost to Ms Alcaraz, Ms Shaheen has said that she is thankful to be able to compete at the highest level. ""Even with every loss, I learn something new."" She will appear on the mat once again on Saturday, where she will represent the Refugee Olympic Team in the mixed team event - her first time doing so. ""Team events are more exciting since I always look at my teammates and feel like I can’t let them down so I fight for all of them,"" she told the International Judo Federation ahead of the competition. After the games, Ms Shaheen plans to call Canada home - she is now a permanent resident - and she hopes to one day work to assist refugees like herself. Her parents are still in Pakistan, where they are cheering her on as she lives out her Olympic dream. At her lowest points, she said she would lean on her family for support. “My sister used to tell me, ‘I trust that one day you will achieve something big, and this will be a memory and you will laugh about this.’” “Now is the time that I laugh about it.” Great Britain's Ben Maher completes a ""perfect"" clearance in the equestrian team jumping qualifier at Paris 2024.

2,2024-08-01 15:05:46.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 13:05:36.000,Can technology fix the 'broken' concert ticketing system?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cml2p8nvzp9o,2024-07-31 23:05:57.000,"For Nashville native Jacki Thrapp flying to Europe this summer to see her idol Taylor Swift perform live was a “no brainer”. With the cheapest tickets for the remaining US dates of Swift’s continuing Eras Tour now costing $2,500 (£2,000) on the resale market, up from their face value of $49, some American fans realised that it would be cheaper for them to fly across the Atlantic to catch one of the European shows instead. So back in May, Jacki went to see Swift perform twice in Sweden, with each ticket costing her less than $200. “Americans are paying so much money, and a lot of Taylor Swift fans are people in their 20s and 30s,” says the 32-year-old. “We're paying so much money to see her in the US when a lot of us still can't even afford a house.” Although Jacki bought two Swedish tickets on the secondary market, the mark-up of the most expensive was only around double its face value. This is said to be because buying resold tickets is not an established thing to do in Sweden, unlike in the US and UK. In other European countries, such as Germany, tickets cannot be resold at more than 25% above their face value. Meanwhile, some nations go even further. Italy, Portugal and the Republic of Ireland all have laws in place that prevent concert tickets being sold above their original price. In the UK and the US the price of re-sold tickets can currently be as high as people are willing to pay. In April, 250 musical artists, including Billie Eilish and Cyndi Lauper, signed an open letter that attacked ""predatory resellers"", and called the current ticking system ""broken"". The situation may change for the better in the UK in the next few years, as the Labour Party, which forms the new government, said in March that it planned to cap the resale price of tickets. Yet laws preventing excessive pricing on the secondary market do not stop two key issues – touts getting their hands on excessive amounts of tickets in the first instance, and the risk of people buying counterfeit tickets or being scammed. The latter is said to have affected hundreds of Taylor Swift fans who tried to buy tickets for her concerts in the UK this summer. Asher Weiss, chief executive of ticketing start-up Tixologi, believes that technology is the solution, particularly AI. “People [touts] will buy a ticket and list it on multiple marketplaces for secondary sale,” he says. “And then even if it sells on one, they won't take it down off the other one. “So multiple people end up with the same ticket, trying to get in,” explains Mr Weiss, whose firm is based in Los Angeles. To prevent people buying excessive numbers of tickets, he says that Tixologi’s AI “will be able to flag people making multiple purchases from the same IP address as unusual purchasing behaviour”. “That would prevent those bad actors, and protect the true fans and customers,” adds Mr Weiss. His firm is also able to ensure that only one copy of a ticket can ever exist. It does this by using blockchain, the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies. This prevents duplication. Tixologi’s electronic tickets also have a rotating QR code that is said to be extremely difficult to copy, so that fake ones are instantly spotted when scanned. And a venue or artist can select a function called “disable transfers”, which prevents a user from emailing the ticket to someone else. This makes them much harder to re-sell. UK ticketing company Seat Unique is working with London’s Wembley Stadium to sell hospitality tickets for Taylor Swift’s tour. She returns to the stadium for five shows in August, following three there in June. “It is probably the most popular event I’ve seen in 15 years,” says Robin Sherry, Seat Unique’s founder and chief executive. The company specializes in allowing venues and artists to sell their tickets via dynamic pricing. What this means is that the price is allowed to go up, and down, according to demand. The idea is that the venue and artists sell the tickets directly, and therefore get the additional income if prices rise, instead of that money going to sellers on the secondary market. To set the dynamic price Seat Unique is now using AI to constantly monitor demand and automatically respond to it. “It’s ultimately about keeping tickets in the hands of fans not scalpers,” says Mr Sherry, who also works with sports clubs and organisations. He adds that AI also has the ability to transform the marketing of concerts and other events, with adverts specifically targeted at individuals based on learning what they are interested in. “I always jokingly say, AI will know what events you want to go to before I do,” he adds, saying that this will be “revolutionary in an industry that has been slow to modernise”. While AI is starting to change how we are able buy tickets to concerts and other events, it is also beginning to appear on the stage. In November a new AI-powered hologram of Elvis Presley will be performing live in London. The creator of the Elvis Evolution production, Andrew McGuiness, says the hologram is so lifelike that it will be “less like Abba Voyage and more like time travel”. But whether AI will be the answer for fans like Jacki Thrapp remains to be seen. ""This was the first time I've ever left America to see one of my favourite artists, but there has to be a better way to do this,” she says. Both Seat Unique and Tixologi hope that better way will be delivered by advances in AI. A faulty update by the cyber-security firm last month caused chaos around the world. The two companies say they will offer drivers financial incentives to switch to electric cars. Sales of Instagram and Facebook adverts have soared, delivering a surge in profits for parent company Meta. The central bank has put up its key rate to ""around 0.25%"" as it tries to ease rising prices. Singapore officials say they are investigating the incident, which hospitalised 57 people.

2,2024-08-01 15:05:46.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 13:05:36.000,The Mexican women aiding migrants on their perilous journey north,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c720vye08y9o,2024-08-01 00:21:25.000,"Few people know how perilous the migrant journey across Mexico has become in recent months better than a group of women in the eastern state of Veracruz, known as Las Patronas. For the past 30 years, as policies towards Central American migrants have hardened on both sides of the Rio Grande, they have unfailingly kept up the same humanitarian gesture to the migrants who pass through their village. Every day, Las Patronas bag up rice, beans, tortillas, bread, tins of tuna and bottles of water. As the freight train known as La Bestia, meaning The Beast, approaches, they scramble to the side of the tracks and hold out the food for the migrants travelling on its roofs to grab as they thunder past. “Gracias! God bless you!” the migrants yell over the deafening noise of the train as it clatters north, a fleeting moment of kindness on what is one of the most dangerous migrant journeys in the world. Many will struggle to make it much further north. This year, Mexico has stopped around three times as many migrants who have crossed into its territory from Central America as it did a year ago. While the 280,000 interdictions a month by the Mexican authorities have won approval in Washington, they have made life unbearable for those on the road. “The dream that many call the American Dream has turned into a nightmare”, reflects Norma Romero, the founder of Las Patronas. Mexico and the United States are at a pivotal point in their relationship. Mexico has just chosen its first woman president, Claudia Sheinbaum, who will take office in October. The United States, meanwhile, is heading full steam into its election campaign with possibly its first female president in Kamala Harris, or a second Trump presidency on the horizon. Neither scenario gives Norma much cause for optimism. “I never put my faith in politics. Rather, I believe in ordinary people who bring about change and who have different ways of thinking,” she says, as her fellow volunteers chop vegetables to flavour the rice. Nor does she think having a woman at the helm will make any difference in terms of tackling the widespread abuses of migrants in Mexico. “Sadly, politics hasn't improved since, well, as long as I can remember. Really, there’s never been any change that has brought any benefit to migrants.” I first met Norma a decade ago when, as she showed the BBC, the freight trains were heaving with migrants fleeing violence and hardship in their home countries for the prospect of a better life in the United States. Successive Mexican governments tended not to stop people heading north if they were simply passing through. In the United States, undocumented immigration was not the polarising electoral topic that it has since become. Today, that attitude has noticeably changed. Particularly in US border states, it is the leading issue heading into November’s vote. In June, President Joe Biden issued an executive order which grants US Border Patrol the right to deport people who have crossed into the US illegally without processing their asylum-requests. In the first four weeks of the new policy, there was a 40% reduction in detentions on the US southern border. Norma says Las Patronas have seen noticeably emptier trains in recent weeks – sometimes without any migrants on them at all. She thinks the migrants are using other routes, by bus or on foot. But, she says, they remain woefully uninformed about such US policy developments or the extent of the obstacles they face on the road: “The migrants don't have the basic knowledge they need about what is involved in travelling through Mexico,” she laments. “We see what’s happening to them and try to think about their wellbeing as human beings.” Las Patronas also run a shelter where weary migrants can get a hot meal, a bed, bathe, wash their clothes and receive medical attention. Among those staying for a few days to rest and gather their strength is Guadalupe, a Salvadoran migrant travelling with her 17-year-old daughter Nicole. She says they won’t travel on La Bestia again, having twice been taken off the freight train by immigration officers. The experience, she recalls, was brutal. “They hit a lot of people who were with us and gave others electric shocks with tasers. They almost tasered me too. That was the worst experience we’ve had here in Mexico.” Given the threat of kidnappings, sexual abuse and extortion by the country’s drug cartels, traversing Mexico is one of the most fraught parts of a journey which, for some, began in the Andes or the Caribbean. Often though, says Guadalupe, they’re extorted by migration and security officials, the very men and women charged with upholding the law in Mexico. “Once they take us off the train, many migration officers demand bribes from us. If we have enough money, we can pass. This time, we didn’t, and they sent us back to the border with Guatemala. That was the hardest thing.” Mexican law enforcement has undoubtedly kept down the numbers of migrants reaching the US’s door. “There is no crisis in migration at present,” said Mexico's President, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, recently as he urged the US to bolster development aid to Central America to dissuade people from leaving home in the first place. Rather than outright deportations – Mexico only sent back around 8,500 people in the first three months of this year – the Mexican authorities have been employing a form of ‘internal removal’ instead. Thousands of detained migrants have been dropped in towns on the border with Guatemala, some 2,000 kilometres from the US border. The strategy saps the migrants of the funds and energy they need to keep going. Salvadoran migrant, Guadalupe, likens the tactic to a giant game of snakes and ladders: “It’s very similar. Just like the board game, you have to avoid stepping on the snakes or you’re back to square one. It’s the same here too. If we don’t hide or run faster than the immigration agents, then our journey ends and we’re sent all the way back to the start.” The BBC repeatedly requested an interview with the Mexican government over undocumented immigration, but no-one was made available. As another train approaches, Guadalupe helps Norma Romero and the other women to take the food down to the tracks. No matter who wins in the US, or what their relationship with President-elect Sheinbaum, Norma says Las Patronas won’t turn off their stoves as long as migrants keep coming past.

Follow the latest business news here or read through the updates below. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm, slashed Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink’s pay by 30% to $25.2 million for 2022, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The move comes after the money manager reported first-quarter revenue that was down 10% from a year ago, as rising interest rates and economic uncertainty impacted the firm’s bottom line. “With respect to 2022 compensation, management determined to reduce the impact of the firm’s decline in profitability on BlackRock’s broader employee population by concentrating the downward adjustments to total incentive awards toward senior management,” the filing said. Total compensation for Fink, 70, included a base salary of $1.5 million and $23.7 million in total incentive awards. Several other executives saw their compensation reduced, including Rob Kapito, the firm’s president, whose package shrank by 34% to $18.95 million. UBS’ purchase of Credit Suisse’s US subsidiaries can move forward, the Federal Reserve said Friday. The statement comes a month after UBS stepped in to rescue the embattled Swiss lender and prevent turmoil in the financial sector from spreading, after an emergency loan of nearly $54 billion from the Swiss National Bank failed to stop the carnage. The problems for Credit Suisse began when the Saudi National Bank, its largest backer, said it wouldn’t put up more cash after buying a nearly 10% stake in the bank for $1.5 billion in 2022. Banking customers were already on edge after the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank — so Credit Suisse shares tumbled more than 25% and saw billions of dollars of outflows. The global turmoil has led US lawmakers to call for tighter regulations on banks. The Fed board said UBS will provide a quarterly updated plan for combining UBS’s and Credit Suisse’s US business and operations. “The implementation plan will address UBS’s obligations to comply with more stringent enhanced prudential standards, including liquidity standards,” the Fed said in a statement. UBS is shelling out 3 billion Swiss francs, or $3.25 billion, for Credit Suisse. Stocks slid Friday after a slate of earnings beats from big banks fueled concerns that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its next two meetings. Still, the major indices gained for the week. The Dow rose 400 points, or 1.2%. The S&P 500 gained 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.3%. JPMorgan Chase on Friday reported first-quarter profit and revenue that crushed expectations, boosted by the Fed’s interest rate hiking campaign. Citigroup, Wells Fargo and PNC Financial also reported strong results. CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors in the company’s post-earnings conference call that they should prepare for interest rates to be higher for longer than expected. Wall Street seems to have taken note. Analysts increased their bets on a quarter-point rate hike at the Fed’s meeting in May and another in June. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Friday that the central bank needs to continue tightening monetary policy, further weighing down markets. Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said that it’s “definitely” possible the United States enters a mild recession after the tumult in banking last month. Meanwhile, retail sales data declined more than expected, suggesting that Americans’ spending power and the US economy are weakening. Consumer sentiment held fairly steady in April, even as concerns about a recession linger, according to the University of Michigan’s latest monthly survey. “There was too much news to digest this morning, but the key takeaway is that the Fed has room to do more harm,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, said in a note. The Dow slipped 144 points, or 0.4%. The S&P 500 tumbled 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite sank 0.4%. As stocks settle after the trading day, levels might still change slightly. Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said Friday he isn’t discounting the recent assessment from central bank economists that the banking crisis will tip the United States into a mild recession later this year. “There’s no way you can look at current conditions around the world and in the US and not think that some mild recession is definitely on the table as a possibility,” Goolsbee said Friday during an interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” He added that, when viewed historically, the monetary tightening campaign undertaken by the Fed — hiking interest rates nine times in just over a year — is expected to slow GDP growth. “When you get numbers like retail sales and others that are declining, if you look at construction, I think we’ve got to think about what’s the state of growth in the country,” he said. “Fortunately, the labor market continues to be very strong.” Critics have lambasted the World Bank and, particularly, the International Monetary Fund, for predicting Russia’s economy would hold relatively stable this year despite international sanctions. But sanctions are hurting Russia’s economy, even if World Bank forecasts don’t reflect it, according to the outgoing World Bank President David Malpass. Speaking to Julia Chatterley at the IMF-World Bank spring conference, David Malpass responded to criticism that you couldn’t trust GDP and economic data from Russia. He admitted “the quality of the data differs substantially by country…the reality is there’s not very much in terms of double checking of data”. In January, the IMF projected that Russia’s economy would expand by 0.3% this year and 2.1% the next. That was much more optimistic than the latest forecasts from the World Bank, which still penciled in a contraction of just 3.3% this year. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development was the most pessimistic, forecasting a 5.6% contraction in Russia’s economy in 2023. Malpass said that GDP numbers were not capturing the “reality” and “horror” of the war, and noted the Russian economy was suffering. “I think life is hard in Russia…they’re excluded from travelling to many parts of the world, their supply chains have to change dramatically… young people moving out because they don’t want to be part of this war,” Malpass said. Consumer sentiment tracked by the University of Michigan held steady in April, according to a preliminary reading released Friday. So far, the university’s monthly surveys have shown a limited impact from the banking crisis on consumers’ attitudes, but Americans remain concerned about an upcoming recession and some lingering fears about inflation persist. “Consumers are expecting a downturn, they’re not feeling as dismal as they were last summer, but they’re waiting for the other shoe to drop,” said Joanne Hsu, director of the surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan, in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Friday morning. “We now have about a month of data following the collapse of SVB, and there hasn’t really been much of an effect on sentiment at all,” she said. The latest survey also showed that higher gas prices helped push up year-ahead inflation expectations by a full percentage point, rising from 3.6% in March to 4.6% in April. “Consumers are still feeling the pain of high prices,” Hsu told Bloomberg, noting that survey respondents were now mentioning gas prices for the first time since fall. The latest cooldown in consumer and producer price hikes as well as the latest decline in retail sales are indications that the Federal Reserve’s efforts are working to bring down high inflation, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee told CNBC on Friday. “You don’t want to overreact to short-run news, but it feel likes like that’s moving in the right direction,” he said during an appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” Goolsbee was quick to note that an area of critical importance to him in advance of the next Fed meeting is activity in banking and credit. Earlier this week, Goolsbee noted that the Fed needs to be “on watch” for tighter credit conditions as a result of the banking turmoil last month. He referenced private sector analyst estimates that the spillover effects of the crisis equate to the Fed enacting rate hikes anywhere from a quarter point to three-quarters of a point. “I’m an old-school data dog,” Goolsbee said Friday. “What I would do is spend the next three weeks getting out and figuring out how much credit tightening is coming.” Chief executives at some of the largest banks in the United States were forced to address the elephant in the room as they reported first-quarter earnings on Friday morning: The regional banking crisis that brought Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank to ruin last month. > Banking industry turmoil has added to risks of recessionary “storm clouds” on the horizon, said JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon Friday in a release. He added that “the banking situation is distinct from 2008 as it has involved far fewer financial players and fewer issues that need to be resolved.” Still, said Dimon, who leads the country’s largest bank, “financial conditions will likely tighten as lenders become more conservative, and we do not know if this will slow consumer spending.” >“We are glad to have been in a strong position to help support the US financial system during the recent events that impacted the banking industry,” commented Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf in a statement. “Regional and community banks are an important part of our financial system and are uniquely positioned to serve their customers and communities.” > “I believe today’s crisis of confidence in the regional banking sector will further accelerate capital markets growth, and BlackRock will be a central player,” wrote BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on Friday. “Increased financing through the capital markets will require the scale, multi-asset capabilities and excellence in portfolio construction that BlackRock consistently delivers across market cycles,” he said in a statement. That means bad news for regional banks could be good news for BlackRock – the lack of trust in regional banks will drive more investment into capital markets and BlackRock is poised to benefit as that happens. “Throughout our history, moments of market dislocation and disruption have served as inflection points for BlackRock,” he explained. Regulators also hired BlackRock in early April to help the US government in the sale of the $114 billion in assets it collected from the collapse> Citigroup and PNC did not address the banking crisis in their releases, but will likely answer questions about how they’ve weathered the turmoil and what they see ahead at their first-quarter presentations, planned for 11 a.m. ET. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors Friday not to be caught unawares if interest rates stay higher longer than expected. “People need to be prepared. They shouldn’t pray that they don’t go up. They should prepare for them going up. And if it doesn’t happen, serendipity,” Dimon said on the company’s post-earnings conference call. High interest rates have helped big banks, including JPMorgan Chase, since they widen the gap between the interest paid to customers and what they earn from investing that money. But climbing rates also helped drive last month’s collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which held 55% of its customers deposits in long-dated bonds whose value diminished as interest rates rose. Dimon stated that he believes the banking crisis will pass — even though he expects its effects to reverberate through the sector for years to come — but that the possibility of higher interest rates should remain on companies’ radars. “If and when that happens, it will address problems in the economy. For those who are too exposed to floating rates, or those who are too exposed to [refinancing] risk, those exposures will be in multiple parts of the economy,” Dimon said. “Now would be the time to fix it. Do not put yourself in a position where that risk is excessive for your company, your business, your investment pools,” he said. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the largest US bank, told investors Friday that he isn’t too worried about a credit crunch resulting from the recent banking crisis. “I wouldn’t use the word[s] ‘credit crunch,’” he said in response to a question about whether he was worried that lending would tighten in the bank after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. There will be “a little bit of tightening,” said Dimon, but that will mostly be contained within the real estate market. Dimon added that he’s more worried about recession than a credit crunch. “I just look at it as a kind of a thumb on the scale. It just makes the financing conditions a little bit tighter and increases the odds of a recession,” he said. “That’s what that is. It’s not like a credit crunch.” JPMorgan Chase said Friday its exposure to the office sector is limited, addressing concerns about the commercial real estate industry’s stability. “Given the recent focus on commercial real estate, let me remind you that our office sector exposure is less than 10% of our portfolio and is focused in urban dense markets, and nearly two-thirds of our loans are multifamily, primarily in supply-constrained markets,” said Jeremy Barnum, chief financial officer, in the company’s post-earnings conference call. Investors and regulators are watching the $20 trillion US commercial real estate market for signs that it could be the next shoe to drop after the banking tumult last month. That’s partly because the value of buildings is going down, particularly as offices in major cities remain vacant or half-empty as Americans opt to work from home. The commercial real estate industry’s woes come after decades of unbridled growth powered by low interest rates and easy credit. That upward trend was interrupted by the Covid pandemic’s onset, and then when the Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates aggressively last year to stabilize the economy. “There are obviously some big things here and there to pay attention to, but in the scheme of things for us, not a big issue,” Barnum said. Spending at US retailers fell in March as consumers pulled back amid recessionary fears fueled by the banking crisis. Retail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation, fell by 1% in March from the prior month, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. That was steeper than an expected 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv, and above the revised 0.2% decline in the prior month. The drop was driven by a pullback in spending at department stores and on durable goods such as appliances and furniture. Spending at general merchandise stores fell 3% in March from the prior month and spending at gas stations declined 5.5% during the same period. Excluding gas station sales, retail spending retreated 0.6% in March from February. However, year-on-year retail spending rose 2.9%. Citigroup shares were up about 0.8% in premarket trading after the bank posted strong first-quarter profits, beating analyst expectations for both earnings per share and revenue. The bank brought in $21.4 billion in revenue versus expectations of $19.9 billion. Earnings per share were $2.19, estimates were for $1.67. Citi CEO Jane Fraser and CFO Mark Mason will hold an earnings presentation at 11 a.m. ET. Stocks slid Friday, even as big banks reported beats on their first-quarter earnings in an auspicious start to earnings season. Investors were watching for clues about the financial sector’s stability, and whether the tumult in the sector last month could lead to tighter lending standards. A key point of interest was also how much big banks benefitted from increased deposit inflows when nervous customers fled from regional banks after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. JPMorgan, the largest bank in the United States and an economic bellwether, posted record revenue. Wells Fargo, Citigroup and PNC Financial Services also reported earnings beats. Shares of JPMorgan Chase gained 4.8%, Wells Fargo rose 0.7%, Citigroup added 1.9% and PNC Financial Services ticked up 0.3%. Meanwhile, retail sales came in weaker than expected as recession fears loom. Retail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation, fell by 1% in March from the month before, according to the Commerce Department. Economists expected a 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv. The Dow fell 38 points, or about 0.1%. The S&P 500 sank 0.1%. The Nasdaq Composite declined 0.5%. The Federal Reserve could end its historic rate-hiking campaign after just one more quarter-point increase, said Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic in a Thursday interview with Reuters. The Fed has approved nine rate hikes in a row since last March, the effects of which are only now starting to “bite,” Bostic said. Monetary policy can take months to trickle through the economy, but a slew of recent data suggests that inflation is finally cooling. The March Consumer Price Index shows price hikes have slowed for nine months in a row, and headline wholesale inflation reflected in the Producer Price Index has sunk to 2.7% after reaching double digit highs last year. Bostic said the recent “chaos” in the banking sector, after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, persuaded him to rethink the pace of rate hikes. However, he told Reuters he believes the turmoil will not have any lasting impact on the the US economy. Analysts expect the Fed to raise rates by a quarter point at its upcoming policy meeting on May 2-3, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Regional bank PNC Financial reported first-quarter revenue of $5.6 billion and earnings per share of $3.98 vs. expectations of $3.66. Shares rose 5% on the news. Wells Fargo reported first-quarter revenue of $20.7 billion against expectations of $20.1 billion. The San Francisco-based bank saw earnings of $4.9 billion, up from $3.8 billion a year earlier, an increase of about 32%. Shares of Wells Fargo rose 2.2%. JPMorgan Chase on Friday reported first-quarter profit and revenue that roundly beat expectations, boosted by a year of rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. The New York-based bank posted a profit of $12.6 billion or $4.10 per share. That’s up from $8.3 billion, or $2.63 per share from the same period a year before. Analysts expected earnings of $3.41 per share, according to Refinitiv. With $3.67 trillion in assets, JPMorgan Chase is the largest bank in the United States and a bellwether for the US economy. “The US economy continues to be on generally healthy footings — consumers are still spending and have strong balance sheets, and businesses are in good shape. However, the storm clouds that we have been monitoring for the past year remain on the horizon,” CEO Jamie Dimon said in a press release. Net interest income rose to $20.8 billion, up 49% from the prior year, driven by the aggressive interest rate campaign the Fed kicked off last year to stabilize prices. Deposits rose to $2.38 trillion during the first quarter from $2.34 trillion in the quarter ended in December. That comes after the banking tumult last month triggered a rush into big banks from nervous customers. Investors also looked to money market funds as a haven. A key point of conversation after last month’s turmoil in the banking sector has been whether banks could tighten lending standards, leading customers to spend less as it becomes more difficult to borrow money for large purchases like homes and cars. “Financial conditions will likely tighten as lenders become more conservative, and we do not know if this will slow consumer spending,” Dimon said, adding that JPMorgan Chase is “confident that we can serve the needs of our customers and clients in all environments.” Shares of JPMorgan Chase climbed 6.1% in pre-market trading. The company’s post-earnings conference call is slated for 8:30 a.m. ET. Stocks: US stock futures fell ahead of several bank earnings this morning. Investors also fretted a retail sales report that is expected to show consumers are pulling back on their spending. Dow futures were down 75 points, or 0.2%. S&P 500 futures fell 0.2%. Nasdaq futures were 0.4% lower. European stocks were higher and Asian stocks closed up. Fear & Greed Index: 67 = Greed Oil & gas: US oil prices were up 0.3% to $82 a barrel. Average US gas prices rose to $3.66 a gallon. Wall Street is searching for answers to two key questions: Is the economy headed for a recession? And, if so, who’s poised to weather it? Recession fears have ramped up in recent weeks after the banking tumult last month raised concerns about the financial sector’s health. Earnings season for banks starts on Friday with JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, BlackRock, Citigroup and PNC Financial Services slated to report before the bell. Investors will be watching for clues about stability. Stocks have yet to price in the economy’s precarious position, with the S&P 500 adding about 7% this year. But markets have already seen volatile trading since then. “We’re going to see a correction happen here, because it just never makes sense when the market’s going up and earnings are going down,” says Eric Sterner, chief investment officer at Apollon Wealth Management. But while earnings are an undeniable factor driving markets, inflation remains a key concern. Wall Street remains overly optimistic that the Fed will cut rates later this year — even after officials indicated last month that they likely won’t — or that it could even orchestrate a soft landing. That hope, and the market’s resilience, could start to crumble in the next few weeks, said Megan Horneman, chief investment officer at Verdence Capital Advisors. “You very well could see that catalyst over the next couple of weeks with earnings, and then this inflation data and then what the Fed says when they meet,” said Horneman. Jeremy Grantham made his name predicting the dot-com crash in 2000 and the financial crisis in 2008. Now, the famous investor warns another epic bubble in financial markets is bursting — and the turmoil that swept through the banking sector last month is just the beginning. “Other things will break, and who knows what they will be,” Grantham told CNN in an exclusive interview. “We’re by no means finished with the stress to the financial system.” Since early 2022, when the S&P 500 hit an all-time high, US stocks have dropped about 15% as central banks have jacked up borrowing costs. But Grantham sees much steeper declines on the horizon. The “best we can hope for,” he said, is a fall of about 27% from current levels, while the worst-case scenario would see a plunge of more than 50%. The low point might not arrive until “deep into next year,” he added. Grantham sees uncomfortable parallels between markets today and 2000, when an explosion in the price of tech stocks was followed by a dizzying crash. There are also echoes of 2008, when a painful comedown in the US housing market almost broke the banking system. What’s even more worrying is that this time, bubbles in the stock market and the real estate market are poised to burst simultaneously, Grantham said. The broader US banking system remains sound and stable, but the two regional banks that failed were “poorly managed” and “took unacceptable risks,” White House economic adviser Lael Brainard told CNN’s Poppy Harlow in an interview Wednesday at Semafor’s World Economy Summit in Washington, DC. Last month’s collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank roiled markets and spread fear through the economy of a possible wider banking crisis. The US Treasury, Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation all intervened to ensure bank customers could access all their money and to attempt to stave off future bank runs. “The banking system, it’s very sound, it’s stable; the core of the banking system has a great deal of capital that was put in place in the wake of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis,” said Brainard, director of the White House National Economic Council. “There were some banks who were not managing their risks effectively. They failed, and the president took strong actions along with the Secretary of the Treasury and the banking regulators,” she said. “Those actions reassured Americans their deposits are safe, the banking system is sound; but it was also important to the president that the executives of those failed banks were held accountable and, very important, that taxpayer money not be at risk,” she continued. Before its collapse last month, Silicon Valley Bank was known to investors of color as a place that fostered a community of minority entrepreneurs and provided them with both social and financial capital. SVB regularly sponsored conferences and networking events for minority entrepreneurs, and it was well known for funding the annual State of Black Venture Report spearheaded by BLK VC, a nonprofit organization that connects and empowers Black investors. “When other banks were saying no, SVB would say yes,” said Joynicole Martinez, a 25-year entrepreneur and chief advancement and innovation officer for Rising Tide Capital, a nonprofit organization founded in 2004 to connect entrepreneurs with investors and mentors. Minority business owners have long faced challenges accessing capital due to discriminatory lending practices, experts say. Data from the Small Business Credit Survey, a collaboration of all 12 Federal Reserve banks, shows disparities on denial rates for bank and nonbank loans. In 2021, about 16% of Black-led companies acquired the total amount of business financing they sought from banks, compared to 35% of White-owned companies, the survey shows. “We know there’s historic, systemic, and just blatant racism that’s inherent in lending and banking. We have to start there and not tip-toe around it,” Martinez told CNN. The Financial Services Forum, an organization representing the eight largest financial institutions in the United States has said banks have committed millions of dollars since 2020 to address economic and racial inequality.

1,2024-08-01 15:13:49.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-01 13:06:38.000,Still haven't filed your taxes? Here's what you need to know,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/13/success/tax-filing-tips/index.html,2023-04-14 20:07:40.000,"Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks So far this tax season, the IRS has received more than 100 million income tax returns for 2022. That means tens of millions of households have yet to file their returns. If yours is among them, here are some last-minute tax-filing tips to keep in mind as the Tuesday, April 18 deadline approaches. Not everyone has to file on April 18: If you live in a federally declared disaster area, have a business there — or have relevant tax documents stored by businesses in that area — it’s likely the IRS has already extended the filing and payment deadlines for you. Here is where you can find the specific extension dates for each disaster area. Thanks to many rounds of extreme weather in recent months, for instance, tax filers in most of California — which accounts for 10% to 15% of all federal filers — have already been granted an extension until Oct. 16 to file and to pay, according to an IRS spokesperson. If you’re in the armed forces and are currently or were recently stationed in a combat zone, the filing and payment deadlines for your 2022 taxes are most likely extended by 180 days. But your specific extended filing and payment deadlines will depend on the day you leave (or left) the combat zone. This IRS publication offers more detail. Taxes and adulting: What to know about filing taxes on your own for the first time Lastly, if you made little to no money last year (typically less than $12,950 for single filers and $25,900 for married couples), you may not be required to file a return. But you may want to anyway if you think you are eligible for a refund thanks to, for instance, refundable tax credits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit. (Use this IRS tool to gauge whether you are required to file this year.) You also are likely eligible to use IRS Free File (intended for those with adjusted gross income of $73,000 or less) so it won’t cost you to submit a return. Your paycheck may not be your only source of income: If you had one full-time job you may think that is the only income you made and have to report. But that’s not necessarily so. Other potentially taxable and reportable income sources include: Organize your tax documents: By now you should have received every tax document that third parties are required to send you (your employer, bank, brokerage, etc.). If you don’t recall receiving a hard copy of a tax form in the mail, check your email and your online accounts — a document may have been sent to you electronically. Here are some of the tax forms you may have received: “Be aware that there’s no form for some taxable income, like proceeds from renting out your vacation property, meaning you’re responsible for reporting it on your own,” according to the Illinois CPA Society. One very last-minute way to reduce your 2022 tax bill: If you’re eligible to make a tax-deductible contribution to an IRA and haven’t done so for last year, you have until April 18 to contribute up to $6,000 ($7,000 if you’re 50 or older). That will reduce your tax bill and augment your retirement savings. Proofread your return before submitting it: Do this whether you’re using tax software or working with a professional tax preparer. Little mistakes and oversights delay the processing of your return (and the issuance of your refund if you’re owed one). You want to avoid things like having a typo in your name, birth date, Social Security number or direct deposit number; choosing the wrong filing status (e.g., married vs single); making a simple math error; or leaving a required field blank. What to do if you can’t file by April 18: If you’re not able to file by next Tuesday, fill out Form 4868 electronically or on paper and send it in by April 18. You will be granted an automatic six-month extension to file. Your tax refund may be smaller this year. Here's why Note, however, that an extension to file is not an extension to pay. You will be charged interest (currently running at 7%) and a penalty on any amount you still owe for 2022 but haven’t paid by April 18. So if you suspect you still owe tax — perhaps you had some income outside of your job for which tax wasn’t withheld or you had a big capital gain last year — approximate how much more you owe and send that money to the IRS by Tuesday. You can choose to do so by mail, attaching a check to your extension request form. Make sure your envelope is postmarked no later than April 18. Or the more efficient route is pay what you owe electronically at IRS.gov, said CPA Damien Martin, a tax partner at EY. If you do that, the IRS notes you will not have to file a Form 4868. “The IRS will automatically process an extension of time to file,” the agency notes in its instructions. If you opt to electronically pay directly from your bank account, which is free, select “extension” and then “tax year 2022” when given the option. You can also pay by credit or debit card, but you will be charged a processing fee. Doing so, though, may become much more costly than just a fee if you charge your tax payment but don’t pay your credit card bill off in full every month, since you likely pay a high interest rate on outstanding balances. If you still owe income taxes to your state, remember that you may need to go through a similar exercise of filing for an extension and making a payment to your state’s revenue department, Martin said. Use this interactive tax assistant for basic questions you may have: The IRS provides an “interactive tax assistant” that can help you answer more than 50 basic questions pertaining to your individual circumstance on income, deductions, credits and other technical questions.

1,2024-08-01 15:13:49.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-01 13:06:38.000,Retail spending fell in March as consumers pull back,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/14/economy/march-retail-sales/index.html,2023-04-14 14:29:52.000,"Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Spending at US retailers fell in March as consumers pulled back after the banking crisis fueled recession fears. Retail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation, fell by 1% in March from the prior month, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. That was steeper than an expected 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv, and above the revised 0.2% decline in the prior month. Investors chalk up some of the weakness to a lack of tax returns and concerns about a slowing labor market. The IRS issued $84 billion in tax refunds this March, about $25 billion less than they issued in March of 2022, according to BofA analysts. That led consumers to pull back in spending at department stores and on durable goods, such as appliances and furniture. Spending at general merchandise stores fell 3% in March from the prior month and spending at gas stations declined 5.5% during the same period. Excluding gas station sales, retail spending retreated 0.6% in March from February. However, retail spending rose 2.9% year-over-year. Smaller tax returns likely played a role in last month’s decline in retail sales, along with the expiration of enhanced food assistance benefits, economists say. “March is a really important month for refunds. Some folks might have been expecting something similar to last year,” Aditya Bhave, senior US economist at BofA Global Research, told CNN. Credit and debit card spending per household tracked by Bank of America researchers moderated in March to its slowest pace in more than two years, which was likely the result of smaller returns and expired benefits, coupled with slowing wage growth. Enhanced pandemic-era benefits provided through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program expired in February, which might have also held back spending in March, according to a Bank of America Institute report. Average hourly earnings grew 4.2% in March from a year earlier, down from the prior month’s annualized 4.6% increase and the smallest annual rise since June 2021, according to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Employment Cost Index, a more comprehensive measure of wages, has also shown that worker pay gains have moderated this past year. ECI data for the first quarter of this year will be released later this month. Still, the US labor market remains solid, even though it has lost momentum recently. That could hold up consumer spending in the coming months, said Michelle Meyer, North America chief economist at Mastercard Economics Institute. “The big picture is still favorable for the consumer when you think about their income growth, their balance sheet and the health of the labor market,” Meyer said. Employers added 236,000 jobs in March, a robust gain by historical standards but smaller than the average monthly pace of job growth in the prior six months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The latest monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, showed that the number of available jobs remained elevated in February — but was down more than 17% from its peak of 12 million in March 2022, and revised data showed that weekly claims for US unemployment benefits were higher than previously reported. The job market could cool further in the coming months. Economists at the Federal Reserve expect the US economy to head into a recession later in the year as the lagged effects of higher interest rates take a deeper hold. Fed economists had forecast subdued growth, with risks of a recession, prior to the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. For consumers, the effects of last month’s turbulence in the banking industry have been limited so far. Consumer sentiment tracked by the University of Michigan worsened slightly in March during the bank failures, but it had already shown signs of deteriorating before then. The latest consumer sentiment reading, released Friday morning, showed that sentiment held steady in April despite the banking crisis, but that higher gas prices helped push up year-ahead inflation expectations by a full percentage point, rising from 3.6% in March to 4.6% in April. “On net, consumers did not perceive material changes in the economic environment in April,” Joanne Hsu, director of the surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan, said in a news release. “Consumers are expecting a downturn, they’re not feeling as dismal as they were last summer, but they’re waiting for the other shoe to drop,” Hsu told Bloomberg TV in an interview Friday morning.

When I watched Fox News broadcast election lies in the aftermath of the 2020 election, never did I expect the network to be held accountable in a meaningful way. I’ve covered Fox News for a while now. I’ve watched thousands and thousands of hours of the right-wing channel’s programming. I’ve seen its hosts over the years undermine public health, make gross anti-immigrant remarks, peddle lies and propaganda and push deranged conspiracy theories that were once reserved for the right-wing’s furthest fringes. The network has always seemed to find a way to sail through the controversy, even the most hellish storms it has faced. Sometimes it has emerged even stronger and more emboldened than before. But this time is different. This time, the normal tricks the network turns to during times of crisis will not free it from trouble. This time, in a court of law, the network will need to put forward an honest, fact-driven argument. Fox News is about to enter the true No Spin Zone, where deception is strictly prohibited. Where it is not in charge. And where its top executives like Rupert Murdoch and Suzanne Scott and hosts like Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity cannot simply ignore a request for comment and resort to, instead, attacking “the media” on-air. In this setting, where lies cannot be casually told and truth cannot be distorted beyond reality to fit a dishonest narrative, it will be fascinating to see how the network fares. If the pre-trial hearings are any indicator, it won’t be pretty. The case hasn’t even started and the presiding judge has already lost his patience with Fox’s legal team and put them on notice. Perhaps the winds will shift for Fox News when the judge gavels in the trial on Monday. But if they play out like the last few weeks of court have, Fox News is in for a brutal ride.

1,2024-08-01 15:13:49.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-01 13:06:38.000,Silicon Valley Bank collapse renews calls to address disparities impacting entrepreneurs of color ,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/13/business/silicon-valley-bank-entrepreneurs-of-color-reaj/index.html,2023-04-13 21:13:04.000,"Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks When customers at Silicon Valley Bank rushed to withdraw billions of dollars last month, venture capitalist Arlan Hamilton stepped in to help some of the founders of color who panicked about losing access to payroll funds. As a Black woman with nearly 10 years of business experience, Hamilton knew the options for those startup founders were limited. SVB had a reputation for servicing people from underrepresented communities like hers. Its failure has reignited concerns from industry experts about lending discrimination in the banking industry and the resulting disparities in capital for people of color. Hamilton, the 43-year-old founder and managing partner of Backstage Capital, said that when it comes to entrepreneurs of color, “we’re already in the smaller house. We already have the rickety door and the thinner walls. And so, when a tornado comes by, we’re going to get hit harder.” Established in 1983, the midsize California tech lender was America’s 16th largest bank at the end of 2022 before it collapsed on March 10. SVB provided banking services to nearly half of all venture-backed technology and life-sciences companies in the United States. Hamilton, industry experts and other investors told CNN the bank was committed to fostering a community of minority entrepreneurs and provided them with both social and financial capital. SVB regularly sponsored conferences and networking events for minority entrepreneurs, said Hamilton, and it was well known for funding the annual State of Black Venture Report spearheaded by BLK VC, a nonprofit organization that connects and empowers Black investors. “When other banks were saying no, SVB would say yes,” said Joynicole Martinez, a 25-year entrepreneur and chief advancement and innovation officer for Rising Tide Capital, a nonprofit organization founded in 2004 to connect entrepreneurs with investors and mentors. Martinez is also an official member of the Forbes Coaches Council, an invitation-only organization for business and career coaches. She said SVB was an invaluable resource for entrepreneurs of color and offered their clients discounted tech tools and research funding. Minority business owners have long faced challenges accessing capital due to discriminatory lending practices, experts say. Data from the Small Business Credit Survey, a collaboration of all 12 Federal Reserve banks, shows disparities on denial rates for bank and nonbank loans. In 2021, about 16% of Black-led companies acquired the total amount of business financing they sought from banks, compared to 35% of White-owned companies, the survey shows. “We know there’s historic, systemic, and just blatant racism that’s inherent in lending and banking. We have to start there and not tip-toe around it,” Martinez told CNN. Asya Bradley is an immigrant founder of multiple tech companies like Kinley, a financial services business aiming to help Black Americans build generational wealth. Following SVB’s collapse, Bradley said she joined a WhatsApp group of more than 1,000 immigrant business founders. Members of the group quickly mobilized to support one another, she said. Immigrant founders often don’t have Social Security numbers nor permanent addresses in the United States, Bradley said, and it was crucial to brainstorm different ways to find funding in a system that doesn’t recognize them. “The community was really special because a lot of these folks then were sharing different things that they had done to achieve success in terms of getting accounts in different places. They also were able to share different regional banks that have stood up and been like, ‘Hey, if you have accounts at SVB, we can help you guys,’” Bradley said. Many women, people of color and immigrants opt for community or regional banks like SVB, Bradley says, because they are often rejected from the “top four banks” — JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citibank. In her case, Bradley said her gender might have been an issue when she could only open a business account at one of the “top four banks” when her brother co-signed for her. “The top four don’t want our business. The top four are rejecting us consistently. The top four do not give us the service that we deserve. And that’s why we’ve gone to community banks and regional banks such as SVB,” Bradley said. None of the top four banks provided a comment to CNN. The Financial Services Forum, an organization representing the eight largest financial institutions in the United States has said the banks have committed millions of dollars since 2020 to address economic and racial inequality. Last week, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told CNN’s Poppy Harlow that his bank has 30% of its branches in lower-income neighborhoods as part of a $30 billion commitment to Black and Brown communities across the country. Wells Fargo specifically pointed to its 2022 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion report, which discusses the bank’s recent initiatives to reach underserved communities. The bank partnered last year with the Black Economic Alliance to initiate the Black Entrepreneur Fund — a $50 million seed, startup, and early-stage capital fund for businesses founded or led by Black and African American entrepreneurs. And since May 2021, Wells Fargo has invested in 13 Minority Depository Institutions, fulfilling its $50 million pledge to support Black-owned banks. Black-owned banks work to close the lending gap and foster economic empowerment in these traditionally excluded communities, but their numbers have been dwindling over the years, and they have far fewer assets at their disposal than the top banks. OneUnited Bank, the largest Black-owned bank in the United States, manages a little over $650 million in assets. By comparison, JPMorgan Chase manages $3.7 trillion in assets. Because of these disparities, entrepreneurs also seek funding from venture capitalists. In the early 2010s, Hamilton intended to start her own tech company — but as she searched for investors, she saw that White men control nearly all venture capital dollars. That experience led her to establish Backstage Capital, a venture capital fund that invests in new companies led by underrepresented founders. “I said, ‘Well, instead of trying to raise money for one company, let me try to raise for a venture fund that will invest in underrepresented — and now we call them underestimated — founders who are women, people of color, and LGBTQ specifically,’ because I am all three,” Hamilton told CNN. Since then, Backstage Capital has amassed a portfolio of nearly 150 different companies and has made over 120 diversity investments, according to data from Crunchbase. But Bradley, who is also an ‘angel investor’ of minority-owned businesses, said she remains “really hopeful” that community banks, regional banks and fintechs “will all stand up and say, ‘Hey, we are not going to let the good work of SVB go to waste.’” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

In addition to water loss due to an intense multiyear drought, the US Geological Survey and the Bureau of Reclamation report found, Lake Powell faced an average annual loss in storage capacity of about 33,270 acre-feet, or 11 billion gallons, per year between 1963 and 2018. That’s enough water to fill the Reflecting Pool on the National Mall about 1,600 times. The capacity of the reservoir is shrinking because of sediments flowing in from the Colorado and San Juan rivers, according to the report. Those sediments settle at the bottom of the reservoir and decrease the total amount of water the reservoir can hold. As of Monday, Lake Powell was around 25% full, according to data from the Bureau of Reclamation. It’s bad news for a region already facing water shortages and extreme wildfires due to the drought. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration drought experts said last week these conditions are expected to at least continue – if not worsen – in the coming months. Lake Powell is an important reservoir in the Colorado River Basin. Both Lake Powell and nearby Lake Mead, the nation’s largest reservoir, have drained at an alarming rate. In August, the federal government declared a water shortage on the Colorado River for the first time after Lake Mead’s water level plunged to unprecedented lows, triggering mandatory water consumption cuts for states in the Southwest that began in January. And last week, Lake Powell dipped below the critical threshold of 3,525 feet above sea level, sparking additional concerns about water supply and hydropower generation millions of people in the West rely on for electricity. The significance of the dwindling water supply along the Colorado cannot be overstated. The system supplies water for more than 40 million people living across seven Western states and Mexico. Lakes Powell and Mead provide a critical supply of drinking water and irrigation for many across the region, including rural farms, ranches and native communities. “It is vitally important we have the best-available scientific information like this report to provide a clear understanding of water availability in Lake Powell as we plan for the future,” Tanya Trujillo, assistant secretary for water and science with the US Department of Interior, said in a statement. “The Colorado River system faces multiple challenges, including the effects of a 22-year-long drought and the increased impacts of climate change.” © 2024 Cable News Network.

The report by IQAir, a company that tracks global air quality, found that average annual air pollution in every country — and 97% of cities — exceeded the World Health Organization’s air quality guidelines, which were designed to help governments craft regulations to protect public health. Related article Not only is Lake Powell's water level plummeting because of drought, its total capacity is shrinking, too Only 222 cities of the 6,475 analyzed had average air quality that met WHO’s standard. Three territories were found to have met WHO guidelines: the French territory of New Caledonia and the United States territories of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. India, Pakistan and Bangladesh were among the countries with the worst air pollution, exceeding the guidelines by at least 10 times. The Scandinavian countries, Australia, Canada, Japan and United Kingdom ranked among the best countries for air quality, with average levels that exceeded the guidelines by 1 to 2 times. In the United States, IQAir found air pollution exceeded WHO guidelines by 2 to 3 times in 2021. “This report underscores the need for governments around the world to help reduce global air pollution,” Glory Dolphin Hammes, CEO of IQAir North America, told CNN. “(Fine particulate matter) kills far too many people every year and governments need to set more stringent air quality national standards and explore better foreign policies that promote better air quality.” Above: IQAir analyzed average annual air quality for more than 6,000 cities and categorized them from best air quality, in blue (Meets WHO PM2.5 guildline) to worst, in purple (Exceeds WHO PM2.5 guideline by over 10 times). An interactive map is available from IQAir. It’s the first major global air quality report based on WHO’s new annual air pollution guidelines, which were updated in September 2021. The new guidelines halved the acceptable concentration of fine particulate matter — or PM 2.5 — from 10 down to 5 micrograms per cubic meter. PM 2.5 is the tiniest pollutant yet also among the most dangerous. When inhaled, it travels deep into lung tissue where it can enter the bloodstream. It comes from sources like the burning of fossil fuels, dust storms and wildfires, and has been linked to a number of health threats including asthma, heart disease and other respiratory illnesses. Related article Allergy season will start much earlier than normal and be far more intense because of climate crisis, study suggests Millions of people die each year from air quality issues. In 2016, around 4.2 million premature deaths were associated with fine particulate matter, according to WHO. If the 2021 guidelines had been applied that year, WHO found there could have been nearly 3.3 million fewer pollution-related deaths. IQAir analyzed pollution-monitoring stations in 6,475 cities across 117 countries, regions and territories. In the US, air pollution spiked in 2021 compared to 2020. Out of the more than 2,400 US cities analyzed, Los Angeles air remained the most polluted, despite seeing a 6% decrease compared to 2020. Atlanta and Minneapolis saw significant increases in pollution, the report showed. “The (United States’) reliance on fossil fuels, increasing severity of wildfires as well as varying enforcement of the Clean Air Act from administration to administration have all added to U.S. air pollution,” the authors wrote. Researchers say the main sources of pollution in the US were fossil fuel-powered transportation, energy production and wildfires, which wreak havoc on the country’s most vulnerable and marginalized communities. “We are heavily dependent on fossil fuels, especially in terms of transportation,” said Hammes, who lives a few miles from Los Angeles. “We can act smartly on this with zero emissions, but we’re still not doing it. And this is having a devastating impact on the air pollution that we’re seeing in major cities.” Related article Big-box stores could help slash emissions and save millions by putting solar panels on roofs. Why aren't more of them doing it? Climate change-fueled wildfires played a significant role in reducing air quality in the US in 2021. The authors pointed to a number of fires that led to hazardous air pollution — including the Caldor and Dixie fires in California, as well as the Bootleg Fire in Oregon, which wafted smoke all the way to the East Coast in July. China — which is among the countries with the worst air pollution — showed improved air quality in 2021. More than half of the Chinese cities analyzed in the report saw lower levels of air pollution compared to the previous year. The capital city of Beijing continued a five-year trend of improved air quality, according to the report, due to a policy-driven drawdown of polluting industries in the city. The report also found that the Amazon Rainforest, which had acted as the world’s major defender against the climate crisis, emitted more carbon dioxide than it absorbed last year. Deforestation and wildfires have threatened the critical ecosystem, polluted the air and contributed to climate change. “This is all a part of the formula that will lead to or is leading to global warming.” Hammes said. The report also unveiled some inequalities: Monitoring stations remain scant in some developing countries in Africa, South America and the Middle East, resulting in a dearth of air quality data in those regions. “When you don’t have that data, you’re really in the dark,” Hammes said. Related article Could Russia's war kick-start a renewable-energy revolution? It depends where in the world you look Hammes noted the African country of Chad was included in the report for the first time, due to an improvement in its monitoring network. IQAir found the country’s air pollution was the second-highest in the world last year, behind Bangladesh. Tarik Benmarhnia, a climate change epidemiologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography who has studied the health impact of wildfire smoke, also noted that relying only on monitoring stations can lead to blind spots in these reports. “I think it is great that they relied on different networks and not only governmental sources,” Benmarhnia, who was not involved in this report, told CNN. “However, many regions do not have enough stations and alternative techniques exist.” The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded in its 2021 report that, in addition to slowing the speed of global warming, curbing the use of fossil fuels would have the added benefit of improving air quality and public health. Hammes said the IQAir report is even more reason for the world to wean off fossil fuel. “We’ve got the report, we can read it, we can internalize it and really devote ourselves to taking action,” she said. “There needs to be a major move towards renewable energy. We need to take drastic action in order to reverse the tide of global warming; otherwise, the impact and the train that we’re on (would be) irreversible.” © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

1,2024-08-01 15:13:49.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-01 13:06:38.000,Big-box stores could help slash emissions and save millions by putting solar panels on roofs. Why aren't more of them doing it?,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/20/us/solar-power-on-big-box-store-rooftops-climate/index.html,2022-03-20 07:01:50.000,"As the US attempts to wean itself off its heavy reliance on fossil fuels and shift to cleaner energy sources, many experts are eyeing a promising solution: your neighborhood big-box stores and shopping malls. The rooftops and parking lot space available at retail giants like Walmart, Target and Costco is massive. And these largely empty spaces are being touted as untapped potential for solar power that could help the US reduce its dependency on foreign energy, slash planet-warming emissions and save companies millions of dollars in the process. At the IKEA store in Baltimore, installing solar panels on the roof and over the store’s parking lot cut the amount of energy it needed to purchase by 84%, slashing its costs by 57% from September to December of 2020, according to the company. (The panels also provide some beneficial shade to keep customers’ cars cool on hot, sunny days.) Related article Could Russia's war kick-start a renewable-energy revolution? It depends where in the world you look As of February 2021, IKEA had 54 solar arrays installed across 90% of its US locations. Big-box stores and shopping centers have enough roof space to produce half of their annual electricity needs from solar, according to a report from nonprofit Environment America and research firm Frontier Group. Leveraging the full rooftop solar potential of these superstores would generate enough electricity to power nearly 8 million average homes, the report concluded, and would cut the same amount of planet-warming emissions as pulling 11.3 million gas-powered cars off the road. The average Walmart store, for example, has 180,000 square feet of rooftop, according to the report. That’s roughly the size of three football fields and enough space to support solar energy that could power the equivalent of 200 homes, the report said. “Every rooftop in America that isn’t producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them,” Johanna Neumann, senior director for Environment America’s campaign for 100% Renewable, told CNN. “Now is the time to lean into local renewable energy production, and there’s no better place than the roofs of America’s big-box superstores.” Advocates involved in clean energy worker-training programs tell CNN that a solar revolution in big-box retail would also be a significant windfall for local communities, spurring economic growth while tackling the climate crisis, which has inflicted disproportionate harm on marginalized communities. Yet only a fraction of big-box stores in the US have solar on their rooftops or solar canopies in parking lots, the report’s authors told CNN. Related article Why record-high gas prices won't be solved by drilling more oil in the US CNN reached out to five of the top US retailers — Walmart, Kroger, Home Depot, Costco and Target — to ask: Why not invest in more rooftop solar? Many renewable energy experts point to solar as a relatively simple solution to cut down on costs and help rein in fossil fuel emissions, but the companies point to several roadblocks — regulations, labor costs and structural integrity of the rooftops themselves — that are preventing more widespread adoption. The need for these kinds of clean energy initiatives is becoming “unquestionably urgent” as the climate crisis accelerates, said Edwin Cowen, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Cornell University. “We are behind the eight ball, to put it mildly,” Cowen told CNN. “I would have loved to see policy help incentivize rooftop solar 15 years ago instead of five years ago in the commercial space. There’s still a tremendous amount of work to do.” Neumann said Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, possesses by far the largest solar potential. Walmart has around 5,000 stores in the US and more than 783 million square feet of rooftop space — an area larger than Manhattan — and more than 8,974 gigawatt hours of annual rooftop solar potential, according to the report. It’s enough electricity to power more than 842,000 homes, the report said. “Every rooftop in America that isn’t producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them.” Johanna Neumann, Environment America Walmart spokesperson Mariel Messier told CNN the company is involved in renewable energy projects around the world, but many of them are not rooftop solar installations. The company has reported having completed on- and off-site wind and solar projects or had others under development with a capacity to produce more than 2.3 gigawatts of renewable energy. Neumann said Environment America has met with Walmart a few times, urging the retailer to commit to installing solar panels on roofs and in parking lots. The company has said it’s aiming to source 100% of its energy through renewable projects by 2035. “Of all the retailers in America, Walmart stands to make the biggest impact if they put rooftop solar on all of their stores,” Neumann told CNN. “And for us, this report just underscores just how much of an impact they could make if they make that decision.” According to Environment America, Walmart had installed almost 194 megawatts of solar capacity on its US facilities as of the end of the 2021 fiscal year and additional capacity in off-site solar farms. The company’s installations in California were expected to provide between 20% to 30% of each location’s electricity needs. Target ranked No. 1 for on-site solar capacity in 2019, according to industry trade group Solar Energy Industries Association’s most recent report. It currently has 542 locations with rooftop solar — around a quarter of the company’s stores — a Target spokesperson told CNN. Rooftop solar generates enough energy to meet 15% to 40% of Target properties’ energy needs, the spokesperson said. Richard Galanti, the chief financial officer at Costco, said the company has 121 stores with rooftop solar around the world, 95 of which are in the US. Walmart, Target and Costco did not share with CNN what their biggest barriers are to adding rooftop or parking lot solar panels to more stores.  “My suspicion is that they want an even stronger business case for deviating from business-as-usual,” Neumann said. “Historically, all those roofs have done is cover their stores, and rethinking how [they] use their buildings and thinking of them as energy generators, not just protection from rain, requires a small change in their business model.” Home Depot, which has around 2,300 stores, currently has 75 completed rooftop solar projects, 12 in construction and more than 30 planned for future development, said Craig D’Arcy, the company’s director of energy management. Solar power generates around half of these stores’ energy needs on average, he said. Aging rooftops at stores are a “huge impediment” to solar installation, D’Arcy added. If a roof needs to be replaced in the next 15 to 20 years or sooner, it doesn’t make financial sense for Home Depot to add solar systems today, he said. “We have a goal of implementing solar rooftop where the economics are attractive,” D’Arcy told CNN. CNN also reached out to Kroger, which owns about 2,800 stores across the US. Kristal Howard, a Kroger spokesperson, said the company currently has 15 properties — stores, distribution centers and manufacturing plants — with solar installations. One of the “multiple factors affecting the viability of a solar installation” was the stores’ ability to support a solar installation on the roofs, Howard said. Cowen, the engineering professor at Cornell, said solar is already attractive, but that labor costs, incentives and the different layers of regulation likely pose some financial challenges in solar installations. “For them, this means usually hiring a local site firm that can do that installation that also knows local policy,” Cowen said. “It’s just another layer of complexity that I think is beginning to make sense because the costs have come down enough, but it needs kind of reopening that door of getting into an existing building.” Related article 'Delay means death': We're running out of ways to adapt to the climate crisis, new report shows. Here are the key takeaways Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois, who co-chairs the power sector task force in the House, said the US has “failed to provide the incentives to people who have the expertise to go in and build these things.” The reason both retail companies and the power sector have not made much progress on solar is because “our system is so disjointed” and has a complex regulation structure, Casten said. “Why aren’t we doing something that makes economic sense? The answer is this horribly disjointed federal policy where we massively subsidize fossil energy extraction, and we penalize clean energy production,” Casten told CNN. “For a long, long time, if you wanted to build a solar panel on the rooftop of Walmart, your biggest enemy was going to be your local utility because they didn’t want to lose the load. “We could have done this decades ago,” Casten added. “And had we done it, we would not be in this dire position with the climate, but we’d also have a lot more money in our pocket.” For Charles Callaway, director of organizing at the nonprofit group WE ACT for Environmental Justice, strengthening the rooftop solar capacity in big box retail stores is a no-brainer, especially if companies allow the local community to reap benefits either through installation jobs or sharing the electricity produced later. Either way, it would put a massive dent in curbing the climate crisis and help usher in an equitable transition away from fossil fuels — and it’s doable, Callaway told CNN. The New York City resident led a worker training program that helped train more than 100 local community members, mostly people of color, to become solar installers. He also formed a solar workers cooperative to ensure many of the participants of the training program get jobs in a tough market. In the last two years, Callaway said his group has not only installed solar panels on roofs of affordable housing units, but also equipment capable of producing 2 megawatts of solar energy on shopping malls up in upstate New York. He emphasized that hiring locally would be most beneficial since local installers know the community and local regulations best. Related article Allergy season will start much earlier than normal and be far more intense because of climate crisis, study suggests “One of my huge concerns is social equity,” Cowen said. “Access to renewable energy is a fairly privileged position these days, and we’ve got to figure out ways to make that not true.” Jasmine Graham, WE ACT’s energy justice policy manager, said the potential of building rooftop solar on big box superstores is encouraging, only “if these projects use local labor, if they are paying prevailing wages, and if this solar is being used in a manner such as community solar, which would allow [utility] bill discounts for folks that live in the same utility zone.” Pressure is mounting for global leaders to act urgently on the climate crisis after a UN report in late February warned the window for action is rapidly closing. Neumann believes the US can meet its energy demand with renewables. All it takes, she said, is the political will to make that switch, and the inclusion of the local community so no one gets left behind in the transition. “The sooner we make that transition, the sooner we’ll have cleaner air, the sooner we’ll have a more protected environment and better health and the sooner we’ll have a more livable future for our kids,” Neumann said. “And even if that requires investment, it is an investment worth making.” CNN’s Judson Jones contributed to this report. © 2024 Cable News Network.

Bringing the second day of this year’s Coachella to a close, K-Pop girl group Blackpink made history Saturday night when they became the first Asian act to ever headline the festival. To a crowd of, reportedly, over 125,000 people, Jennie, Jisoo, Lisa and Rosé used the ground-breaking moment to pay homage to Korean heritage by arriving onstage in hanboks: a traditional type of dress. While the garments were shrugged off a few seconds into their opening track, “Pink Venom,” revealing each member’s custom black and pink Dolce and Gabbana outfit, fans across the world had already received the message. Screenshots of the moment quickly spread among Blackpink superfans, otherwise known as Blinks. “The way they stepped onto the biggest western stage in hanboks … literally proved their place at the top of the industry,” tweeted one Blink. “Blackpink really are in a league of their own.” Another called the group “Korea’s cultural delegation” on Instagram, in reference to not only the hanboks but other visual cues incorporated into their show, such as one of the stage backdrops featuring an angular tiled roof reminiscent of traditional Korean architecture. Look of the Week: Are we about to see more men in tights? In recent years, Blackpink have enjoyed a meteoric rise to global fame. According to Guinness World Records, they are currently the most streamed female group on Spotify, and have the most-viewed music YouTube channel. Last year, they were the first female K-Pop group to reach number 1 in the UK and US album charts, and in 2020 their track “How You Like That” became the most viewed video on YouTube in 24 hours. (The group also wore modernized hanboks, designed by Kim Danha, in one of the music video’s scenes.) Their landmark set over the weekend was in fact a follow-up to another milestone: In 2019, they became the first female K-Pop group to ever play at Coachella or any other US festival. From the iconic Jean Paul Gaultier cone bra worn by Madonna for her 1990 Blond Ambition tour to Geri “Ginger Spice” Halliwell’s Union Jack mini dress, the right stage costume can live on forever in public memory. Particularly when worn at a career-defining moment. During another watershed Coachella performance — Beyonce’s 2018 headline set — the singer’s custom Balmain collegiate-style yellow hoodie was a joyful nod to Black culture, specifically historically Black colleagues and universities. The group’s four black hanboks were custom created by South Korean pattern design brand OUWR and traditional Korean dressmakers Kumdanje. Inspired by the Cheol-lik silhouette, each garment was hand-embroidered with metallic traditional Korean motifs, including dan-cheong patterns and peonies (a symbol of royalty in Korea). “It was our pleasure and such an honor to be able to show the beautiful values of Korea and Hanbok together,” the designers wrote in a combined Instagram post. “Blackpink showed the beauty of Korea and dazzled the world.” In Korea, hanboks are still worn for special occasions and often seen on TV dramas. Many designers in the country have also created contemporary takes that are incorporated into everyday wear. At Seoul Fashion Week, JULYCOLUMN’s Fall-Winter 2023 collection drew on the hanbok’s voluminous silhouette to create shirts and structured jackets. Last September, Korean label BlueTamburin brought the garment to a Western audience by exclusively using traditional hanbok fabric to create its Spring-Summer 2023 collection at Milan Fashion Week. Look of the Week: 'Barbie' stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling hit the road in bubblegum pink Whether you’re a devoted Blink or not, the looks marked a moment of Asian visibility, recognition of traditional craftsmanship and a powerful example of feeling seen through fashion — representing Korean culture and symbolically embracing both its past and future. At the end of their performance, and having addressed the audience between numbers in English throughout their two-hour-long performance, Blackpink finished their set in Korean: “Until now, it has been Jennie, Jisoo, Lisa, and Rosé Blackpink. Thank you.” Top image: Blackpink performing at the first weekend of Coachella 2023, shortly after removing their hanboks. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. “Old Masters” such as Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli and Rembrandt may have used proteins, especially egg yolk, in their oil paintings, according to a new study. Trace quantities of protein residue have long been detected in classic oil paintings, though they were often ascribed to contamination. A new study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications found the inclusion was likely intentional — and sheds light on the technical knowledge of the Old Masters, the most skilled European painters of the 16th, 17th, or early 18th century, and the way they prepared their paints. Scientists confirm long held theory about what inspired Monet “There are very few written sources about this and no scientific work has been done before to investigate the subject in such depth,” said study author Ophélie Ranquet of the Institute of Mechanical Process Engineering and Mechanics at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany, in a phone interview. “Our results show that even with a very small amount of egg yolk, you can achieve an amazing change of properties in the oil paint, demonstrating how it might have been beneficial for the artists.” Simply adding some egg yolk to their works, it turns out, could have long-lasting effects that went beyond just aesthetics. Compared with the medium formulated by ancient Egyptians called tempera — which combines egg yolk with powdered pigments and water — oil paint creates more intense colors, allows for very smooth color transitions and dries far less quickly, so it can be used for several days after its preparation. However, oil paint, which uses linseed or safflower oil instead of water, also has drawbacks, including being more susceptible to color darkening and damage caused by exposure to light. Because making paint was an artisanal and experimental process, it is possible that the Old Masters might have added egg yolk, a familiar ingredient, to the newer type of paint, which first showed up in the seventh century in Central Asia before spreading to Northern Europe in the Middle Ages and Italy during the Renaissance. In the study, the researchers recreated the process of paint-making by using four ingredients — egg yolk, distilled water, linseed oil and pigment — to mix two historically popular and significant colors, lead white and ultramarine blue. “The addition of egg yolk is beneficial because it can tune the properties of these paints in a drastic way,” Ranquet said, “For example by showing aging differently: It takes a longer time for the paint to oxidize, because of the antioxidants contained in the yolk.” The chemical reactions between the oil, the pigment and the proteins in the yolk directly affect the paint’s behavior and viscosity. “For example, the lead white pigment is quite sensitive to humidity, but if you coat it with a protein layer, it makes it a lot more resistant to it, making the paint quite easy to apply,” Ranquet said. “On the other hand, if you wanted something stiffer without having to add a lot of pigment, with a bit of egg yolk you can create a high impasto paint,” she added, referring to a painting technique where the paint is laid out in a stroke thick enough that the brushstrokes are still visible. Using less pigment would have been desirable centuries ago, when certain pigments — such as lapis lazuli, which was used to make ultramarine blue — were more expensive than gold, according to Ranquet. A direct evidence of the effect of egg yolk in oil paint, or lack thereof, can be seen in Leonardo da Vinci’s “Madonna of the Carnation,” one of the paintings observed during the study. Currently on display at the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, Germany, the work shows evident wrinkling on the face of Mary and the child. “Oil paint starts to dry from the surface down, which is why it wrinkles,” Ranquet said. One reason for wrinkling may be an insufficient quantity of pigments in the paint, and the study has shown that this effect could be avoided with the addition of egg yolk: “That’s quite amazing because you have the same quantity of pigment in your paint, but the presence of the egg yolk changes everything.” Because wrinkling occurs within days, it’s likely that Leonardo and other Old Masters might have caught onto this particular effect, as well as additional beneficial properties of egg yolk in oil paint, including resistance to humidity. The “Madonna of Carnation” is one of Leonardo’s earliest paintings, created at a time when he might have been still trying to master the then newly popular medium of oil paint. Another painting observed during the study was “The Lamentation Over the Dead Christ,” by Botticelli, also on display at the Alte Pinakothek. The work is mostly made with tempera, but oil paint has been used for the background and some secondary elements. “We knew that some parts of the paintings show brushstrokes that are typical for what we call an oil painting, and yet we detected the presence of proteins,” Ranquet said. “Because it’s a very small quantity and they are difficult to detect, this might be dismissed as contamination: In workshops, artists used many different things, and maybe the eggs were just from the tempera.” However, because adding egg yolk had such desirable effects on oil paint, the presence of proteins in the work might be an indication of deliberate use instead, the study suggested. Ranquet hopes that these preliminary findings might attract more curiosity toward this understudied topic. DNA analysis of Beethoven's hair reveals health issues — and a family secret Maria Perla Colombini, a professor of analytical chemistry at the University of Pisa in Italy, who was not involved in the study, agreed. “This exciting paper provides a new scenario for the understanding of old painting techniques,” she said in an email. “The research group, reporting results from molecular level up to a macroscopic scale, contributes to a new knowledge in the use of egg yolk and oil binders. They are not more looking at simply identifying the materials used by Old Masters but explain how they could produce wonderful and glittering effects by employing and mixing the few available natural materials. They try to discover the secrets of old recipes of which little or nothing is written,” she added. “This new knowledge contributes not only to a better conservation and preservation of artworks but also to a better comprehension of art history.” Top image: The “Mona Lisa” by Leonardo Da Vinci © 2024 Cable News Network.

1,2024-08-01 15:13:49.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-01 13:06:38.000,How Playboy cut ties with Hugh Hefner to create a post-MeToo brand,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/playboy-the-conversation/index.html,2023-04-11 07:10:28.000,"Editor’s Note: The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation. Hugh Hefner launched Playboy Magazine 70 years ago this year. The first issue included a nude photograph of Marilyn Monroe, which he had purchased and published without her knowledge or consent. Hefner went on to build the Playboy brand off the backs of the countless women featured in its pages, whose beauty and performance of heightened feminine sexuality have entertained its readers for generations. Approaching its 70th anniversary in December, Playboy has radically shifted. With the magazine no longer in publication, the Playboy Mansion sold to a developer and London’s last remaining Playboy Club closing in 2021, what is the future for Playboy? The brand is changing to keep up with the post-#MeToo world. Hefner passed away one month before allegations against film producer Harvey Weinstein surfaced in 2017 giving momentum to the #MeToo movement (which saw survivors of sexual assault and harassment speak out against their abusers). READ MORE: Sex, love and companionship … with AI? Why human-machine relationships could go mainstream In recent years, many have re-evaluated Hefner’s legacy and relationships with women. The 2022 docuseries “The Secrets of Playboy” (which aired on Channel 4 in the UK) detailed sexual misconduct accusations against Hefner from several ex-girlfriends, including model Sondra Theodore and TV personality Holly Madison. Hefner and Playboy’s relationship with women has been complicated. Playboy was an early supporter of abortion rights, helped fund the first rape kit and was at times an early proponent of inclusivity (for example featuring transgender model, Caroline “Tula” Cossey, in its June 1981 issue). But most women featured in Playboy have fit within a narrow beauty standard — thin, white, able-bodied and blonde. Meanwhile Hefner’s personal relationship with his much younger girlfriends reportedly followed patterns of control and emotional abuse. Ex-girlfriend Holly Madison described Hefner as treating her “like a glorified pet” in her 2015 memoir, “Down the Rabbit Hole.” Hefner’s passing meant he evaded reckoning with the #MeToo movement. Playboy, however, responded, releasing a statement in which it affirmed support for the women featured in “The Secrets of Playboy” and called Hefner’s actions “abhorrent.” The statement declared that the brand was no longer affiliated with the Hefner family and would be focusing on aspects of the company’s legacy that align with values of sex positivity and free expression. READ MORE: The ‘milf’: a brief cultural history, from Mrs Robinson to Stifler’s mom Today, Playboy is a very different company from the one Hefner launched nearly 70 years ago. Roughly 80% of Playboy staff identify as women, according the company, and its motto has changed from “Entertainment for Men” to “Pleasure for All.” Shares in the company are publicly traded and 40% of its board and management are women. The company has also moved towards more creator-led content through its app, Playboy Centerfold. Similar to subscription content service OnlyFans, Playboy Centerfold allows subscribers to view content from and interact with its creators, which it call “bunnies.” On the app, creators — or bunnies — are able portray their own bodies however they wish, putting the power back in their hands. Perhaps Playboy’s future is no longer in serving the male gaze, but instead the very audience Hefner dismissed in his first letter from the editor: “If you’re a man between the ages of 18 and 80 Playboy is meant for you … If you’re somebody’s sister, wife or mother-in-law and picked us up by mistake, please pass us along to the man in your life and get back to your Ladies Home Companion.” The stars of Playboy’s mid-2000s reality series, Holly Madison and Bridget Marquardt, are also enjoying a resurgence among fans. “The Girls Next Door” launched in 2004. The show focused on the lives of Hefner’s three girlfriends, Madison, Marquardt and Kendra Wilkinson. It became E’s best performing show and cultivated a new female audience for Playboy. “The Girls Next Door” was a story of complicated empowerment despite patriarchal interference. Its three female protagonists went from being known solely as some of Hefner’s many blonde girlfriends, to celebrities in their own right. They each ultimately broke up with Hefner, leaving the Mansion and going on to lead successful careers. The show’s depiction of Madison, Marquardt and Wilkinson as empowered, fun-loving and complex individuals, who found joy and agency through expressing their sexuality was perhaps what drew so many female fans to the show. However, amid the girls’ fight for agency, Hefner retaliated. The series shows that he maintained final say in every Playboy photograph of the girls, as well as imposing strict curfews and spending allowances. In Madison and Wilkinson’s memoirs, “Down the Rabbit Hole,” and “Sliding into Home,” they claim that production consistently undermined them. They refused to pay them for the first season, didn’t credit them until season four and aired their uncensored nude bodies in foreign broadcasts and DVD releases without consent. READ MORE: #MeToo in space: We must address the potential for sexual harassment and assault away from Earth Fan interest in “The Girls Next Door” remains strong. In August 2022 Madison and Marquardt launched their podcast “Girls Next Level,” where they interview previous playmates and interact with fans. They also recap episodes from their own points of view, unpacking their experiences of working on the show. Having reached 10 million downloads as of February 2023, the success of the podcast — 14 years after the last episode of “The Girls Next Door” — speaks to the cultural legacy of the Playboy brand. It also shows that despite Hefner’s original editor’s note, Playboy resonates with some women. Playboy is now in a post-Hefner era, where the imagery of women found within old issues of Playboy can serve as inspiration for others to enjoy their own sexuality. Whatever the future has for the company, the concept of Playboy has become public property — be that in the appearance of Playboy bunny costumes each Halloween, the popularity of cheeky Playboy logo tattoos or branded lingerie and clothing. In a post-#MeToo era, the women of Playboy are speaking up and taking over. With the mansion gates closed, the bunnies are finally reclaiming the brand as their own.

1,2024-08-01 15:13:49.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-01 13:06:38.000,'A definitive backslide.' Inside fashion's worrying runway trend,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/fashion-week-fall-winter-2023-size-diversity-skinny-wegovy/index.html,2023-04-06 20:53:38.000,"Now that the Fall-Winter 2023 catwalks have been disassembled, it’s clear one trend was more pervasive than any collective penchant for ruffles, pleated skirts or tailored coats. Across runways in New York, London, Milan and Paris, there was a notable scarcity of plus-size models. This comes at a time when there are five injectable medications which can be used as appetite suppressants currently available by prescription in the US, stirring much conversation; a sixth medication, Rybelsus, is taken as an oral pill. Two are officially approved in the UK — the largest influx of weight loss medication seen in the country in almost a decade. Dior's landmark Mumbai show signals India's growing luxury status In recent months, injectables such as Wegovy and Ozempic — which share the same active ingredient, semaglutide — have been widely reported as Hollywood’s worst-kept weight loss secret. (Ozempic is intended for use primarily to treat Type 2 diabetes.) Comedian Chelsea Handler claimed her “anti-aging doctor just hands (Ozempic) out to anybody” while appearing on a podcast in January. Even Elon Musk tweeted last year about being on Wegovy. For many fashion commentators and diversity advocates, the Fall-Winter 2023 runways were in sharp contrast to the (albeit limited) progress and heady promise of recent seasons. This rollback has been widely criticized in the style media as such. And its potential impact is being assessed more broadly: With the rise of these weight loss panaceas, the pursuit of size zero is now just a prescription away. In 2020, Jill Kortleve and Paloma Elsesser became the first models outside of a sample size to walk for the Italian fashion house Fendi. (Traditionally, a sample size falls between a US 0-4.) British label Erdem entered the plus-size market in 2021, extending its offering to a UK size 22 (or US size 18). And in January 2022, Valentino made headlines after its haute couture show featured a broad spectrum of body types. But this season, there was a visible lack of curve bodies on their runways — or many others. Fendi and Valentino did not respond when contacted by CNN, while Erdem declined to comment. According to fashion search engine Tagwalk, the number of mid and plus-size models dropped by 24% in comparison to Spring-Summer 2023. Similarly, a size inclusivity report conducted by Vogue Business found that 95.6% of all looks presented for Fall-Winter 2023 were in a size US 0-4. For context, industry market firm Plunkett Research estimated in 2015 that 68% of American women wear a size US 14 or above. “It was a definitive backslide,” said IMG model agent Mina White, who represents plus-size and curve supermodels including Elsesser and Ashley Graham. “It was frustrating to see some of these designers not using curved bodies where they had in the past.” Fendi and Valentino did not respond when contacted by CNN, while Erdem declined to comment. “Watching somebody like Ashley Graham attend the front row for so many of these major houses in full looks (provided by the designer), it was frustrating,” White continued. “They wanted to utilize her image and her social following to command a certain space in the market, but they didn’t want to be reflective on their runways.” For others, even the term “backslide” was too generous. “Slipping back from… what? A glorious time when the average American woman (size 16) was as present on the runways as she is in everyday life? A time when fashion ads cast as many ‘plus-size’ and ‘mid-size’ women as ‘straight-size’ women?” fashion journalist Amy Odell wrote in her Substack newsletter of this past season’s runways. “No one needed any data to understand that representing a wide array of body shapes and sizes in runway shows or in fashion imagery is not a priority for the industry.” That said, a handful of — mostly smaller — brands pushed ahead this season. In London, emerging labels Di Petsa, Karoline Vitto and Sinead O’Dwyer showcased lineups of size-diverse models. Inclusivity at Christian Siriano, Coach, Kim Shui, Collina Strada and Bach Mai stood out in New York; while in Paris, Belgian brand Esther Manas — a consistent flag-bearer for size diversity — staged one of the city’s most refreshing runways with an assortment of fun, sensual, feminine looks that complimented a range of bodies. There was also a smattering of mid- and plus-size castings to be seen elsewhere: Off-White and Michael Kors, for example, featured a few such models. At Harris Reed’s debut for Nina Ricci, Precious Lee opened the show — which also featured three more plus- and mid-size models. Fashion samples and sample size pieces are one-off garments made before an item is mass-produced, typically to be worn during runway shows. Prioritizing the same body type in sample sizes means runway models are more easily interchangeable, saving fashion houses time and money if someone were to drop out or get sick during or after the casting process for a show. It’s also partly why, according to White, casting curve models is still an uphill battle. She says she introduces brands to new faces months in advance of runway season, with their specific measurements up-top and easy to read in all correspondence. “I want to be ahead of that,” White said. “So I’m never told ‘Oh, we wanted to make it work, but we didn’t have her size’ or whatever that conversation might look like.” Look of the Week: What Pope Francis' AI puffer coat says about the future of fashion But despite her efforts, she says she’s frequently told it’s too much of a “financial lift” to make larger samples — even by legacy brands. “I get very upset when brands say that,” White said. “I don’t believe that it is, I believe that it’s people not being properly educated on how to do this right.” Beyond the lack of representation, White notes it’s painful for plus-size consumers to watch brands leverage resources to create custom, made-to-fit pieces for celebrities — all the while claiming the pot is empty for more inclusive runway samples. London-based stylist and editor Francesca Burns agrees sample sizes are part of the problem. In 2020, Burns went viral after she posted on Instagram about a fashion job gone wrong. She says she was sent five looks to style from Celine, none of which fit the size UK 8 (US 4) model booked for the shoot— an 18-year-old on her first job in the business. The experience left her “horrified,” Burns told CNN, recalling what she saw as the model’s shame and embarrassment. “Looking into this girl’s eyes,” Burns said, “she shouldn’t have felt like that.” Burns’ post, which called the current system “unacceptable,” was picked up widely in the fashion media. (When reached by CNN, Celine declined to comment on the incident.) “Ultimately, the desire to see change has to be there,” Burns said. “And I wonder whether luxury has that desire?” Progress has been slow, but not entirely inexistent. Across fashion campaigns, magazine covers and editorial shoots, there is a growing enthusiasm for inclusivity. “I see the options rolling in for the plus-sized talent, and they’re great offerings,” said White. “Great, strong editorials and covers and campaigns. But I do feel like without the clothes, we are going to go back to see more naked curve stories, or lingerie curve stories or a curve girl in a trench coat. That’s what I don’t want.” For British Vogue’s April issue, unveiled March 16, Elsesser, Lee and Jill Kortleve were dubbed “The New Supers.” Preceding the cover story is a letter written by editor-in-chief, Edward Enninful commending the models for “leading the way” and holding “powerful space” in the industry. “Catwalks are once again under scrutiny for a stark lack of body diversity,” read the magazine’s Instagram caption, unveiling the cover. “But this cover was not conceived as a statement. It is a crowning of an all-powerful trio, the supermodels for a new generation.” But many online were quick to point out the disconnect: Two of the Saint Laurent Spring-Summer 2023 dresses were modeled by plus-size women, though they are not available to buy in most plus sizes. In his own social media post, Enninful wrote about his disappointment at the Fall-Winter 2023 runways. “I thought I had gotten into a time machine. Show after show dominated by one body type, so many limited visions of womanhood… one prescribed notion of beauty prevailed again, and it felt like the reality of so many women around the world were being ignored.” But for White, the power rests within the entire industry — not just at the feet of brands. “I really do believe there should be an industry standard between the (Council of Fashion Designers of America), the British Fashion Council and key editors at some of these major mass market magazines,” she continued. “If there was a call-to-action from these figureheads saying, moving forward samples need to be readily available for a few different body types, we would see significant and impactful change.” Burns agrees there must be a trickle-down effect. “I think a lot of responsibility is put on young designers to solve all these issues around sustainability or issues around body inclusivity,” she said. “It’s important that the big powerhouses, which have the capacity to action change, really take some responsibility.” On March 8, Wegovy — developed primarily as a treatment for those living with obesity and weight-related conditions — was approved in the UK. It’s the second injectable weight management medication to be made available with a prescription via the country’s National Health Service (NHS) in about 3 years, after almost a decade of quiet. Before 2020, the last weight loss medication was approved in the UK was in 2010. Similarly, the US has now approved three weight management injections: Wegovy, Saxenda and IMCIVREE. Medications for type-2 diabetes like Mounjaro and Ozempic are not FDA-approved for weight loss, though some doctors are issuing them at their own discretion. While these medicines are a revolutionary tool for those who struggle to lose weight for genetic or medical reasons, they are at risk of being abused. Semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic, was originally developed for treating type-2 diabetes. It quells hunger signals to the brain by mimicking the hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). “It can slow how quickly your stomach empties out and may give you a little more feeling of feeling full,” said Dr. Robert Lash, an endocrinologist and Chief Medical Officer of the Endocrine Society in Washington, D.C. In clinical trials, over a period of 68 weeks, participants who used the medication in conjunction with eating fewer calories and increasing their physical activity on average lost around 15% of their body weight compared to 2.4% of those using a placebo, according to the manufacturer Novo Nordisk. On March 13, the European Medicines Agency issued a statement warning of an Ozempic shortage that could continue through the year, urging doctors to prioritize prescriptions to diabetics. “Any other use, including for weight management, represents off-label use and currently places the availability of Ozempic for the indicated population at risk,” read the release. Patients typically need a BMI of 27 or higher (along with another weight-related condition like high blood pressure or diabetes) or have a genetic predisposition towards obesity to be prescribed such appetite suppressant medication by their doctor. But talk of these injectables has been sweeping the West. In January, the New York Times reported on the term “Ozempic Face,” coined by a New York-based dermatologist who reported treating several patients with a hollowed-out appearance that can come with rapid weight loss. By the end of February, the medication had made it to the cover of New York Magazine in a feature titled “Life After Food?” Adverts for GLP-1 injections are even blanketing New York City subway stations. And across social media, online forums and private group chats, some people looking to lose weight for primarily aesthetic purposes are searching for a way to skirt the requirements. “I was just looking for a way to lose a few pounds, like 10 to 15 at most,” said one 30-year-old American woman, who wished to remain anonymous, in a phone interview. She scoured social media and forums for guidance on securing a weight loss drug. “I’m certainly a normal BMI, I just have a trip to Mexico coming up and I want to look really good,” she said. Although she says she found a way to access Wegovy, she decided against the medication after considering the cost (which can reach more than $1,000 a month without insurance). “I’ve always very much fit the societal standard but lately I was just like f*ck it, I want to be skinny,” she told CNN. Dr. Lash emphasized the importance of taking weight loss drugs only with medical supervision and a valid prescription. “If somebody was a normal weight and they took this drug because they thought they could be even thinner than they are now, that could lead to complications,” he told CNN, warning of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and even gallbladder problems. “These drugs are not benign, they do have side effects involving the GI tract. There’s no such thing as a free lunch.” Fashion has long promoted size 0 as the ultimate virtue — regardless of its viability for many people, or any health risks. And now with the accessibility of accelerated weight loss medication, the stakes are even higher. For Burns and White, the industry is responsible for amplifying a new, more inclusive vision of beauty. “There’s a very archaic way of looking at women over a size 16 and just assuming that they’re unhealthy or uneducated or unstylish. Or don’t have the resources to buy into luxury,” said White. “The reality is the same women these brands are alienating in their fashion space are the same women running out to buy their handbags, shoes, perfumes, cosmetics and skincare.” Not only do designers need to create clothes with this consumer in mind, according to White, but they need to be seen on the runway, too. “It shouldn’t be a conversation. It should just be normalized that we’re not just looking at a single view of beauty,” echoed Burns. Ester Manas and Balthazar Delepierre, whose bridal-inspired Fall-Winter 2023 collection was one of this season’s most size-diverse runways, summarized it best in their accompanying show notes: “The body is not the subject. Because, obviously, at a wedding, everybody is invited. And all to the party. That is where the designer duo Ester and Balthazar take their stand.” © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

1,2024-08-01 15:13:49.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-01 13:06:38.000,Michael Jordan's 1998 NBA Finals sneakers sell for a record $2.2 million,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/michael-jordan-sneakers-1998-finals-sothebys-auction-record/index.html,2023-04-12 03:17:57.000,"Editor’s Note: This story was updated with the final sale price and other details following the auction. In 1998, Michael Jordan laced up a pair of his iconic black and red Air Jordan 13s to bring home a Bulls victory during Game 2 of his final NBA championship — and now they are the most expensive sneakers ever to sell at auction.The game-winning sneakers sold for $2.2 million at Sotheby’s in New York on Tuesday, smashing the sneaker auction record of $1.47 million, set in 2021 by a pair of Nike Air Ships that Jordan wore earlier in his career. Remember when Dennis Rodman put on a wedding dress and claimed to marry himself? The sale arrives during “Jordan Year” — a reference to the NBA star player’s iconic jersey number 23. In January, Air Jordan partnered with Sotheby’s to auction off 13 pairs of retro sneakers that were designed in memory of The Notorious B.I.G. All lots outsold their high estimates of $5,000 by multiples, with the highest selling for more than $32,000. Last year, Jordan’s Game 1 jersey, also from the 1998 finals, became the most expensive item of worn sports memorabilia to sell at auction when it fetched $10.1 million at a Sotheby’s sale. Jordan’s farewell run with the Chicago Bulls is often referred to as “The Last Dance,” after the title of an ESPN and Netflix documentary that chronicled the season. Jordan announced his (second) retirement weeks before the finals, leading to the six-game series against the Utah Jazz becoming the most-watched in NBA history, based on Nielsen TV ratings. (Jordan would later return from 2001 to 2003 to play with the Washington Wizards, but did not win another championship). “Michael Jordan game-worn sports memorabilia has proven time and time again to be the most elite and coveted items on the market,” said Brahm Wachter, Sotheby’s head of streetwear and modern collectables, in a press release prior to the sale. “However, items from his ‘Last Dance’ season are of a greater scale and magnitude as seen with our record-breaking sale of his Game 1 jersey in 2022.” The pair of sneakers sold Tuesday were worn during Game 2, in Salt Lake City, which the Bulls won 93-88 after losing Game 1, with Jordan scoring 37 points. They are the last pair of black and red Air Jordan 13s that Jordan ever wore on the court for an NBA game, a press release from Sotheby’s noted. 13 of the best menswear looks from Oscars history Following Game 2, Jordan signed and gifted the set of worn shoes to the ball boy in the visitor’s locker room, as he was known to do, according to Sotheby’s. The Air Jordan 13 sneakers starred in a sports memorabilia sale called “Victoriam,” which featured items worn by athletes including Tom Brady, Kobe Bryant and Roger Federer. Several other Jordan items were included in the two-part auction, with a game-worn 1998 Bulls jersey and a pair of 1985 Air Jordan 1s fetching $508,000 and $127,000 respectively. Other top lots included one of Kobe Bryant’s LA Lakers shooting shirts, which sold for over $406,000, and a soccer jersey, worn by the late Pelé on his debut for the New York Cosmos in 1975, that sold fetched over $177,000.

But French photographer François Prost was looking for something altogether different during his recent road trip across America: strip clubs. From Miami to Los Angeles, Prost’s latest book “Gentlemen’s Club” charts his route across the US via nearly 150 strip clubs with names like Pleasures, Temptations and Cookies N’ Cream. There isn’t a single nude woman to be seen, however, as Prost’s camera was exclusively trained on the buildings themselves — and specifically their often-colorful facades. Over the course of five weeks in 2019 he traversed over 6,000 miles, with the resulting photos capturing everything from the pastel hues of Florida’s Club Pink Pussycat to venues hiding in plain sight in the country’s more religious states. “I’d divide these venues into two types: One is very integrated into the public landscape, and one is a bit more hidden and dodgy,” Prost said, speaking to CNN on a video call and email. The first type, he added, could be found in “very American” settings, such as “around amusement parks and fast food and malls.” The latter venues, however, would sometimes look indistinguishable from any store in a strip mall. Prost said he found many such establishments along the Bible Belt, a socially conservative region in the country’s south. He was especially keen to explore the area due to the apparent contrast between the prevalence of strip clubs and what he describes in his book as “conservatism and extreme puritanism.” Prost insisted that he had little interest in the interiors or services of the strip clubs, which he always visited during the day. Instead, he hoped to learn more about American culture by creating objective, documentary-style photographs of establishments sitting at the intersection of sex, gender and commerce. Documenting changing attitudes toward sex through the lens of architecture, he added that the series was primarily of a landscape photography project. Artful photos inside Houston's ONYX strip club tell a story of beauty and confidence “The prism of this theme of strip club facades became a way of studying and trying to understand the country,” he wrote in “Gentlemen’s Club,” photographs from which will feature in an exhibition in Tokyo in March. ”(‘Gentlemen’s Club’ is) an objective panorama of dominant opinions and gender and the sexualization of the feminine image.” The genesis of Prost’s project dates back to his 2018 series, “After Party,” which focused on the flamboyant facades of French nightclubs. He said that people frequently commented that the buildings’ exteriors looked as though they had been ripped straight out of American cities, sparking the idea that he should visit the US and extend the project. As he meticulously planned his trip, he was struck not only by the sheer volume of strip clubs in America but that — unlike In Europe — they often demanded to be seen. Hot pink walls, gigantic nude silhouettes and even candy-cane-striped storefronts made no secret of the kind of entertainment provided inside. From Brutalist Boston to Modernist Palm Springs, America's most eye-catching city halls “A good example would be Las Vegas, where strip clubs are everywhere and their signs blink as much as a fast food (restaurant) or casino sign,” Prost said. Miami’s clubs were often painted in vivid, Wes Anderson-esque hues. Other photos show brightly covered venues contrasting with their sparse desert surroundings. If the establishments were open during the day, Prost would enter and ask for permission to take photos in order “to not look suspicious… and explain what my intentions were,” he said. The interiors rarely lived up to the tantalizing promises plastered across the signs outside, but the photographer met a host of characters during his five-week trip, from indifferent bouncers to managers who were thrilled about the project. “Most of the time, people were OK — 99% of them would say yes to a facade picture,” he said, adding they typically wouldn’t mind his presence, as long as he didn’t take photos of patrons or dancers. “Some would think that it was a bit strange, some would be really excited about it and give me their business card to send me the picture when it was done,” he said. Prost said his biggest surprise, however, was how “normalized” strip clubs appeared to be in everyday life. As he reflects in his book, “The relationship that Americans seem to have with strip clubs is quite different to what you see in Europe. Going to a strip club seems to be a lot more normalized … You go as a couple, or amongst friends at night to have fun.” Giant doughnuts and a shoe you can walk into: California's strangest buildings He was struck, for instance, by the fact that so many Las Vegas strip clubs doubled as restaurants — with many boasting happy hour deals, buffets and special discounts for truck drivers or construction workers. “I noticed a few strip clubs that would advertise being a strip club and steakhouse, so you could eat a big piece of meat (while) watching strippers. That is also something that seems very American to me,” he said, adding: “I heard from some people I met in Portland there are even strip clubs (that offer) vegan food.” The facades are littered with jokes like “My sex life is like the Sahara, 2 palms, no dates” and pun-based names like Booby Trap and Bottoms Up. Prost’s documentarian approach heightens the signs’ surreal comedy. But it also doubles as a neutral lens through which viewers can make up their own minds about the objectification of women. By honing in on the faceless dancing bodies of female silhouettes and the quintessential “girls girls girls” signs, “Gentleman’s Club” explores the commodification of women who are, in reality, completely absent in Prost’s works (an observation reflected in the book’s title, which is a phrase that crops up numerous times on signs throughout his photographs). The strip clubs he visited market women as things to be consumed, from the many food-themed names to an advertisement reading, “1,000’s of beautiful girls & three ugly ones.” For his next project, Prost plans to visit Japan to document the nation’s love hotels, which occupy a similar role as strip clubs in some parts of the US: open secrets in a conservative society. But the photographer believes the American establishments he visited say something unique about the country — something that is less about sexuality and more about the American dream. Museum of Sex to open new outpost in Miami What his project has shown him is, he said, this: “As long as you’re successful in terms of business, (it doesn’t matter) if your activity deals with sex.” “Gentlemen’s Club” will be exhibited at Agnes b. Galerie Boutique in Tokyo, Japan, between March 17 and April 15, 2023. The book, published by Fisheye Editions, is available now. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

1,2024-08-01 15:13:49.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-01 13:06:38.000,Here's the real reason to turn on airplane mode when you fly,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/airplane-mode-reasons-why/index.html,2023-04-07 12:52:23.000,"Editor’s Note: The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation. We all know the routine by heart: “Please ensure your seats are in the upright position, tray tables stowed, window shades are up, laptops are stored in the overhead bins and electronic devices are set to flight mode.” Now, the first four are reasonable, right? Window shades need to be up so we can see if there’s an emergency, such as fire. Tray tables need to be stowed and seats upright so we can get out of the row quickly. Laptops can become projectiles in an emergency, as the seat back pockets are not strong enough to contain them. And mobile phones need to be set to flight mode so they can’t cause an emergency for the airplane, right? Well, it depends whom you ask. Aviation navigation and communication relies on radio services, which has been coordinated to minimize interference since the 1920s. The digital technology currently in use is much more advanced than some of the older analog technologies we used even 60 years ago. Research has shown personal electronic devices can emit a signal within the same frequency band as the aircraft’s communications and navigation systems, creating what is known as electromagnetic interference. Half of the world's 10 busiest airports for 2022 are in one country But in 1992, the US Federal Aviation Authority and Boeing, in an independent study, investigated the use of electronic devices on aircraft interference and found no issues with computers or other personal electronic devices during non-critical phases of flight. (Takeoffs and landings are considered the critical phases.) The US Federal Communications Commission also began to create reserved frequency bandwidths for different uses – such as mobile phones and aircraft navigation and communications – so they do not interfere with one another. Governments around the globe developed the same strategies and policies to prevent interference problems with aviation. In the EU, electronic devices have been allowed to stay on since 2014. What's the safest seat on a plane? We asked an aviation expert Why then, with these global standards in place, has the aviation industry continued to ban the use of mobile phones? One of the problems lies with something you may not expect – ground interference. Wireless networks are connected by a series of towers; the networks could become overloaded if passengers flying over these ground networks are all using their phones. The number of passengers that flew in 2021 was over 2.2 billion, and that’s half of what the 2019 passenger numbers were. The wireless companies might have a point here. Of course, when it comes to mobile networks, the biggest change in recent years is the move to a new standard. Current 5G wireless networks – desirable for their higher speed data transfer – have caused concern for many within the aviation industry. Radio frequency bandwidth is limited, yet we are still trying to add more new devices to it. The aviation industry points out that the 5G wireless network bandwidth spectrum is remarkably close to the reserved aviation bandwidth spectrum, which may cause interference with navigation systems near airports that assist with landing the aircraft. Airport operators in Australia and the US have voiced aviation safety concerns linked to 5G rollout, however it appears to have rolled out without such problems in the European Union. Either way, it is prudent to limit mobile phone use on planes while issues around 5G are sorted out. Most airlines now provide customers with Wi-Fi services that are either pay-as-you-go or free. With new Wi-Fi technologies, passengers could theoretically use their mobile phones to make video calls with friends or clients in-flight. On a recent flight, I spoke with a cabin attendant and asked her opinion on phone use during flights. It would be an inconvenience for cabin crew to wait for passengers to finish their call to ask them if they would like any drinks or something to eat, she stated. On an airliner with 200+ passengers, in-flight service would take longer to complete if everyone was making phone calls. For me, the problem with in-flight use of phones is more about the social experience of having 200+ people on a plane, and all potentially talking at once. In a time when disruptive passenger behaviour, including “air rage”, is increasingly frequent, phone use in flight might be another trigger that changes the whole flight experience. Disruptive behaviours take on various forms, from noncompliance to safety requirements such as not wearing seat belts, verbal altercations with fellow passengers and cabin crew, to physical altercations with passengers and cabin crews – typically identified as air rage. In conclusion – in-flight use of phones does not currently impair the aircraft’s ability to operate. But cabin crews may prefer not to be delayed in providing in-flight service to all of the passengers – it’s a lot of people to serve. However, 5G technology is encroaching on the radio bandwidth of aircraft navigation systems; we’ll need more research to answer the 5G question regarding interference with aircraft navigation during landings. Remember that when we are discussing the two most critical phases of flight, takeoffs are optional – but landings are mandatory.

1,2024-08-01 15:13:49.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-01 13:06:38.000,"'I was up to my waist down a hippo's throat.' He survived, and here's his advice",https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/hippo-attack-avoid-survive-paul-templer/index.html,2023-04-12 12:44:43.000,"Paul Templer was living his best life. He was 28 and conducting tours in his native Zimbabwe, with a focus on photographic safaris. He had been away for a few years, including a stint in the British army. But he had returned to Africa’s bush country “and fell back in love with it. The wildlife, the flora, the fauna, the great outdoors, the space – just everything about it. I was at home.” Templer said Zimbabwe’s guide certification program was rigorous, and there was a lot of pride among the guides who passed. He reveled in showing tourists the area’s majestic wildlife – including the water-loving, very territorial hippos. “It was idyllic,” he told CNN Travel. “Life was really, really good – until one day I had a really bad day at the office.” March 9, 1996. A Saturday. Templer learned a good friend who was to lead a canoe safari down the Zambezi River had malaria. He agreed to take his pal’s place. “I loved that stretch of the river. It was an area I know like the back of my hand.” The expedition consisted of six safari clients (four Air France crewmembers and a couple from Germany), three apprentice guides plus Templer. They had three canoes – clients in the first two seats and a guide in the back. Then one apprentice guide was in a one-person safety kayak. And down the famed Zambezi they went. “Things were going the way they were supposed to go. Everyone was having a pretty good time.” Eventually, they came across a pod of about a dozen hippos. That’s not unexpected on the Zambezi, Africa’s fourth-longest river. They weren’t alarmed at first as they were at a safe distance. But “we were getting closer, and I was trying to take evasive action. … The idea was let’s just paddle safely around the hippos.” Templer’s canoe led the way, with the other two canoes and kayak to follow. He pulled into a little channel waiting on the others. But the third canoe had fallen back from the group and was off the planned course. Templer’s not sure how that happened. Suddenly, there’s this big thud. And I see the canoe, like the back of it, catapulted up into the air. Paul Templer “Suddenly, there’s this big thud. And I see the canoe, like the back of it, catapulted up into the air. And Evans, the guide in the back of the canoe, catapulted out of the canoe.” The clients managed to remain in the canoe somehow. “Evans is in the water, and the current is washing Evans toward a mama hippo and her calf 150 meters [490 feet] away. … So I know I’ve got to get him out quickly. I don’t have time to drop my clients off.” He yells to Ben, one of the other guides, to retrieve the clients who were in the canoe that had been attacked. Ben got the clients to safety on a rock in the middle of the river that hippos couldn’t climb. Meanwhile, Templer turned his canoe around to get Evans. The plan was to pull alongside of him and pull him into Templer’s canoe. “I was paddling towards him … getting closer, and I saw this bow wave coming towards me. If you’ve ever seen any of those old movies with a torpedo coming toward a ship, it was kind of like that. I knew it was either a hippo or a really large crocodile coming at me,” he said. “But I also knew that if I slapped the blade of my paddle on water … that’s really loud. And the percussion underwater seems to turn the animals away,” he said. “So I slapped the water, and as it was supposed to do, the torpedo wave stops.” He was getting closer to Evans, but they were also getting closer to the female and calf. “I’m leaning over – it’s kind of a made-for-Hollywood movie – Evans is reaching up. … Our fingers almost touched. And then the water between us just erupted. Happened so fast I didn’t see a thing.” What happened next was nightmarish and surreal. “My world went dark and strangely quiet.” Templer said it took a few seconds to figure out what was going on. “From the waist down, I could feel the water. I could feel I was wet in the river. From my waist up, it was different. I was warm, and it wasn’t wet like the river, but it wasn’t dry either. And it was just incredible pressure on my lower back. I tried to move around; I couldn’t. “I realized I was up to my waist down a hippo’s throat.” There’s a good reason a fully grown hippopotamus can fit a large portion of a fully grown adult in its mouth. Hippos can grow up to 16.5 feet long (5 meters), 5.2 feet tall (1.6 meters) and weigh up to 4.5 tons (4 metric tonnes), according to National Geographic. They sport enormous mouths and can open their strong jaws to 150 degrees. Their teeth might be the most frightening thing of all. Their molars are used for eating plants, but their sharp canines, which might reach 20 inches (51 centimeters), are for defense and fighting. Their bite is almost three times stronger than that of a lion. One bite from a hippo can possibly cut a human body in half. They’re found naturally in various parts sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in East and Southern Africa, living in or near rivers and other water sources. (And they are an invasive species in Colombia thanks to escapees from drug lord Pablo Escobar’s menagerie). Hippos are very territorial and might aggressively attack any animal encroaching on their territory, including hyenas, lions and crocodiles. They also kill people. That we know for sure. Many internet sources say around 500 a year, but an exact figure is still uncertain because some attacks and deaths come in very remote regions and don’t get reported. “The question I get asked the most when people find out I study hippos is: ‘Is it true hippos kill more people than any animal?’ Rebecca Lewison, conservation ecologist and associate professor at San Diego State University, told CNN Travel in an email interview. How to survive a cobra bite -- or better yet, avoid one entirely “I’m not entirely sure where that started but … there is no authority or reliable data. People are surprised that hippos kill people. They look slow, and they are mostly in water. There are some nonfatal interactions, but people (or hippos) tend to fare badly from interactions.” Dr. Philip Muruthi, chief scientist and vice president of species conservation and science of the African Wildlife Foundation, said the AWF doesn’t have a credible source on the number of attacks or fatalities either. While more stats need to be collected, one study found that the probability of being killed by a hippopotamus attack is in the range of 29% to 87% – higher than that of a grizzly bear attack at 4.8%, shark attack at 22.7% and crocodile attack at 25%. Those were rather bad odds of survival working against Templer. “I’m guessing I was wedged so far down its throat it must have been uncomfortable because he spat me out. So I burst to the surface, sucked a lungful of fresh air and I came face to face with Evans, the guide who I was trying to rescue. And I said, ‘We got to get out of here!’ ” So once again, I’m up to my waist down the hippo’s throat. But this time, my legs are trapped but my hands are free. Paul Templer But Evans was in serious trouble. Templer started swimming back for him “and I was just moving in for your classic lifesaver’s hold when – WHAM! – I got hit from below. So once again, I’m up to my waist down the hippo’s throat. But this time my legs are trapped but my hands are free.” He tried to go for his gun, but he was being thrashed around so much he couldn’t grab it. The hippo – which turned out to be an older, aggressive male – spat Templer out a second time. “This time when I come to the surface I look around, there’s no sign of Evans.” Templer assumed Evans had been rescued, and he tried to escape himself. “I’m making pretty good progress and I’m swimming along there and I come up for the stroke and swimming freestyle and I look under my arm – and until my dying day I’ll remember this – there’s this hippo charging in towards me with his mouth wide open bearing in before he scores a direct hit.” This time, Templer was sideways in the hippo’s mouth, legs dangling out one side of the mouth, shoulders and head on the other side of its mouth. “And then he just goes berserk. … When hippos are fighting, the way they fight is they try to tear apart and just destroy whatever it is they’re attacking,” Templer said. “For me, fortunately everything was happening in slow motion. So when he’d go under water, I’d hold my breath. When we were on the surface, I would take a deep breath and I would try to hold onto tusks that were boring through me” to stop from being ripped apart. Templer said one of the clients watching the horror later described it like a “vicious dog trying to rip apart a rag doll.” He figures the whole attack took about three and a half minutes. Meanwhile, apprentice guide Mack in the safety kayak – “showing incredible bravery, risking his life to save mine – pulls his boat in inches from my face.” Templer managed to grab a handle on the kayak, and “Mack dragged me to the relative safety of this rock.” The expedition was still in one hell of a mess, though. People living near hippo territory are more likely victims of attacks than tourists, said Lewison. “Most of the attacks happen in the water, but because hippos raid crops on farms, there are also attacks on people trying to protect their crops. There are some tourists, but largely the attacks are happening to local residents,” Lewison said. Human encroachment from Africa’s booming population makes matters worse, increasing the chances of deadly interactions, she said. You encounter a bear in the wild. Do you know what to do next? Despite the encounters gone bad, sub-Saharan Africa depends on hippos. “Hippos are important ecosystem engineers of the ecology of freshwater areas they inhabit. This is through nutrient recycling from dung (they consume large amounts of vegetation),” Muruthi said. “Hippos attack not to eat people, but to get them the hell away from them,” Lewison said. “I don’t think hippos are particularly aggressive, but I think when under pressure, they attack.” Back on the rock in the Zambezi, Templer asked Mack where Evans was. Mack said, “He’s gone, man, he’s just gone.” Templer knew he needed to come up with a plan to get them off the rock and to the riverbank, but “first I needed to settle myself down.” He assessed the situation: One man missing. The first aid kit, radio and gun all gone. Six scared clients, two canoes and one paddle left. And his own body was shattered. “My left foot was especially bad; it looked as if someone had tried to beat a hole through it with a hammer.” He couldn’t move his arms. One arm from elbow down was “crushed to a pulp.” Blood was bubbling out of his mouth. They realized his lung was punctured. Mack rolled Templer over and could see a gaping hole in his back and plugged it with Saran Wrap from a plate of snacks. Templer made the call: No matter the risk, they had to get off that rock. He was loaded into a canoe. Ben paddled. The hippo kept bumping the canoe. He went from being terrified to calm on that ride back. He described “a profound spiritual experience in which I had this incredible sense of peace and realization this was my moment of choice. Like do I go, or do I stay? Do I close my eyes and drift off, or do I fight my way through this and stick around?” It was so intense I thought I was going to die, and when I didn’t, I kind of wished I would. Paul Templer on the pain after the attack “I chose to stick around, and as soon as I made that choice, it was more pain than I could ever imagine I could endure. It was so intense I thought I was going to die, and when I didn’t, I kind of wished I would.” Ben and Templer made it out of the river, but without finding Evans. His body was found three days later. They concluded he had drowned because he didn’t have any signs of animal attack on him. “Evans did nothing wrong. The fact that he died was purely a tragedy.” Meanwhile, some people on shore had realized something was wrong in the river. A well-trained Zimbabwe rescue team was able to safely ferry everyone else off the rock. “And that was my bad day at the office.” Templer was out of the river but not out of the woods. It took eight hours to drive him to the nearest hospital. In a month’s time, he had several major surgeries. He thought he would lose one leg and both arms. His surgeon didn’t think he’d live. But not only did the surgeon save Templer’s life, he saved his legs and one arm. The other arm, however, was beyond salvation. If you're attacked by an alligator, here's how to fight for your life He realized that in the ICU when he woke up and was feeling for his left hand. It was gone. “I just remember feeling devastated. I spent my whole life being active and it was almost more than I could bare.” But then he was flooded with relief to realize his right arm and legs had been saved. For the next month, he was “emotionally all over the map.” He got physical and occupational therapy in Zimbabwe and then more in the United Kingdom. He got a prosthesis “and then just started trying to get back to life.” Templer, Muruthi and Lewison all say safe outings start with education – and avoiding trouble in the first place. “Hippos have no interest in dealing with people. Stay away from them, and they will leave you alone. They are not hunting humans,” Lewison said. “Do not get close to them,” Muruthi said. “They don’t want any intrusion. … They’re not predators; it’s by accident if they’re injuring people.” Want close-up views and photos of the creatures? Instead of venturing too close, invest in good binoculars and telephoto camera lenses. Follow the rules. If you are a tourist, and it says ‘Stay in your vehicle,’ then stay in your vehicle. Philip Muruthi on avoiding hippo attacks Do not walk along well-worn hippo paths, stay close to your group and don’t approach them from behind, Muruthi said. “Follow the rules. If you are a tourist, and it says ‘Stay in your vehicle,’ then stay in your vehicle. And even when you’re in your vehicle, don’t drive it right to the animal.” Muruthi also advised that your party make some noise in areas known for hippos. “It’s good for them to know you’re around.” “Hippos usually come out of water late in the evening and at night to forage, so avoid trekking along the river at that time,” Muruthi said. Also stay on high alert during the dry season when food is scarce. Get to know the signs of disturbed hippos, Muruthi advised, in case you wander too closely. An agitated one will open its mouth wide and yawn as aggressive display. Also watch for a head thrown back, shaking of the head, grunting and snorting. “These are signs you should have left already!” Muruthi said. If you’ve attracted unwanted attention, Muruthi said to always remember you cannot outrun a hippo. They may look sluggish, but they can run 30 mph (almost 43 kph). Instead, you should try to climb a tree or find an obstacle to put between you and the hippo such as a rock or anthill. Muruthi, Lewison and Templer all said never stay between a hippo and the water. If it’s charging you, run parallel to the water source. As with so many other protective female animals, never get between a mama hippo and her young, Templer said. He was alone, deep in the moutains. And a rattlesnake just bit him. What if you’re in a small watercraft? “Typically, if a hippo is going to be attacking, you’ll see it coming way before. There will be that bow wave. … If you slap the water, the percussion 99.9 times out of 100 will turn the hippo,” Templer said. “If you’re in a canoe and a hippo knocks you in the water, get away from the canoe. The hippo is going for this big shape, getting it off its territory.” It’s also safer to view hippos on the water in a larger vessel, which the animal would have a harder time capsizing, Muruthi said. Unlike attacks by some other wild animals, humans are almost defenseless once an attack by a large hippo begins. “Once attacked, there is nothing you can do,” Muruthi said. “Fight for dear life and watch for any chance to escape.” He said you could try to poke at the eyes or any spot that might inflict unexpected pain. But given the size just of a hippo head, even that’s a tall order. Hippos typically hole punch you, so there isn’t much you can do if they get hold of you. Rebecca Lewison “Hippos typically hole punch you, so there isn’t much you can do if they get hold of you,” Lewison said. Based on his attack, Templer said try not to panic “when dragged underwater. Remember to suck in air if on the surface.” Another hippo attack survivor in this National Geographic video also was able to conserve her breath. She also grabbed the hippo’s snout, and one expert in the video theorizes that might have startled the hippo into letting her go. Two years after that attack, Templer said that he and a team made the longest recorded descent of the Zambezi River to date. It took three months and covered 1,600 miles (2,575 kilometers). How did Templer find the resilience to reclaim his life? After a particularly rough day trying to maneuver in a wheelchair, he said that his surgeon told him: “You’re the sum of your choices. You’re exactly who, what and where you choose to be in life.” Templer said he focused on what’s possible vs. what he’s lost. “If you look for what’s possible, it generally is.” Templer later moved to United States; got married to the sister of a journalist on the record-setting Zambezi trip; wrote the book “What’s Left of Me”; and is a speaker. Should people be afraid to even go on safari – especially in hippo areas – after learning of a harrowing story like Templer’s? Muruthi said go, but go smartly. Be sure to get advice from professional tour guides – and then follow their guidance, Muruthi said. “In Kenya, for example, contact the Kenya Professional Safari Guides Association,” he said. Templer said his attack was an “anomaly,” and he doesn’t want anyone to be dissuaded by what happened on his 1996 river run. “My biggest counsel would be: Absolutely go and do it.

Get the latest news in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments. He’d spent years backpacking around the world, and Japanese traveler Daisuke Kajiyama was finally ready to return home to pursue his long-held dream of opening up a guesthouse. In 2011, Kajiyama arrived back in Japan with his Israeli partner Hila, who he met in Nepal, and the pair set about finding the perfect location for their future venture. However, there were a couple of major stumbling blocks in their way. To start with, Kajiyama had very little money to speak of after years of globetrotting around destinations like Korea, Taiwan, India, Nepal, Guatemala, Cuba and Canada. He also happened to have his heart set on a traditional Japanese house, typically known as kominka, which are usually passed down over generations. “I wanted to have a traditional house in the countryside,” Kajiyama tells CNN Travel, explaining that he was determined to find two houses located next to each other, so that he and Hila could live in one, while the other would be a guesthouse that they’d run together. “I had a vision.” This US couple bought and renovated a 14th-century Italian home When he was unable to find anything that met his requirements, Kajiyama decided to shift his search to include the growing number of abandoned homes in the country. As younger people ditch rural areas in pursuit of jobs in the city, Japan’s countryside is becoming filled with “ghost” houses, or “akiya.” According to the Japan Policy Forum, there were 61 million houses and 52 million households in Japan in 2013, and with the country’s population expected to decline from 127 million to about 88 million by 2065, this number is likely to increase. Kajiyama was driving around Tamatori, a small village located in the Shizuoka prefecture, between Kyoto and Tokyo, surrounded by green tea plantations and rice fields, when he came across an elderly woman farming, and decided to approach her. “I said ‘Do you know if there are any empty houses around here?’ And she just pointed,” he recalls. He looked over at the area that she was signaling to and spotted two neglected houses side by side – a former green tea factory and an old farmer’s home – located close to a river. Both properties had been uninhabited for at least seven years and needed a huge amount of work. Kajiyama asked the woman to contact the owner to find out if they’d be interested in selling. “The owner said that no one could live there, as it was abandoned,” he says. “But he didn’t say ‘no.’ Everybody was always saying ‘no.’ But he didn’t. So I felt there was a small chance.” Expats buy Japanese country house for a song and get way more than they bargained for Kajiyama returned to visit the houses around five times, before going to visit the owner himself to negotiate an agreement that would see him use the old green tree factory as a home, and convert the farmer’s house into the guesthouse he’d always envisioned. While he was keen to purchase both of the homes, he explains that the traditions around home ownership in Japan mean that he is unable to do so until it’s passed down to the son of the current owner. “They said ‘if you take all the responsibility yourself, you can take it.’ So we made an agreement on paper,” he says. Both he and Hila were aware that they had a lot of work ahead of them, but the couple, who married in 2013, were thrilled to be one step closer to having their own guesthouse in an ideal spot. “It’s a very nice location,” says Kajiyama. “It’s close to the city, but it’s really countryside. Also people still live here and go to work [in the city]. “The house is also in front of the river, so when you go to sleep you can hear the sound of the water.” According to Kajiyama, the process of clearing the house, which is around 90 years old, before beginning the renovation works was one of the hardest parts of the process, simply because there was so much stuff to sort through. However, he was able to repurpose some of the items. During the first year, he spent a lot of time connecting with locals, gaining knowledge about the home, and helping the local farmers with farming for the first year or so. Although he wasn’t hugely experienced with renovation work, he had spent some time farming and completing building while he was backpacking, and had also taken odd jobs fixing peoples homes. He completed much of the work on the guesthouse himself, replacing the floors and adding in a toilet, which he says was a wedding present from his parents, at a cost of around $10,000. “I’m not really a professional,” he says.” I like to do carpentry and I enjoy creating things, but I have no experience in my background. “From my several years of backpacking, I saw so many interesting buildings, so many houses of interesting shapes and I’ve been collecting those in my brain.” Kajiyama was determined to keep the house as authentic as possible by using traditional materials. He saved money by collecting traditional wood from building companies who were in the process of breaking down traditional houses. “They need to spend the money to throw it away,” he explains. “But for me, some of the stuff is like treasure. So I would go and take the material that I wanted. “The house is a very, very old style,” he says. “So it wouldn’t look nice if I brought in more modern materials. It’s totally authentic.” He explains that very little work had previously been done to the house, which is quite unusual for a home built so many years ago. “It’s totally authentic,” he says. “Usually, with traditional houses, some renovations are made to the walls, because the insulation is not so strong. So you lose the style.” He says he received some financial support from the government, which meant he was able to bring in a carpenter and also benefited from Japan’s working holiday program, which allows travelers to work in exchange for food and board, when he needed extra help. After doing some research into Japanese guesthouse permits, he discovered that one of the simplest ways to acquire one would be to register the property as an agriculture guesthouse. As the area is filled with bamboo forests, this seemed like a no-brainer, and Kajiyama decided to learn everything he could about bamboo farming so that he could combine the two businesses. “This is how I started farming,” he says. In 2014, two years after they began working on the house, the couple were finally able to welcome their first guests. “It was a beautiful feeling,” says Kajiyama. “Of course, this was my dream. But people really appreciate that it was abandoned and I brought it back to life.” He says that hosting guests from all over the world has helped him to stay connected to his former life as a backpacker. “I stay in one place, but people come to me and I feel like I’m traveling,” he says. “Today, it’s Australia, tomorrow it’s the UK and next week South Africa and India. “People come from different places and they invite me to join them for dinner, so sometimes I join someone’s family life.” Sadly, Hila passed away from cancer in 2022. Kajiyama stresses that his beloved wife played a huge part in helping him achieve his dream of having a guesthouse and says he couldn’t have done it without her. “We were really together,” he adds. “She created this place with me. Without her it would not have been like this.” While the three-bedroom guesthouse, which measures around 80 square meters, has been open for around eight years, Kajiyama is still working on it, and says he has no idea when he’ll be finished. “It’s never ending,” he admits. “I’m halfway, I feel. It is beautiful already. But it started off abandoned, so it needs more details. And I’m getting better at creating, so I need time to do it.” He explains that he’s unable to complete work on the home while guests are there. And while the property is closed during the winter, he spends two months as a bamboo farmer and usually spends a month traveling, which doesn’t leave him much time for renovations. “Sometimes I don’t do anything,” he admits. Yui Valley, which offers activities such as bamboo weaving workshops, has helped to bring many travelers to the village of Tamatori over the years. “Most of the guests come after Tokyo, and it’s such a contrast,” he says. “They are really happy to share the nature and the tradition in our house. “Most people have dreamed of coming to Japan for a long time and they have a very short time here. “So they have such a beautiful energy. I’m happy to host in this way and join their holiday time. It’s very special [for me].” Kajiyama estimates that he’s spent around $40,000 on the renovation work so far, and if the feedback from guests, and locals, is anything to go by, it seems to have been money well spent. “People appreciate what I’ve done,” he adds. “So that makes me feel special.” As for Hiroko, the woman who pointed out the house to him over a decade ago, Kajiyama says she’s stunned at the transformation, and is amazed at how many international travelers are coming to Tamatori to stay at Yui Valley. “She cannot believe how much more beautiful it is [now],” he says. “She didn’t think it was going to be like this. So she really appreciates it. She says ‘thank you’ a lot.” Yui Valley, 1170 Okabecho Tamatori, Fujieda, Shizuoka 421-1101, Japan © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Due to its remoteness and short summer season, Mongolia has long been a destination overlooked by travelers. But as the country moves to further open up to tourism by easing its entry conditions for international visitors and upgrading its infrastructure, 2023 might just be the best time yet to get there. Here are 10 reasons travelers should start planning their long-dreamed-of Mongolia visit now. With the government of Mongolia declaring 2023 through 2025 the “Years to Visit Mongolia,” citizens from an additional 34 countries can now visit the country visa-free through the end of 2025. The addition of several European countries, including Denmark, France, Greece, Italy, Norway, Spain, and the UK, as well as Australia and New Zealand, now brings the total number of countries and territories on the visa-exempt list to 61. The full list is here. After years of delays, a pandemic and several controversies, the newly built Chinggis Khaan International Airport finally opened in the summer of 2021. With the ability to handle approximately 3 million passengers a year (double that of the old airport), the addition of 500 new aircraft parking spaces and the infrastructure to support an increase in domestic as well as budget flights, the airport is a welcome addition to the country’s efforts to grow tourism. Budget flights to Hong Kong from EZNIS Airways have been relaunched since the airport’s opening, and talks to resume direct flights to the United States are reportedly underway. The recently opened Chinggis Khaan Museum offers a beautiful, fresh look at Mongolia’s tumultuous history. With more than 10,000 artifacts spanning over 2,000 years, the museum explores the history of the Mongols and the empire they created – and eventually lost. The museum’s artifacts are presented over eight floors, with six permanent and two temporary exhibition halls. Guided tours are offered in English every Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. free of charge. When most people think of Mongolia, music festivals and conservation-focused art installations in the heart of one of the world’s largest deserts are the last things to come to mind. But that’s all changing thanks to festivals like Playtime, Spirit of Gobi, INTRO Electronic Music Festival and the Kharkhorum 360 Visual Art & Music Experience. Placing international bands, DJs, and musicians from around the world alongside Mongolia’s eclectic mix of rappers, bands and folk singers, the country just might be one of the world’s most underrated places for festival lovers. The annual Naadam event has always been a great reason to visit Mongolia, but now that the festival has just celebrated its 100 year anniversary, 2023 is as good a time as ever to attend. While the festival’s origins are rooted in the days of Genghis Khan, when he used horse racing, wrestling and archery competitions to keep his warriors in shape between battles, Naadam only officially became a national holiday 100 years ago. Today, the festival – held in Ulaanbaatar at the National Sports Stadium, has a few more bells and whistles than it did during the days of the Great Khan. A seat at July 11’s opening ceremony is always one of the hardest tickets to score in town. Mounted archery is seeing a resurgence in Mongolia thanks to guys like Altankhuyag Nergui, one of the most accomplished archers in the sport and his archery academy, Namnaa. Here, locals learn the fundamentals of Mongolian archery before mounting a horse and taking their new found skills to another level. In the summer months, students and academy members put on weekly shows for interested spectators. The academy also offers day-long training sessions for those wanting to try this intense sport. Speaking of giving life to Mongolia’s most ancient traditions, the resurrection of Mongol bichig, or the traditional Mongolian script written from top to bottom and read from left to right, has also seen a major resurgence in recent years. Visit the Erdenesiin Khuree Mongolian Calligraphy Center in Karakorum to learn from master calligraphist Tamir Samandbadraa Purev about this important cultural heritage. And, while you’re there, browse the yurts filled with Tamir’s works. Pair the release of Husqvarna’s new Norden 901 Expedition motorbike with Nomadic Off-Road’s newly announced Eagle Hunter Tour, and you have one of the fastest adventures in Mongolia. The tour takes six riders 1,700 kilometers from Ulaanbaatar to Bayan-Ulgii, where riders eventually meet their hosts, Mongolia’s famous eagle hunters. The only thing faster than this adventure is the rate at which Nomadic Off-Road’s tours sell out. Capturing the art of the last eagle hunters of Mongolia Professional musher Joel Rauzy has been leading dogsledding tours across the frozen Lake Khuvsgul for 18 years. With fewer crowds, lower hotel rates and the chance to see one of the largest freshwater lakes in the world completely frozen over, winter in Mongolia is something else to see and experience. Rauzy’s company, Wind of Mongolia, offers tours of the lake, where each person is assigned their own sled and dogs for the journey. Following Rauzy’s lead, mushers will make a loop of the lake. Activities include ice fishing, while travelers stay in winterized yurts and spend time with nomadic families along the journey. Nestled in the heart of Selenge province on the Yeruu River, Yeruu Lodge is the brainchild of Norwegian founder Eirik Gulsrud Johnsen, who first visited Mongolia in 2017. With a minimal Scandinavian-style restaurant and dining area, a handful of fully kitted out yurts for guests to stay in, two pétanque courts, kayaks, a driving range, mountain bikes and a yoga area, the lodge is a destination for nature lovers. Completely off-grid, the lodge runs off solar panels, uses of thermal heating, and all of the property’s water comes from an on-property well and is recycled after use. Additionally, all glass, metal and plastic used at the lodge is also recycled, and food waste is turned into compost used to grow vegetables, berries and herbs onsite. The lodge is set to open in April 2023. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved. CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."
1,2024-08-01 15:13:49.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-01 13:06:38.000,The most beautiful sections of China's Great Wall,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/china-beautiful-great-wall-sections-cmd/index.html,2023-09-18 02:57:08.000,"Editor’s Note: Monthly Ticket is a CNN Travel series that spotlights some of the most fascinating topics in the travel world. In September, we’re celebrating superlatives as we look at some of the world’s biggest, tallest and most expensive attractions and destinations. Having lived in Beijing for almost 12 years, I’ve had plenty of time to travel widely in China. I’ve visited more than 100 cities, not to mention countless towns and villages throughout the mainland’s 31 provinces. Looking back, I’ve come to realize it was my frequent visits to different parts of the Great Wall in Beijing that were a driving force behind my desire to explore the rest of the country and, along with it, the many sections of wall that lie outside the capital’s boundaries. Work on the Great Wall began more than 2,500 years ago, its origins dating back to China’s Spring and Autumn Period of around 770 BCE to 476 BCE. Various sections were added in subsequent eras as competing dynasties and factions sought to exert their control. Work eventually stopped in the 17th century. What's it like to walk the entire length of China's Great Wall? Though not a single, unbroken structure, the wall spans over 21,000 kilometers, winding through 15 provinces, 97 prefectures and 404 counties. And while certain sections have been incredibly popular among tourists, many parts have slipped into obscurity, disrepair and sometimes oblivion. Whether you’re planning to visit the Great Wall for the first time or the 50th, the following destinations are sure to make your trip to China even more worthwhile. (Check out the above video for dramatic aerial footage of some of these amazing sites.) The Great Wall is not simply a brick and mortar bulwark; in certain places, towers on jagged mountain peaks, fortress towns or even wide rivers count as sections of “wall.” The Turtle City, built in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) as part of the Great Wall’s “Yellow River Defense Line,” was completed in 1608 and was home to around 2,000 infantrymen and 500 cavalry units during peak use. Today, this fortress city is located in the Sitan Township of Jingtai County in north central Gansu province. While there aren’t many real turtles in the “Turtle City,” the garrison town got its nickname due to its unique shape. The south gate acts as the head and the west and east gates as the flippers. The town’s oval wall is the body, while the north gate acts as its tail. As one of the most well-preserved and truly authentic walled cities left in China today, it’s definitely worth your time. Staying in the Jingtai County center is recommended. The ancient city is only a 30-minute cab ride from your lodgings, so you can visit whenever the light is best for photos. When in Jingtai, try local specialties such as the five Buddha tofu and the Jingtai cold mixed noodles – both are spicy vegetarian dishes. A walk through the sprawling night market in Jingtai County People’s Square, which boasts more than 50 snack stalls, is also recommended for adventurous foodies. Regional Chinese food: 8 lesser-known cuisines worth trying Getting there: Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu province, has a major international airport and high-speed train connections from many cities in China. The drive to Yongtai Turtle City from downtown Lanzhou takes about 2.5 hours (195 kilometers). From Lanzhou Zhongchuan Airport, it’s only 1.5 hours (125 kilometers). Mutianyu and Jiankou are two parts of the same Stone Dragon – two contiguous sections of the Great Wall that together stretch for roughly 25 kilometers along Beijing’s mountaintops. Historical records show that millions of men spent centuries constructing the Great Wall. Stand atop the wall at either Mutianyu or Jiankou, and you’ll begin to comprehend the gravity of this statement. These two sections are arguably the two most classic examples of Ming Dynasty Great Wall surviving today, and climbing either is guaranteed to be a life-changing experience. Mutianyu is the best portion of the “tourist wall.” Restored in the 1980s, it’s very commercial but also superbly beautiful. Visitors not up for the hike can take a cable car to the top. Off-the-radar destinations every visitor to China should consider To the west of Mutianyu, Jiankou is colloquially known as the “wild wall” – no ticket needed and not commercialized. That being said, as of 2020, hiking at Jiankou has become somewhat frowned upon by the local government because of safety concerns. Mutianyu and Jiankou are less than a 90-minute drive (without traffic) from downtown Beijing, yet it’s highly recommended to enjoy a night in the countryside if time allows. Jiankou can be accessed via Xizhazi village; if dates align, you might even be able to spend a few days with William Lindesay, world-renowned Great Wall historian, and his wonderful family at The Barracks, their wall-side courtyard home. For lodgings around Mutianyu, The Brickyard is a superbly comfortable choice. In fall and spring, shades of the wall’s gray brick contrast with nature’s vibrant colors. Peak autumn foliage and spring cherry blossoms provide stunning backdrops for photos. For winter sports enthusiasts, there’s skiing and skating next to the Wall at locations not far from Mutianyu. Getting to Mutianyu: Restrictions on applying for temporary driving licenses in China were relaxed in September 2019, so renting a car as a foreign tourist is entirely possible. (International driving licenses are not accepted in China.) You can also hire a car with a driver for the day or take the Mutianyu Special Tourism Bus from the Dongzhimen Wai Bus Station. Getting to Jiankou: Renting a car or booking private transport is recommended. As Xizhazi is a small village, buses are scarce so it can take up to five hours to get there by public transport, as opposed to 90 minutes by car. Bataizi village sits just inside the Motianling section of the Great Wall and is home to the ruins of a Gothic church built in 1876 under the direction of a German missionary. The church has been damaged and repaired numerous times in its nearly 150-year history; the bell tower is the only part still standing. The juxtaposition of its ruins against the rammed-earth Great Wall makes Bataizi a unique place to spend a morning or afternoon. China's best new outdoor attractions After finishing your hike along the wall and visiting the church ruins, drop in to the village’s “new” church to say hello to Father Pan; if you speak Chinese, he can answer any questions about the village’s long connection with Catholicism. Besides Bataizi, Datong should also be on your tourist map; visiting the Yungang Grottoes (a UNESCO world heritage site) and the Hengshan Hanging Temple will make your trip even more memorable. Late summer is an ideal time to visit Bataizi, as you’ll see a wonderful contrast between the Great Wall and the lush green hills. Getting there: Bataizi village is 80 kilometers west of Datong, one of Shanxi province’s largest and most famous cities. Zuoyun County is only 22 kilometers away from Bataizi – about a 35-minute drive. Datong is easily accessible by plane or high-speed train from other cities in China; a taxi from downtown Datong to Bataizi should cost roughly 300 yuan (about $43). Alternatively, you can make your way to Zuoyun County by bus then hop in a taxi. In Datong, luxury seekers will want to head for the five-star Yunzhong Traditional Courtyard Hotel. Zuoyun County has one hotel that can accept foreigners: Zuoyun Jinshan International Hotel. Both can be found on popular hotel booking sites. As the locals say, Laoniuwan is where the Great Wall and the mighty Yellow River shake hands. The Laoniuwan Fortress was built in 1467, while the most famous tower of the Great Wall in this area, Wanghe Tower (literally meaning river-watching tower), was constructed in 1544. Laoniuwan village is located in Pianguan County, part of Xinzhou city in Shanxi province, just across the river from Inner Mongolia. Late summer or early fall is a great time to visit, as you’ll avoid the potentially dangerous mountain roads during spring rainstorms, or being uncomfortably cold in a place without great infrastructure. Along the Great Wall, there are only a few places where it meets bodies of water; of all those, this is the most stunning. A boat ride along the river is highly recommended. You’ll be able to soak in the natural beauty of the Yellow River Gorge while marveling at the steadfast resolve of these ancient architects. Swell life: China's surf scene is heating up Getting there: Laoniuwan is difficult to get to by public transportation. The best option is to rent or book a car to take you from Datong to Laoniuwan via Bataizi – this way, you’ll be able to see two incredible locations along the Great Wall in one trip. Pianguan is the nearest city, about one hour away. Pianguan does not have a train station or an airport. The only option is to arrive by bus. Shuozhou, 140 kilometers from Laoniuwan, has an airport opening later this year. Construction on the Great Wall in Simatai began in 1373. It was expanded and reinforced periodically throughout the Ming Dynasty. The Fairy Tower is one of the best-known towers of the wall at Simatai but also one of the least visited due to how difficult it is to access. Instead, aim to take in incredible views of the Fairy Tower from Wangjing Tower (just a few hundred meters away). It’s a journey that will satiate even the most adventurous hikers, yet can be done without any ropes, ladders or other essential safety gear. As with a visit to Mutianyu/Jiankou, this section of wall is guaranteed to deliver stunning views any time of year. My only suggestion is to wait for a clear day (usually visibility is great the day after it rains or snows), as the view from Wangjing Tower is unobstructed in every direction. The hike to the Fairy Tower will leave you in awe of the Northern Barbarians’ supposed determination to reach the capital; the mountains are nearly impassable on foot, let alone by horse, with sheer cliff faces on either side. It makes for absolutely world-class hiking and an interesting history lesson. Five-star lodgings are available at Hobo Farm; they also have an incredible restaurant that serves delicious Western and Chinese fare. For 4.5 star lodgings with a lower price tag, try Yatou’s Homestay. Both can be found on major hotel booking sites. Getting there: Both the Fairy Tower and Wangjing Tower should be accessed via Tangjiazhai village, located in Beijing’s Miyun district. Tangjiazhai village is 140 kilometers from downtown Beijing, depending on your route. Booking a private car from the city is probably the most time-effective way to get there. You can also take a high-speed train from Beijing Station to Miyun district and switch to a bus or taxi from there. Constructed during the reign of Emperor Jiajing (1507-1567), this single-wall section stands seven meters tall in some spots – no small feat considering it was made by piling stones. It’s located just across the road from the town of Dushikou, in Chicheng in Hebei province. The piled-stone wall at Dushikou is unique, as many other sections of the Great Wall close to Beijing were constructed using kiln-fired bricks. Dushikou is best visited in the summer, specifically July and August, when the rolling hills of the surrounding grasslands are peak green. Cool evenings make for perfect outdoor barbecue/bonfire weather. You’ll be able to find clean and comfortable farmhouse lodgings in Dushikou town; alternatively, Chicheng, 45 minutes away, has a range of hotels to choose from. Lamb skewers and roast leg of lamb are specialties in these parts, as this part of Hebei is very close to the border with Inner Mongolia. Noodle lovers should also try the local oat noodles, which are delicious. Getting there: Thanks to all the infrastructure built for the 2022 Winter Olympics, the drive to Dushikou has been shortened by almost two hours. If you prefer not to drive, hop on a bus to Chicheng from the Liuliqiao Transport Hub in Beijing and take a 45-minute taxi ride to Dushikou. Note that public transportation will take one or two hours longer than private car. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

Related gallery Inside 2022's 'CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute' Online voters selected her from among this year’s Top 10 CNN Heroes. Cheboi’s nonprofit, TechLit Africa, has provided thousands of students across rural Kenya with access to donated, upcycled computers — and the chance at a brighter future. Cheboi accepted the award with her mother, who she said “worked really hard to educate us.” At the beginning of her acceptance speech, Cheboi and her mother sang a song onstage that she explained had a special meaning when she was growing up. As CNN Hero of the Year, Cheboi will receive $100,000 to expand her work. She and the other top 10 CNN Heroes honored at Sunday’s gala all receive a $10,000 cash award and, for the first time, additional grants, organizational training and support from The Elevate Prize Foundation through a new collaboration with CNN Heroes. Nelly will also be named an Elevate Prize winner, which comes with a $300,000 grant and additional support worth $200,000 for her nonprofit. Cheboi grew up in poverty in Mogotio, a rural township in Kenya. “I know the pain of poverty,” said Cheboi, 29. “I never forgot what it was like with my stomach churning because of hunger at night.” A hard-working student, Cheboi received a full scholarship to Augustana College in Illinois in 2012. She began her studies there with almost no experience with computers, handwriting papers and struggling to transcribe them onto a laptop.

I knew that this is something that I wanted to do as my career, and also bring it to my community,” she told CNN. Many basic computer skills were still a steep learning curve, however. Cheboi remembers having to practice touch-typing for six months before she could pass a coding interview. Touch-typing is a skill that is now a core part of the TechLit curriculum. “I feel so accomplished seeing kids that are 7 years old touch-typing, knowing that I just learned how to touch-type less than five years ago,” she said. Once she had begun working in the software industry, Cheboi soon realized the extent of which computers were being thrown away as companies upgraded their technology infrastructure.

So, in 2018, she began transporting donated computers back to Kenya — in her personal luggage, handling customs fees and taxes herself. “At one point, I was bringing 44 computers, and I paid more for the luggage than I did for the air ticket,” she said. A year later, she co-founded TechLit Africa with a fellow software engineer after both quit their jobs. The nonprofit accepts computer donations from companies, universities and individuals. The hardware is wiped and refurbished before it’s shipped to Kenya. There, it’s distributed to partner schools in rural communities, where students ages 4 to 12 receive daily classes and frequent opportunities to learn from professionals, gaining skills that will help improve their education and better prepare them for future jobs. “We have people who own a specific skill coming in and are just inspiring the kids (with) music production, video production, coding, personal branding,” Cheboi said. “They can go from doing a remote class with NASA on education to music production.” The organization currently serves 10 schools; within the next year, Cheboi hopes to be partnered with 100 more. “My hope is that when the first TechLit kids graduate high school, they’re able to get a job online because they will know how to code, they will know how to do graphic design, they will know how to do marketing,” Cheboi said. “The world is your oyster when you are educated. By bringing the resources, by bringing these skills, we are opening up the world to them.” CNN’s Anderson Cooper and ABC’s Kelly Ripa co-hosted the 16th Annual “CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute,” which featured more than a dozen celebrity presenters. “We’re so deeply honored to be here,” said actress and singer Sofia Carson, who perfomed a song with award-winning songwriter Diane Warren at the event. “Diane wrote this incredible anthem ‘Applause’ for those leading, surviving and fighting and tonight we dedicate this song and performance to our heroes.” Actor Aubrey Plaza introduced CNN Hero Aidan Reilly, who launched his nonprofit while home from college during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic. “From his pandemic couch, Aidan and his friends co-founded Farmlink Project,” Plaza said. The nonprofit connects excess food from farms across the US – food that would otherwise be wasted – to those who need it. “In just two years, he .. has moved more than 70 million pounds,” Plaza added.

2,2024-08-01 15:13:49.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 13:13:40.000,"Hamas military chief was killed in July strike, Israel says",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv3gpy74ydo,2024-08-01 13:09:42.000,"Israel's military says it has confirmed that Hamas's military chief Mohammed Deif was killed in an Israeli air strike in the Gaza Strip last month. Deif was targeted in the strike on a compound in the Khan Younis area on 13 July. Hamas is yet to confirm his death. Israel says Deif was one of the figures responsible for planning the 7 October attacks in southern Israel in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. On Wednesday, Hamas political leader Ismael Haniyeh was killed during a visit to Iran. Israel has not commented on his death directly. In a statement on Thursday, the Israeli military said that ""following an intelligence assessment, it can be confirmed that Mohammed Deif was eliminated"" in the 13 July strike. Gaza’s Hamas-run health authorities said at the time that the air strike had killed more than 90 people, but denied that Deif was among the dead. Deif was widely seen as the second-ranking Hamas official in Gaza, behind Yahya Sinwar, the group's leader in the territory. Israel’s Defence Minister, Yoav Gallant, said the death of Deif is “a significant milestone” in the dismantling of Hamas. ""This operation reflects the fact that Hamas is disintegrating, and that Hamas terrorists may either surrender or they will be eliminated,"" he added. Mohammed Deif was appointed head of the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the military arm of the Hamas movement, in 2002. For decades he's been seen as one of Israel's most wanted men - and survived a reported seven assassination attempts. Reports in Israeli and Palestinian media say that Deif was born in Gaza's Khan Yunis refugee camp in 1965, when the territory was occupied by Egypt. As a young man in the 1980s, he joined Hamas and quickly rose to prominence. Israel accused him of planning and supervising bus bombings which killed tens of Israelis in 1996, and of involvement in the capture and killing of three Israeli soldiers in the mid-1990s.  Deif is also known to have helped engineer the construction of tunnels that have allowed Hamas fighters to enter Israel from Gaza. In 2014, Israel attempted to kill Deif with an air strike on a house in the Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood of Gaza, which killed Deif's wife, Widad, and their infant son, Ali. Israel thought it had killed Deif, too, but he was not in the building at the time. During the current conflict, Deif is believed to have directed Hamas' military operations from within underground tunnels inside Gaza.  Israel's confirmation of Deif's death comes at the end of a turbulent week in the Israel-Gaza conflict, which has stoked fears of a broader regional war. On Saturday, 12 Druze children and young people were killed after a rocket fell on a football field in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed Lebanon-based Hezbollah, saying they would pay ""a heavy price"". On Tuesday, Israel retorted with air strike on Beirut which killed senior Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr, as well as four others, including two children. Hours later, Hamas’s political leader Ismael Haniyeh was killed in a strike on a building he was staying in during a visit to Iran’s capital, Tehran. Benjamin Netanyahu warned Israel that ""challenging days lies ahead"" after Iran threatened ""harsh punishment"". The Hamas leader was assassinated in Tehran, and it is widely believed Israel was behind the killing. Widely considered the group's overall leader, Haniyeh had been a prominent member since the late 1980s. Ismail Haniyeh was elected head of Hamas's political bureau in 2017. As Hamas's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh was a key interlocutor in the Gaza ceasefire negotiations. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

2,2024-08-01 15:13:49.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 13:13:40.000,Hamas leader's funeral draws crowds in Iran,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz5rd0p2lxeo,2024-08-01 08:55:11.000,"Thousands have turned out for the funeral procession in Iran of the Hamas political chief, Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in a strike in Tehran on Wednesday. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, led prayers for the Hamas leader, whose body will be buried in Qatar. US media have quoted Iranian officials as saying the supreme leader has ordered a direct attack against Israel, which it says was responsible for the attack on Iranian soil. Israel has not commented on the assassination directly. However, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country had delivered “crushing blows” to its enemies in recent days, including the killing of a senior Hezbollah commander in Lebanon hours before the Tehran strike. He warned Israelis that “challenging days lie ahead”, as fears of a wider conflict in the Middle East grow. ""Since the strike in Beirut, we have heard threats from all sides,"" he told a televised address. ""We are prepared for any scenario and we will stand united and determined."" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned against a ""dangerous escalation"" of hostilities in the region. Hamas's armed wing said the death of Haniyeh, who was widely viewed as the group's overall leader, would ""take the battle to new dimensions"" and have major repercussions. While Haniyeh's funeral was still taking place, Israel's military said it had confirmed that Hamas's military chief, Mohammed Deif, was killed in an air strike in the Gaza Strip last month. Deif was targeted in the strike on a compound in the Khan Younis area on 13 July. Hamas is yet to confirm his death. Israel says Deif was one of the figures responsible for planning the 7 October attacks in southern Israel in which 1,200 people were killed. Since the attack, Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas. Haniyeh, who played an important role in negotiations over a ceasefire in Gaza, was killed hours after attending the inauguration of Iran's new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, in Tehran. A senior Hamas official told the BBC the killing took place in the same building where Haniyeh had stayed during previous visits to Iran. Three Hamas leaders and a number of guards were with him in the same building, they said. Khalil Al-Hayya, a senior Hamas official, told a news conference that a missile hit Haniyeh ""directly"", citing witnesses who were with him. The group's leadership has been left in ""a state of shock"", top Hamas officials have told the BBC. Hours before Haniyeh was targeted, Israel said it had killed senior Hezbollah leader Fuad Shukr in Beirut. Israel believes he was responsible for a rocket attack that killed 12 people in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Saturday. Hezbollah has denied any involvement. The Iran-backed group confirmed Shukr's body was found among the rubble of the residential building which was struck. Four other people, including two children, were killed. Benjamin Netanyahu warned Israel that ""challenging days lies ahead"" after Iran threatened ""harsh punishment"". Israel had accused Fuad Shukr, a top Hezbollah commanders, of masterminding operations against Israel. The Hamas leader was assassinated in Tehran, and it is widely believed Israel was behind the killing. Iran says it will avenge the killing of Hamas's Ismail Haniyeh - but what will that mean in practice? The UN said a ""staggering number"" of Palestinians have been detained by Israel, with many facing torture and abuse. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

2,2024-08-01 15:13:49.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 13:13:40.000,Bowen: Israel's killing of Haniyeh deals hammer blow to ceasefire prospects,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp4wgqypwrxo,2024-07-31 19:04:05.000,"Israel has inflicted two devastating blows on its enemies. It has not confirmed that it killed the Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, but it is hard to see who else would have wanted him dead more than the Israelis. As for the Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr, Israel says he was killed in Beirut in an “intelligence-based elimination”. For Israel, everyone senior in Hamas is a legitimate target after the attacks of 7 October 2023, which inflicted the worst single day of bloodshed on Israel since independence in 1948. Fuad Shukr, Israel says, was killed because as a veteran Hezbollah commander he was responsible for the rocket attack that killed 12 children and young people in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Hezbollah has confirmed he was killed in the raid on Beirut. It denies carrying out the attack in the Golan. Once again, the Middle East is full of speculation that the all-out war feared since 7 October is imminent. The deadly irony is no side wants that war, but increasingly they are prepared to risk it. The Israelis have been under pressure from their American allies to calibrate their response to Hezbollah, inflicting a blow that will hurt the group without provoking a devastating retaliation and igniting a wider and deeper war. But two assassinations amount to a major gamble. The leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, might still decide that an attack on their stronghold in southern Beirut warrants a matching attack on Tel Aviv. Israel might also have calculated that Iran would not go to war over an assassinated Palestinian leader, even though his death in their capital, under their protection, is a humiliation. Killing Haniyeh, just after he had met the new Iranian president, is a dramatic display of Israel’s reach. The Islamic Republic thought it re-established deterrence when it fired hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel in April - that claim has now been exposed as hollow. April’s barrage was also retaliation, for the Israeli air strike that killed two Iranian generals in Iran’s embassy in Damascus. More retaliation looks certain from Iran, its ally Hezbollah or one of its proxies. Pro-Iranian militias in Iraq have made it clear that they blame the US equally for what has happened. In the Red Sea, the Houthis might redouble their attacks out of Yemen. There are limits to what Hamas can do, after months of the Israeli onslaught in Gaza. But the Israelis are on high alert for attacks in the occupied West Bank or inside Israel itself. It is important to realise that the Middle East is already in a regional war, but also to recognise that it could get much worse. Even so, this round of killing and retaliation might not be the spark that ignites all-out war, though it is easy to construct scenarios based on the clear and dangerous risks and realities in the world’s most turbulent region. Pulling back from the brink, repeatedly, is not making war any less likely. It makes it harder to construct a diplomatic pathway away from the looming threat of all-out conflict. The only credible first step for lowering the deadly temperature in the Middle East is a ceasefire in Gaza. In recent weeks the Americans have said that it was getting closer. That was always hard to imagine while the two sides’ definitions of an acceptable ceasefire were so far apart. For Hamas, a ceasefire meant an Israeli withdrawal and the end of hostilities. For Israel, it meant a pause that allowed for the release of some or all of the surviving hostages, and the right to resume the war afterwards. Now a ceasefire in Gaza looks as far away as ever, although the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said again that it remains America’s diplomatic priority. Ismail Haniyeh was a leading figure on the Hamas side in the ceasefire talks. With his colleagues, he communicated with the US and Israel via the head of the Egyptian secret service and the prime minister of Qatar, Sheikh Mohamed bin Jassim al Thani. The prime minister posted his response to the assassination of Haniyeh on X, writing: “Political assassinations and continued targeting of civilians in Gaza while talks continue leads us to ask how mediation can succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on the other side.” The assassination fits more closely into Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s conception of “total victory” over Hamas than into the American idea that a ceasefire is vital to avoid an even deeper regional catastrophe. It will also strengthen the belief held by Mr Netanyahu’s critics inside and outside Israel that he wants to prolong the war, to avoid the moment when he faces a reckoning of the mistakes he made that allowed Hamas the space to attack with such devastating consequences on 7 October. The Americans and French have also worked hard to find a diplomatic way to stop the border war between Israel and Hezbollah. But the vital first step would be a ceasefire in Gaza, and the prospect one was close has taken another hammer blow. Hamas has not confirmed the death of Mohammed Deif, who led the group's military wing. Iran has threatened “harsh punishment” for Israel, which it blames for Ismail Haniyeh's assassination in Tehran. Israel had accused Fuad Shukr, a top Hezbollah commanders, of masterminding operations against Israel. Widely considered the group's overall leader, Haniyeh had been a prominent member since the late 1980s. Ismail Haniyeh was elected head of Hamas's political bureau in 2017. Copyright 2024 BBC.

2,2024-08-01 15:13:49.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 13:13:40.000,Three men accused of plotting 9/11 reach plea deal - Pentagon,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cldy01z6xnpo,2024-08-01 10:21:29.000,"Three of the men accused of plotting the 11 September 2001 attacks on the US have entered into a pre-trial agreement, the Department of Defense says. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Walid Muhammad Salih Mubarak Bin Attash, and Mustafa Ahmed Adam al-Hawsawi have been held at the US Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for years without going to trial. Details of the deal have not been announced, but US news outlets say the men will plead guilty in exchange for the prosecution agreeing not to seek the death penalty. Nearly 3,000 people in New York, Virginia and Pennsylvania were killed in the attacks, which sparked the ""War on Terror"" and the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. Brett Eagleson, the president of 9/11 Justice, an organisation that represents 9/11 survivors and relatives of victims, said in a statement provided to the BBC that the families are “deeply troubled by these plea deals”. He said the process lacked transparency and urged the authorities to pursue more information on the role of Saudi Arabia in the attacks. Terry Strada, who lost her husband Tom, told the BBC’s Today Programme: ""It was a gut-punch to hear that there was a plea deal today that was giving the detainees in Guantanamo Bay what they want.” Ms Strada, the national chair of the campaign group 9/11 Families United, added: ""This is a victory for Khalid Sheikh Mohammad and the other two, it's a victory for them,"" she said.  The 9/11 attacks were the deadliest assault on US soil since the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, where 2,400 people were killed. The plea deal was first announced in a letter sent by prosecutors to the families of victims, according to The New York Times. It said the plea before a military court could come as early as next week. In its announcement, the US defence department said ""the specific terms and conditions of the pretrial agreements are not available to the public at this time"". The men have been accused of a litany of charges, including attacking civilians, murder in violation of the laws of war, hijacking and terrorism. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is widely considered the architect of the attack, in which hijackers seized passenger planes and crashed them into the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon outside of Washington. A fourth plane crashed into a field in Pennsylvania after passengers fought back. Mohammed, a US-educated engineer, was captured along with Hawsawi in Pakistan in March 2003. Prosecutors argued that he brought his idea of hijacking and flying planes into US buildings to al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, and later helped recruit and train some of the hijackers. He was subjected to a number of ""enhanced interrogation techniques"", including waterboarding - simulated drowning - at least 183 times before the practice was banned by the US government. The trial has been delayed for so long partly because of fears that the so-called brutal interrogation techniques which critics say amounted to torture could have undermined the evidence against the detainees. “This is the least bad deal in the real world that would ever happen,” national security analyst Peter Bergen told CNN. In September, the Biden administration reportedly rejected the terms of a plea deal with five men held at the US Navy base in Cuba, including Mohammed. The men had reportedly sought a guarantee from the president that they would not be kept in solitary confinement and would have access to trauma treatment. The White House National Security Council said that the president's office was told on Wednesday of the new deal and had played no role in negotiations. Fifteen of the 19 plane hijackers were Saudi nationals and families are bringing a lawsuit against the kingdom, which denies any involvement. Republicans were quick to attack the Biden administration for striking a deal with the accused. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell condemned the move as ""a revolting abdication of the government's responsibility to defend America and provide justice"". ""The only thing worse than negotiating with terrorists is negotiating with them after they are in custody,"" he said. The exchange of 24 prisoners between Russia and the West will be the largest since the Cold War. The world anti-doping agency says it is ""unfairly caught"" in US-China geopolitical tensions.

2,2024-08-01 15:13:49.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 13:13:40.000,'Is she black or Indian?': Trump questions Harris' racial identity,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c06k07dn1zjo,2024-07-31 21:28:44.000,"Donald Trump has questioned Kamala Harris' racial identity during a heated exchange at a convention for black journalists. Trump falsely claimed the vice-president and presumptive Democratic nominee had only emphasised her Asian-American heritage until recently when, he claimed, ""she became a black person"". ""I didn't know she was black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn black and now she wants to be known as black,"" he said at the National Association of Black Journalists convention in Chicago on Wednesday. ""So I don't know - Is she Indian? Or is she black?"" Ms Harris said Trump's remarks were ""the same old show"" of ""divisiveness... and disrespect"". ""The American people deserve better,"" she told a meeting of the historically black sorority Sigma Gamma Rho in Houston. ""We deserve a leader who understands that our differences do not divide us - they are an essential source of our strength."" Ms Harris is the first black and Asian-American vice-president, with Indian and Jamaican-born parents. She attended Howard University, a historically black university, and joined the predominantly black Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. She became a member of Congressional Black Caucus after entering the Senate in 2017. Trump's claims prompted a heated exchange with ABC News' correspondent Rachel Scott, one of the moderators of the Chicago event. ""I respect either one,"" the Republican said in reference to Harris' racial identity. ""But she obviously doesn't because she was Indian all the way and then all of a sudden she made a turn and she became a black person."" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said no-one ""has any right to tell someone who they are, how they identify. That is no-one's right."" ""Since when is Donald Trump, with his long and ugly history of racism, the arbiter of Blackness?"" congressman Ritchie Torres of New York posted on X. He described Trump as a “relic of a racist past"". The Republican nominee and former president has a history of attacking his opponents on the basis of race. He falsely accused Barack Obama, the country's first black president, of not being born in the US. Trump attacked the former UN ambassador and his Republican primary opponent Nikki Haley by falsely claiming she could not be president because her parents were not US citizens when she was born. Ms Harris has faced a series of attacks since becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee. Republicans have criticised the decision, saying she was chosen only because of her race. Tim Burchett, a Republican congressman from Tennessee, called her a ""DEI vice-president"" - a reference to diversity, equity and inclusion programmes. On Wednesday, Scott pushed Trump to clarify whether he believed Ms Harris was a ""DEI hire"". He replied: ""I really don't know, could be."" Ms Harris has described growing up engaged with her Indian heritage and often visited the country. Her mother also immersed her two daughters in the black culture of Oakland, California - where she was raised, she said. Trump also attacked Ms Harris' credentials during the discussion, saying she had failed her bar exam early in her legal career. His comments were met with murmurs from the crowd. ""I'm just giving you the facts. She didn't pass her bar exam and she didn't think she would pass it and she didn't think she was going to ever pass it and I don't know what happened. Maybe she passed it,"" he said. Ms Harris graduated from the University of California Hastings College of Law in 1989. The New York Times reported that she failed her first attempt and passed at the second. The state bar of California says fewer than half of those who sit the test pass on the first attempt. The Chicago discussion began with a contentious back and forth between Scott and the former president. Trump accused the journalist of giving a ""very rude introduction"" when she began the conversation asking about his past criticism of black people.

2,2024-08-01 15:13:49.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 13:13:40.000,Why the world's anti-doping agency feels stuck between US and China,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2gygj1d28o,2024-08-01 00:53:05.000,"The World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) says it is ""unfairly caught"" in a row between the US and China, with their geopolitical tensions spilling onto the Olympic stage. China's top swimmers have been in the spotlight after a slew of doping allegations, followed by contentious US claims that Wada was covering it up. Chinese swimmers headed to Paris were drug-tested twice as much as some other nations, which, in turn, has fuelled accusations of a conspiracy to disrupt their performance. Wada said in its statement on Tuesday that it had been caught in ""the middle of geopolitical tensions between superpowers but has no mandate to participate in that"". ""Certain individuals [in the US] are attempting to score political points purely on the basis that the athletes in question are Chinese,"" Wada head of media relations James Fitzgerald told the BBC. ""The result is that it has created distrust and division within the anti-doping system."" A trade war, geopolitical rivalries and Beijing's friendship with Russia have soured relations between the world's two largest economies. It's little surprise that some of those tensions play out in competitive sports but now they appear to be driving a harder - and harsher - wedge. Last week, Wada had said it was considering legal action against its US counterpart, Usada, over ""defamatory"" accusations. The latter had accused Wada and China's anti-doping agency, Chinada, of being among the ""dirty hands in burying positive tests and suppressing the voices of courageous whistleblowers"". US lawmakers, too, have accused Wada of failing to investigate doping allegations against Chinese swimmers properly. And on Tuesday they introduced a bill that would give the White House power to cut funding to the agency. ""When members of congress and senators are inserting themselves into the largely technical world of anti-doping, it ceases to be about scientific and legal analysis, and it drifts into the political realm,"" said Mr Fitzgerald. Wada's statement on Tuesday followed reports in the New York Times about a previously undisclosed case involving two Chinese swimmers - including one on this year’s Olympic team - who were investigated for doping. They had tested positive for a banned steroid in 2022, but they were cleared to compete. China's anti-doping agency concluded that the athletes had most likely consumed the steroid unknowingly while eating contaminated burgers. Usada accused Wada of letting China ""compete under a different set of rules, tilting the field in their favour"". But Wada defended the decision. It said the athletes’ nutritional supplements and hair tests had returned negative results, and that both swimmers also provided control samples that were negative in the days before and after the one test that was positive. It added that the two swimmers were suspended for more than a year and then their cases were closed. Their cases are part of a ""wider series of cases involving [Chinese] athletes from different sports"", the agency said, adding that, ""based on the number of cases, clearly there is an issue of contamination in several countries around the world"". In a statement in June, Wada noted that athletes who eat meat sometimes test positive for drugs if they have ingested clenbuterol, a banned substance which is used as a growth promoter for farm animals. That statement, in response to questions from the New York Times, said the agency was investigating instances of contamination in China as well as Mexico, Guatemala and other countries. The agency's boss Olivier Niggli pointed out at the time that US media had ""only asked questions about China when meat contamination is an issue in many countries"", and referred to ""attempts to politicise anti-doping"". All of this follows a bigger controversy in April, when the New York Times reported that 23 Chinese swimmers had tested positive for a performance-enhancing drug months before the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. But they were cleared to compete after Chinese officials found the results were caused by contamination. The 30-member team went on to win six medals, inlcuding three golds in Tokyo. Eleven of those who tested positive were also picked to be part of the Chinese swimming team for the Paris Olympics. US swimmer and 11-time Olympic medalist Katie Ledecky had said her confidence in anti-doping regulators was at an ""all-time low"" after the news about the 23 Chinese swimmers. Wada's investigation, however, found that it was ""not in a position to disprove the possibility that contamination"" was the source of the drug, heart medication trimetazidine (TMZ). It said the contamination theory was supported by ""the combination of the consistently low concentrations of TMZ as well as no doping pattern"" among the tested athletes. That is, their test results over several days were not consistent, veering between negative and positive. An independent investigation found that Wada did not mishandle the case or show bias towards the Chinese swimmers. The scandals upped the pressure on anti-doping officals and by the time the Chinese swimming team arrived in Paris, they were being tested far more than is standard. Since January, each of the team's 31 members have been tested, on average, 21 times by various anti-doping organisations, according to World Aquatics, which oversees water sports. In comparison, Australia's 41 swimmers have been tested an average of four times and the 46 US swimmers, an average of six times. The flurry of tests has sparked another set of allegations. The state-run Chinese newspaper the Global Times blames Western powers for ""abusing doping tests to disrupt [the] Chinese swimming team"". Speaking to the Global Times, an international politics professor in Shanghai, accused the US of dominating anti-doping rules. Shen Yi suggested that the ""relentless and unethical testing"" had disrupted the Chinese team's training, which she called a ""disgrace to the Olympics"". Chinese swimmer Qin Haiyang, who holds the world record for the 200m men's breastroke, said this testing ""proves that European and American teams feel threatened by the performances of the Chinese team in recent years"". ""Some tricks aim to disrupt our preparation rhythm and destroy our psychological defence. But we are not afraid,"" he said on Chinese social media platform Weibo. Qin, who won golds in the 50m, 100m and 200m breaststroke at the world championships last year, finished in seventh place in the men's 100m breaststroke final on Sunday. This criticism was echoed by former Chinese diving champion Gao Min who said the rigorous testing had ""disrupted our Chinese swimming team"" and called Qin's performance ""the worst in any competition over the past two years”. China's current medal tally stands at one gold, two silver and two bronze. China's “butterfly queen”, Zhang Yufei, who won a silver in the 100m event in Tokyo, was in tears over her bronze finish on Monday but said the doping tests did not have a big impact on her. While they were a ""bit annoying"", she said it was the pressure that was ""far greater"" than she had imagined.

2,2024-08-01 15:13:49.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 13:13:40.000,Maduro promises voting data as observers say Venezuela election 'not democratic',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxx28wex0w6o,2024-08-01 04:30:31.000,"Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has insisted his party is ready to present all the vote tallies from his country's disputed election after election observers said it ""could not be considered democratic"". The National Electoral Council (CNE) declaration that Mr Maduro won has sparked two days of protests, with the country's opposition saying voting tallies show its candidate, Edmundo González, won by a wide margin. NGOs say there have been at least 11 deaths in protest-related violence and that dozens more have been injured. Speaking to journalists on Wednesday, Mr Maduro said again that his government’s reason for not publishing the electoral results was because of a “hack” on the electoral council website. He also claimed he had “proof” that the opposition leader, María Corina Machado, was behind “violence”. He alleged that protesters were ""attacking"" the constitution and asked the Supreme Court to take action, which could pave the way for more mass arrests of opposition figures or protesters. Top US diplomat for Latin America, Brian Nichols, said the evidence showed President Maduro overwhelmingly lost by ""millions"" of votes - endorsing vote tallies released by his opponents. ""The tabulation of these detailed results clearly show an irrefutable result: Edmundo González won with 67% of these votes compared to 30% for Maduro,"" he said in remarks at an Organisation of American States (OAS) meeting, AFP reported. ""While not a total result, there are not enough votes in remaining tally sheets... to overcome such a deficit,"" he continued. Earlier on Wednesday the US-based Carter Center - which was invited by Venezuelan officials to monitor Sunday's presidential poll - said it could not ""verify or corroborate the results of the election declared by CNE"". The Carter Center also said that the CNE's failure to announce the detailed results by polling station ""constitutes a serious breach of electoral principles"". It added that the CNE had ""demonstrated a clear bias in favour of the incumbent [President Nicolás Maduro]"" and accused the CNE of a ""complete lack of transparency in announcing the results"". With its statement, the Carter Center has joined a long list of countries and organisations pressuring the CNE to release detailed voting data at the polling station level, among them the US, Brazil and the EU. The US state department said the international community was running out of patience waiting for Venezuelan electoral authorities to release full detailed data on their country's election. The Carter Center statement is embarrassing for the Maduro government because its observers had been complimentary about the Venezuelan electoral system in the past. President Maduro has often quoted a remark by the Carter Center's founder, former US President Jimmy Carter, who in 2012 said that ""of the 92 elections that we've monitored, I would say the election process in Venezuela is the best in the world"". More than 1,000 people have so far been detained, according to Venezuela's attorney general, who also said that two members of the security forces had died in the protests. Ms Machado has urged her supporters to remain peaceful even if provoked by the government and its allies. On Tuesday, a close ally of President Maduro, National Assembly leader Jorge Rodríguez, called for the arrest of Ms Machado and Mr González, accusing them of leading a ""fascist conspiracy"". President Maduro told media on Wednesday Ms Machado and Mr González ""should be behind bars"", AFP reported. The Costa Rican foreign minister later offered Ms Machado and Mr González political asylum, saying that his government ""had been informed of arrest warrants"" against the two. Ms Machado thanked the Costa Rican government but said that it was her ""responsibility to continue this struggle alongside the people"". In a separate social media post late on Wednesday, Ms Machado urged her supporters to ""mobilise"". She wrote on X: ""It's time to trust in each other. To stay active and firm. ""It took time to win; now it's time to collect."" Videos show opposition protesters in multiple locations taking to the streets. Security forces fired tear gas and rubber bullets against people as thousands gathered in Caracas. Maduro's supporters are jubilant but the opposition is demanding proof of the voting numbers. Election officials say the president has an unassailable lead but the opposition vows to contest the result. Both Maduro and González, the opposition candidate, have claimed victory in this presidential election. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

2,2024-08-01 15:13:49.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 13:13:40.000,Witness to Titan sub tragedy tells of fear and false hope,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw8y28zvvvwo,2024-07-31 23:41:35.000,"A witness to the Titan submersible disaster has told BBC News about the fear and false hope felt by those on its support ship. Rory Golden was on the Oceangate expedition when contact with the sub and its five passengers was lost on a dive to the Titanic in June 2023. “We had this image in our heads of them being down there, running out of oxygen in the freezing cold, getting terribly frightened and scared,” he said. But after learning the sub had imploded just hours into the dive, he said it was a comfort to know those onboard hadn’t suffered. Mr Golden was on the Polar Prince support ship to give presentations about the Titanic when the submersible went missing. “When the sub was overdue we weren't unduly concerned because communications break down a lot in the ocean,” he explained. “But when the alarm was finally raised, that's when we realised that there were some serious issues.” A major search and rescue operation was launched by the US Coast Guard. A few days in, sounds of banging were detected underwater raising hope that these were coming from the missing sub. But it's now known that those onboard most likely died instantly after Titan suffered a catastrophic failure as it neared the Titanic at the bottom of the Atlantic. “We lived in false hope for four days,” Mr Golden said. “There’s still a lot of questions to be answered.” Those who perished were British explorer Hamish Harding, the British-Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman, Stockton Rush, the CEO of Oceangate, and French diver Paul Henri - or PH - Nargeolet. Rory Golden was a close friend of PH - a veteran deep sea explorer. He is now on the first expedition to the Titanic since the tragedy - an expedition that PH Nargeolet was supposed to be leading. A plaque is being laid in his honour at the wreck site and a memorial service for all those who died on the sub has been held at sea. Mr Golden told the BBC he was one of the last people to see PH alive. “He left the ship in great spirits, in great form and he was happy. He was going somewhere that he wanted to be.” Rory Golden had also visited the Titanic on the Oceangate sub. ”PH and I had discussed the submersible in the past and I had actually made a dive in it myself the year before,” he said. “And I'm here - as are many others. The Titan sub had made 15 dives to the Titanic up to that point, so it had worked. “I was comfortable, I spent 12 hours at the Titanic and it was a whole different experience being in a submersible that I could actually move around quite well in.” He told the BBC that he didn’t regret his dive at all. “It wasn't my time,” he said. “You never know when your time is going to come. And that certainly brought that home to all of us.” The discovery of the wreckage of Titan four days after it went missing confirmed the fate of those onboard. “We all cried when the remains were found of the sub,” he said. “A special bond has been formed between all of us who were there on the ship that week. And that's a bond that will always be there.” Industry experts had raised many serious questions about the safety of the Titan submersible prior to the dive. Investigations by the US Coast Guard and Canadian Coast Guard are still ongoing. They are likely to call for changes to ensure such a tragedy doesn’t happen again. A new expedition aims to document the world's most famous shipwreck in unprecedented detail. Graham Padden from Southport had a place booked but was unable to raise the money needed in time. The private submersible industry was shaken after the implosion of the OceanGate Titan sub last year. . Mary Roberts survived both the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 and the Rohilla in 1914.

2,2024-08-01 15:13:49.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 13:13:40.000,'Slave auction' pupils to face disciplinary in South Africa,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0ve3r5ydjvo,2024-07-31 18:34:18.000,"Four schoolchildren in South Africa are to face a disciplinary hearing over a viral video in which black students are seen being auctioned off as slaves, the authorities in Cape Town have told the BBC. The footage, showing pupils in a cage while other students bid for them, caused outrage when it was shared on social media last Friday. It was filmed at Pinelands High School and involved students in grade eight, which is the first year of secondary school when pupils are aged around 14. The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) has said it has opened its own investigation into the incident. It comes as two other schools in the country - where white-minority rule ended three decades ago with the election of anti-apartheid fighter Nelson Mandela as president - are dealing with alleged racist incidents. “It is disturbing that these incidences continue to occur 30 years into democracy,” the SAHRC said, adding it was even more distressing that they had occurred in schools. The four Pinelands High School students believed to be behind the mock auction are currently suspended. “The investigation is ongoing and nearing completion with 24 learners having been interviewed in the first two [school days] since the allegations were made,” Bronagh Hammond, spokesperson for the Western Cape Education Department, said on Wednesday in a statement sent to the BBC. “Steps will also be taken against other learners who may have transgressed certain provisions within the code of conduct,” she added. The incident first came to light after one of the pupils showed the footage to his mother, Merle Potgieter, who then told the school's management and local media. She says her son, who is 14, fought off boys who were attempting to force him into the caged enclosure alongside other black boys who were already inside it. According to Ms Potgieter the alleged perpetrators were coloured - which is a South African term meaning mixed-race. In the footage of the mock auction, children can be heard calling out various bids of up to 100,000 rand ($5,400; £4,200). ""Going once... going twice... sold!"" one boy can be heard shouting. Counselling support had been prioritised for those affected - and all grade eight pupils had had debriefing sessions, Ms Hammond said. Slavery in Cape Town dates back to the 1650s when the Dutch colonised the peninsula and thousands of enslaved people were brought to the region from south-east Asia, Madagascar and Mozambique. Today Cape Town is considered one of the most racially segregated and unequal cities in South Africa, despite its multi-ethnic mix. This is due to the legacy of apartheid, when the white regime in the 1950s pushed black and mixed-raced communities into segregated townships outside the city. The apartheid government also entrenched a racial hierarchy, which put black people right at the bottom. On Tuesday, MP Makhi Feni, chair of the parliamentary committee on education, urged the schools at the heart of the latest scandals to “consider meaningful programmes that will foster social cohesion and South African-ness”. “The question we all ought to ask genuinely is what emboldens a person, hardly a teenager, with no knowledge of where we come from as a country, to act in a manner that points to racism. Surely, our children are not and should not be racist,” he said. Meanwhile, the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party is demanding that the pupils be suspended for at least two years and perform ""community service in black areas"". It has threatened to call protests and shut down the school if it finds the authorities' ultimate handling of the incident less than satisfactory.

Nearly 200 people are still missing after Mundakkai and Chooralmala areas in Wayanad district were flattened by thick torrents of mud and water on Tuesday. Rescue operations have been hampered by heavy rains in the region all week. The army is constructing a temporary bridge to Mundakkai, which is across a swollen river, to help stranded residents and search for more survivors. Health officials reported 256 autopsies, but that included a number of body parts. On Thursday, Wayanad remained on high alert for more rains as schools and colleges were closed for the day. The hilly district is known for its cardamom plantations and tea estates and has several popular tourist spots. Officials said nearly 1,600 people had been rescued from the affected villages and tea estates. But migrant workers from the estates were among those still missing. More than 8,000 people have been moved to 82 relief camps set up in the district, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said. The army is now building a temporary metal bridge to Mundakkai village, which is among the worst affected by the landslides. Earlier, rescuers had constructed a temporary pedestrian bridge and used ropes to rappel across the river to reach stranded people there and move the injured to hospitals. But heavy rains and strong river current had made it difficult to carry out full-fledged rescue work. The temporary metal bridge is expected to be complete by Thursday evening. It will allow ambulances and heavy machinery to move rubble and search for survivors, Major General Vinod Mathew told reporters. Meanwhile, the air force is conducting sorties to identify areas with survivors and distribute relief material. Three army sniffer dogs were expected to reach the disaster zone to help detect people still trapped under the rubble. ""Still large areas are to be explored and searched to find out whether live people are there or not,"" senior police officer MR Ajith Kumar told AFP news agency on Wednesday. TV footage showed harrowing scenes at relief camps and hospitals as survivors searched for their loved ones or waited for news of them. One man listed out names of those who had still not been found as he told Manorama News, ""My house was spared but I have lost many children who were like my own."" At a community centre that had bodies displayed for identification, a young man told The NewsMinute that he had identified two of his uncles, but was still searching for seven other relatives. ""I am in touch with people at other centres where bodies are placed and they are sending me pictures, but I am yet to identify any of my other missing relatives,"" he told the news site. With more heavy rainfall forecast for the district, the government has warned residents to be prepared for flash floods. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

From 15 August onwards, the carrier will stop serving the noodles to economy class passengers. It said the increased risk of turbulence, narrow aisles and passengers sitting closely together could mean ""burn incidents occur frequently"". Business and first class fliers, however, will continue to enjoy the treat. The snack has long been a passenger favourite and something the carrier is widely known for. Many praise the fact that it is available for free on request. In a statement, the carrier said that since 2019 the number of times turbulence had occurred on its flights had doubled. It added that in economy class, several cups of noodles are all served at once, saying that the ""risk of burns is greater with passengers crowded together"". But in business and first class the snacks are brought individually to these passengers, reducing the likelihood of spillage in the event of turbulence, the carrier said. Up until now, the Korean carrier had been providing the noodles for free to passengers on longer routes. But this will now be replaced with sandwiches, corn dogs, pizza and ""Hot Pockets"" - crusty turnovers filled with cheese, meat and vegetables. The move sparked discussion on social media. Some users expressed relief, while others pointed out that the carrier was still serving other items that could cause burns. ""Aren't coffee and tea hot?"" said one comment. However, another called it a ""very good decision"", saying they had always been ""nervous"" that they would be scalded. One user said they had hoped the instant noodles would be removed ""because of the smell"". Korean Air said it will ""continue to seek service methods that are safe while increasing customer convenience and satisfaction"". Earlier this year, Singapore Airlines said it would stop serving hot drinks and meals during turbulence as part of a ""more cautious approach"". A 73-year-old British passenger died and dozens more were injured when flight SQ 321 encountered turbulence over Myanmar and was diverted to Thailand in May. Turbulence is one of the most unpredictable of all weather phenomena, with severe turbulence becoming more likely with climate change, recent research shows. It is thought the technology will enable quicker and cleaner journeys across short distances. Some Rex Airlines flights have since been cancelled, with a number of its planes grounded The airline blamed difficulties securing more efficient aircraft and sustainable jet fuel. Thousands more passengers could face delays or cancellations after an arson attack on France's train network on Friday. South Korea said it would request a meeting with International Olympic Committee Chairman Thomas Bach. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

2,2024-08-01 15:13:49.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 13:13:40.000,Uber strikes EV deal with Chinese Tesla rival BYD,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cley0xn8e88o,2024-08-01 04:30:56.000,"Uber has announced a deal which aims to bring 100,000 electric vehicles (EVs) made by China's BYD to the ride-hailing giant's global fleet of cars. The two companies say they will offer Uber drivers incentives to switch to electric cars, including discounts on maintenance, charging, financing and leasing. The multi-year agreement will be rolled out first in Europe and Latin America, before being made available in the Middle East, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The announcement comes as EV sales around the world have slowed and Chinese car makers face higher import charges in places like the US and the European Union. ""The companies aim to bring down the total cost of EV ownership for Uber drivers, accelerating the uptake of EVs on the Uber platform globally, and introducing millions of riders to greener rides,"" the two firms said in a statement. They also said they will work to integrate BYD's self-driving technologies into Uber's platform. Earlier this year, Uber said it was working with Tesla to promote EV adoption among its drivers in the US and planned to develop a purpose-built EV with South Korean car giant Kia. The US, the European Union and other major markets have recently announced tariff hikes on China-made EVs in moves aimed at protecting their car industries. The move has prompted BYD and other Chinese EV makers to expand their production facilities outside China. In July, BYD agreed a $1bn (£780m) deal to set up a manufacturing plant in Turkey. The new plant will be able to produce up to 150,000 vehicles a year, according to Turkish state news agency Anadolu. The facility is expected to create around 5,000 jobs and start production by the end of 2026. Also last month, BYD opened an EV plant in Thailand - its first factory in South East Asia. BYD said the plant will have an annual capacity of 150,000 vehicles and is projected to generate 10,000 jobs. At the end of last year, BYD announced it would build a manufacturing plant in EU member state Hungary. It will be the firm's first passenger car factory in Europe and is expected to create thousands of jobs. The company has also said it is planning to build a manufacturing plant in Mexico. BYD, which is backed by veteran US investor Warren Buffett, is the world’s second-largest EV company after Elon Musk's Tesla. MADE NE aims to create a new generation of workers in the electric vehicle and battery sectors. More than 1.8 million cars are due to get a software fix, US safety regulators said. Pilling work is to start imminently at the multi-billion-pound car battery factory near Bridgwater. The aim to train a skilled workforce for sectors including electric vehicle and battery production.

2,2024-08-01 15:13:49.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 13:13:40.000,Italy opens controversial migrant centre in Albania,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lke090kgko,2024-08-01 07:20:23.000,"Italy, which receives the most migrant arrivals in the European Union, is partially outsourcing the challenge from today, as it opens the first of two planned camps in neighbouring Albania. The centres will be used to house up to 3000 migrants per month rescued en route to Italy as part of Europe’s first ""offshoring"" scheme, while the continent grapples with how to respond to the challenge of irregular migration. The camp that opens today is located in the northern Albanian port of Shengjin. The opening of a second centre, on a former air force base in nearby Gjader, has been delayed. The structures will be entirely managed by the Italian government, which paid for their construction. They will be used for migrants picked up in international waters – though not women, children, or those deemed vulnerable. Once there, they will be allowed to request asylum in Italy. If refused, they will be sent back to countries deemed safe to return. “Italian and European legislation will be applied in these centres,"" Fabrizio Bucci, Italy’s ambassador in Albania, told me. “It’s like having a centre in Italy – but in Albania.” The agreement signed by the Italian and Albanian Prime Ministers will remain in place for five years – with the option to extend if it proves successful in reducing the migrant burden on Italy and deterring some from attempting to come. Arrivals in Italy by sea this year – around 31,000 so far – are down by more than half from the same period in 2023. Giorgia Meloni, the Italian Prime Minister, ran for office promising to clamp down hard on migration – and the Albania plan has become a key tenet of that. The hefty price tag, estimated at upwards of €650m (£547), is one of the criticisms levelled by Italian opposition politicians and human rights groups. “It’s an excessive cost to detain a limited number of migrants”, said Riccardo Magi, an MP with the left-wing +Europa party. When Ms Meloni recently visited the site in Albania, he approached her car to protest – and was grabbed by Albanian security officials. As she intervened, telling them to ease off, he shouted: “If they treat an elected MP like this, imagine how they’ll treat the migrants”. Speaking to the BBC, he compared the structures to a penal colony. He also doubted the ability of night-time rescuers to properly screen those picked up to ensure that no vulnerable individuals are sent to Albania. ""They won’t be able to delve deep into whether somebody has suffered torture or sexual violence or discrimination due to their sexuality back in Africa”, Mr Magi said. “It’s all an attempt at dissuasion and a PR show to tell Italians this is the first time a government can keep migrants out. But nobody who has risked their life to cross to Italy will be discouraged.” Fabrizio Bucci, the Italian ambassador in Tirana, disagrees. “It’s one of the elements that migrants and smugglers will have to factor in,"" he said. “What do we have to lose? We’ve been trying to redistribute migrants throughout the EU and it hasn’t worked. So why not try to chart a new way?” He refers to it as an experiment that, if successful, could be replicated. Indeed, 15 EU members, led by Denmark, recently wrote an open letter to the European Commission backing the outsourcing of migration. Sir Keir Starmer praised the Italy-Albania deal after meeting both Prime Ministers. It has drawn comparison with the plan of the previous Conservative government to deport failed asylum seekers from the United Kingdom to Rwanda – ditched by Mr Starmer. But the agreements are significantly different. While Rwanda would have managed the asylum requests and centres under its deal, giving successful claimants asylum there and deporting failed ones to third countries deemed safe by the Rwandan government, the Albania deal will be under Italian jurisdiction. “We made sure the Albanian legislation was already in full compliance with EU and international laws”, said Ambassador Bucci. For Albania, the reward is a boost to its image as it negotiates European Union membership. But Vladimir Karaj, a Tirana-based journalist with the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network, said it was a “complete surprise” when it was announced by the Prime Minister Edi Rama. Before the Rwanda deal was struck, there were reports that Britain was aiming for an agreement with Albania, which Mr Rama forcefully shot down. “He claimed he was strictly against this kind of treatment for refugees”, he said. “So when Albania struck the deal with Italy, there was huge speculation over what Rama was gaining personally."" Mr Karaj says there’s no ""smoking gun"": ""The government’s narrative is that Italy is our best friend and took in Albanians when our dictatorship fell in the 1990s.” The deal, Mr Karaj said, has been met only with short-lived protests by some claiming it was aimed at replacing Albanians with foreigners, or giving away territory to Italy. He suspects other countries may now come knocking on Albania’s door. “Albania needs the support it can get from the west”, he said. “If western governments like the UK or Germany see this is a solution, I don’t think Rama’s words about it just being for Italy will be that easy to sell.” The NCA says the boat continued its journey to the UK and arrived in Dover carrying about 40 people. Ms Meloni last year removed Italy from President Xi Jinping's signature Belt and Road Initiative. Michael Frison, from Chard, went missing in Sardinia on 13 July. The World Champion blamed ""losing too many kilos"" and ""irrepressible enthusiasm"" for the mishap. The bill will allow troops to open fire on migrants crossing the border when soldiers feel under threat. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

2,2024-08-01 15:13:49.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 13:13:40.000,"Sex, money, social media - how VP contenders are vetted",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv30gx7xkko,2024-07-31 15:09:34.000,"As Democratic presidential hopeful Kamala Harris vets potential running mates, spare a thought for the contenders as they undergo a process that one past participant likens to ""a colonoscopy performed with a telescope”. Have you ever paid for sex? Have you ever paid for an abortion? Have you ever had a homosexual encounter? This is just some of the material in questionnaires fired off during the exhaustive vetting process for previous US vice-presidential nominees. Potential partners to join Ms Harris on the Democratic ticket for November's election will have to answer up to 200 questions before they can even begin to be seriously considered. The vetters - campaign officials and lawyers who volunteer their billable hours for the networking and prestige - often have about a month to dig up every grain of dirt they can find. The Harris campaign has a matter of days to pick a running mate, with a paperwork deadline looming. The vice-president, who went through the process herself only four years ago, has been assessing around a dozen contenders, with Governor Josh Shapiro and Senator Mark Kelly among those being touted. Pete Buttigieg, who is also among the rumoured potential picks, was asked this week if the possible running mates are aware they are being vetted. ""Yeah, you know,"" he said with a smile. What makes the whole undertaking especially challenging is that, unlike with cabinet picks, the FBI does not perform background checks on vice-presidents. The vetters will pore over a contender’s tax returns and medical history. They may log on to his or her private social media accounts. They will scour the social media posts of his or her children. The grandchildren’s, too. The least suggestion of marital infidelity, or any other skeleton in the closet, will be picked apart. They will check every record of every word the potential candidate has ever uttered or written. Jim Hamilton, a Democratic lawyer who evaluated potential running mates for John Kerry, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, told the BBC that notes of the process are destroyed afterwards to preserve “a strict, strict veil of confidentiality”. He oversaw more than 200 lawyers who were tasked with finding Mrs Clinton’s running mate (she picked Virginia Senator Tim Kaine). “Everybody's got something in their background they’d just sooner not talk about,” Mr Hamilton said. “But you'd be surprised, once people commit to the process, at how candid they are in their answers.” Evan Bayh, a finalist to become Barack Obama’s running mate in 2008, remembers the procedure took nearly three months and was “like having a colonoscopy performed with a telescope”. “There was a whole team assigned to me: an accountant, a lawyer, a physician, you know,” the former Indiana senator and governor told the BBC. “They talked to my wife, they talked to my father.” Television crews were soon camped outside his house in Washington DC. Mr Bayh recalls his shock one morning as he sat down to breakfast with the television on and heard an MSNBC host remark that the senator’s bowl of yoghurt and granola “sure looks tasty”. The head of the vetting team phoned one day to ask Mr Bayh about a false internet rumour that he had once received psychiatric treatment. “And I said, ‘No, it's not true. But if you guys don't hurry up and make a decision, it might be true,’” he remembers joking. A list of 20 names was whittled away. Mr Bayh says it ultimately came down to himself and Joe Biden, then a Delaware senator. He recalls how he was flown out “very clandestinely” to St Louis, Missouri, in August that year to meet the future president in his hotel room. They spoke for around three hours. “There was about a three-foot high stack of materials there,” he recalls, ""that he [Mr Obama] just gestured to it, and he said, ‘I've gone over all the reports on you, and nothing in there bothers me.’ “He said, ‘But if there's anything that our team didn't discover, you should tell me now because it will come out.’ “And I said, ‘Well, your people did do a very thorough job. But there were probably two or three things I should mention to you.’ And I did. “And he looked at me, he said, ‘That's it?' And I said, 'Yeah, that's it.’ And he said, ‘Well, you haven't led very much of a life, have you?’” Mr Bayh did not elaborate to the BBC on his disclosures to Mr Obama in the hotel room, except to say they were family matters. Mr Biden was ultimately successful. Campaign manager David Plouffe later quoted President Obama as saying it was a “coin toss” between the two. Sometimes a vetter can pose a question that no-one else thought of, revealing a potential red flag, even if it’s not disqualifying. Gary Ginsberg, who worked for the Clinton campaign in ’92, told the BBC he remembers Al Gore at a loss for words when asked during the process if he had any friends. The reserved Tennessee senator bristled. But when pressed, he could name none, beyond his brother-in-law and two congressmen. Mr Gore’s lack of a social circle bothered one top campaign official. From a long-list of 50, he was nevertheless picked to be running mate. They won. Mr Gore, however, would struggle to overcome low personal likability ratings. The vetting process used to be largely informal and much less invasive, since it was seen as rude to ask a senator or governor about personal matters. Two selection disasters changed all that forever. In 1972, the Democratic White House nominee George McGovern dumped his running mate after just 18 days. He had picked Missouri Senator Thomas Eagleton based on a two-minute phone conversation and no background check. It almost immediately emerged in media reports that Mr Eagleton had received electroshock treatment in hospital for clinical depression a decade earlier. Nixon aides began asking reporters: “How could McGovern be trusted after putting a crazy man on the ticket?” In that November’s election, the Republican president annihilated his Democratic challenger. Vetters soon began to cast their nets wider, to look more closely at a potential running mate’s family members, after another embarrassment upended the 1984 White House race. Democratic nominee Walter Mondale needed a game-changer against Ronald Reagan that year, so he picked Geraldine Ferraro, the first female running mate ever on a major party national ticket. But the campaign was hamstrung by revelations about her real estate developer husband’s financial dealings. President Reagan went on to win 49 states in a landslide re-election. Sometimes a potential running mate dazzles at the audition, but fizzles on the political stage. In 2008, Republican presidential nominee John McCain’s campaign had just 72 hours to vet Sarah Palin. The then-44-year-old Alaska governor was asked by aides how she would react in a national security crisis where the president had been temporarily incapacitated by surgery. Under this scenario, the director of national intelligence comes to Acting-President Palin and tells her they have pinpointed Osama Bin Laden. A plane is overhead ready to kill the al-Qaeda leader. But there’ll be multiple civilian casualties. “Do you take the shot?” the vetter asked her. “Yes,” she said, “I would take the shot because I’m the President of the United States, this is our archenemy who took the lives of 3,000-plus Americans. And then I would get down on my knees and ask for forgiveness for the innocent souls whose lives I would be taking.” The vetters were highly impressed with this answer. Yet after she was unveiled as the vice-presidential nominee, Ms Palin proved unable to answer a reporter’s basic question about what newspapers she read. Soon she was seen as gaffe-prone and unready for the political primetime. Even when the vetting process is conducted with more rigour, the final decision is always up to the nominee. George HW Bush - one of the 15 US vice-presidents who became president- went with his gut when he picked little-known Indiana Senator Dan Quayle to be his running mate in 1988. Though they won, Mr Quayle, 41, was widely seen as more of a liability than an asset to the ticket, as recounted in the book First in Line, by Kate Andersen Brower. The vice-presidential nominee was asked by a reporter aboard the campaign plane in 1988: “What’s the favourite book that you’ve read?” Mr Quayle turned to his wife, Marilyn. “What’s the favourite book I’ve read?” he asked her, leaving a nearby political aide aghast. The exchange of 24 prisoners between Russia and the West will be the largest since the Cold War. How the devastating 2001 plane attacks on America unfolded and how they shaped our age.

2,2024-08-01 15:13:49.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 13:13:40.000,Kenya rolls out poison in bid to cull a million crows,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c999n2nyvwlo,2024-08-01 06:43:48.000,"""Invasive alien birds"" sounds like the strapline to a scary Hollywood blockbuster but for the people of coastal Kenya it is not a matter of fiction. The authorities there are so worried about the nuisance created by Indian house crows that they have begun the process of culling a million of them. They have not targeted humans, as in the Alfred Hitchock horror film The Birds, but these ones have for decades caused widespread disruption, by preying on wildlife, raiding tourist areas and attacking poultry farms. Poison is now being used in the towns of Watamu and Malindi to kill the first tranche of the ruthless sub-species. This ambitious poisoning campaign is aimed at halting the crows’ advance towards the capital, Nairobi. The birds, known on the coast as ""kunguru"" or ""kurabu"", originated from India and other parts of Asia, often spreading elsewhere by travelling on trading ships. But they are believed to have been intentionally introduced in East Africa around 1890s in a bid to tackle a mounting waste problem on the Zanzibar archipelago, then a British protectorate. From there, they spread to the mainland and up the coast to Kenya. They were first recorded in the port of Mombasa in 1947 and since then, their numbers have exploded, thanks to the growing human population and the accompanying mounds of rubbish, which provide an ideal environment for the birds to feed and breed. They also have no natural predators. The Indian house crows, considered one of the world’s most invasive and destructive birds, have continued their northward journey. ""They prey on the indigenous species, not just birds but also mammals, reptiles - and so their impact on biodiversity is devastating,"" Jaap Gijsbertsen, a Dutch bird expert, who is visiting Kenya's Watamu area, told the BBC. Conservationists say that the crows have significantly reduced the number of small indigenous birds in the region, such as weavers and waxbills, by ripping their nests apart while targeting eggs and even chicks. ""When the population of local birds declines, the environment begins to suffer. There will be a possible increase of harmful pests and insects that the birds prey on,"" Lennox Kirao, a research scientist with conservation group A Rocha Kenya, said. They also damage crops, livestock and chickens. ""They pounce on chicks and eat them like madmen. These are not normal birds, they act wildly,"" said Eunice Katana, a resident of Takaye village in Kilifi county. They are also known to use a unique sound to communicate distress - or when they spot a prey, according to Mr Kirao. The birds have defaced houses in Mombasa by defecating on the walls and roofs, while many people shy away from sitting under tree shades for fear of being dirtied by their droppings. ""These crows rise early and interrupt our sleep with their annoying squeals and cawing,"" Mombasa resident Victor Kimuli told the BBC. Given all these issues the authorities felt they had to act and aim to halve the Indian house crow population through poisoning, which began on Tuesday. This follows months of consultations with environmental experts, conservationists, community leaders and representatives from the hotel industry, the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) said. ""We are trying to get their population down to a controllable number,"" said Mr Kirao. The culling process involves months of pre-baiting - where the birds are encouraged, through leaving meat out, to gather at various places near their roost sites. ""We then poison them after pulling together the highest number in the baiting sites,"" Eric Kinoti, an official from the A Rocha Kenya, said. An avian poison called Starlicide is so far the only known substance that has proved effective in reducing crow numbers, without affecting other birds or animals. Close to 2,000 crows were killed in 2022 during efficacy tests carried out on the poison by Little Kenya Gardens, the company licensed to import the poison, Cecilia Ruto, owner of the firm, said. ""The slow-acting poison is entirely metabolised by the crow before it dies – which means, there is little risk of secondary poisoning to any other species that feeds on the dead crow,"" Ms Ruto added. There are currently 2kg (4.4lb) of the poison in the country which is estimated to be able to kill about 20,000 crows in the ongoing eradication. But there are plans to import more from New Zealand. Its use in Kenya has, however, raised ethical concerns from animal and bird rights activists, who argue that poisoning the crows is inhumane and that alternative and non-lethal methods should be explored. “Mass poisoning is a short-term solution that does not address the root cause of the problem,” said Leonard Onyango, an environmentalist. “There is a need to look at sustainable, humane approaches to manage the crow population,” he added. But those involved in the programme emphasise the need to protect native species and ensure ecological balance. “If we do nothing now, the damage could become irreversible,” said Mr Kirao, who is involved in the culling programme. This is not the first time the government has initiated plans to control invasive bird species. The previous attempt more than 20 years ago reduced the bird population, but the government later banned the importation of Starlicide in an effort to regulate what was coming into the country. Apart from dump sites, tourist hotels have become the crows’ favourite haunt, where they flock dining areas, disrupting guests as they enjoy their meals, hotel owners have complained. “The crows have really become a big bother to guests who visit our hotels to enjoy their meals outside the tropical beaches,"" Maureen Awuor, the Kenya Association of Hotelkeepers and Caterers chairperson, said. Some hotels trap and suffocate the crows, while others have hired staff with catapults to scare them. But trapping is said to be ineffective as the birds are intelligent enough to avoid areas where they witness other crows dying or being trapped. Despite the huge numbers which are planned to be culled, the authorities feel that they have no choice, especially now that there are concerns that the crows could spread inland. The birds have been spotted in the Mtito Andei area - about 240km (150 miles) from the capital, Nairobi, conservationists say. ""My biggest fear is, if we don't do anything now, the crows will reach Nairobi. This will pose a great threat to birdlife in the country, especially at the Nairobi National Park,"" Mr Kirao said.

2,2024-08-01 15:13:49.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 13:13:40.000,"50 jobs, 30 years: The unseen labour of an Indian female worker",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ck7g9kjdrpmo,2024-07-31 23:55:23.000,"Syeda X, a poor migrant woman living in shanty towns that skirt India’s capital Delhi, struggled through more than 50 jobs in 30 years. She trimmed jeans threads, cooked savouries, shelled almonds and made tea strainers, door knobs, photo frames and toy guns. She also stitched school bags and did bead and jewellery work. Despite her hard work, she earned meagre wages, like 25 rupees (30 cents; 23 pence) for assembling 1,000 toy guns. The protagonist of a new book, The Many Lives of Syeda X, by journalist Neha Dixit, Syeda relocated to Delhi with her family in the mid-1990s after religious riots in the neighbouring state of Uttar Pradesh. Reported over 10 years with more than 900 interviews, the book highlights, in part, the precarious life of an Indian home-based female worker. Ms Dixit’s book shines a spotlight on the invisible lives of India’s neglected female home-based workers. After being recognised officially as a distinct category of workers only in 2007, India defined a home-based worker as someone who produces goods or services for an employer from their own home or chosen premises, regardless of whether the employer provides equipment or materials. Over 80% of working women in India are employed in the informal economy, with home-based work being the largest sector after agriculture. Yet, no legislation or policy supports these women. Wiego, an organisation that supports women in informal employment, estimated that by 2017-18, women comprised about 17 million of the 41 million home-based workers in India. These women represented approximately 9% of total employment. Their numbers in the city have grown faster than in India’s countryside. “The centre of gravity in home-based workers appears to be shifting to urban areas,” says Indrani Mazumdar, a historian who has worked extensively on the subject. Bereft of social security or any protection, these women are in a constant battle with poverty, precariousness and wayward spouses. Often their family’s main breadwinners, they strive to earn enough to educate their children out of poverty. These women also face the brunt of climate change, losing livelihoods and running losses: monsoon waterlogging in their homes leads to wastage of their supplied material. In India, around 75% of female workers in manufacturing work are home-based, says economist Sona Mitra. “These women are recorded as self-employed and they are largely invisible,” she adds. Ms Dixit’s harrowing narrative portrays Syeda X and other home-based working women as archetypes of helplessness and exploitation. No-one knows who sets the abysmal rates for their work. No-one provides instructions, training, or tools. These women rely solely on each other to learn how to get the job done. Finding work is also often about following the news cycle, Ms Dixit writes. When Kalpana Chawla became the first Indian-origin woman in space in 1997, women dressed plastic dolls in hand-stitched white spacesuits. During the 1999 cricket World Cup, they stitched hundreds of cheap footballs. A viral 2001 rumour about a “monkey man” attacking people in Delhi spurred a demand for masks resembling the creature to be sold at traffic crossings. During elections, they made flags, key rings and caps for political parties. When schools resumed, they packed crayons and school bags and bound books. Many women also find it difficult to get home-based work for more than 20 days a month. Ms Dixit writes that only those who don't negotiate rates or ask too many questions, buy their own tools, deliver on time, never ask for advances or help during crises and tolerate delayed payments are able to find work easily. The precarity of female home workers has increased due to changes in the nature of the work, according to Ms Mazumdar. Up until the 1990s, the readymade garment industry outsourced many tasks to home workers. This shifted in the 1990s as factories began bringing tasks in-house and machines replaced human labour, particularly for embroidery. ""Home-based work became very volatile,"" she says. In 2019, the International Labour Organisation, drawing on household surveys in 118 countries, estimated there were around 260 million home-based workers worldwide, representing 7.9% of the global employment. Research from Brazil and South Africa shows that monitoring work conditions and protecting workers' rights in subcontracted or home-based work is possible when local governments and trade unions collaborate effectively. Such examples in India are few and far between. There's the 52-year-old Self Employed Women’s Association (Sewa), a membership-based organisation that unites poor, self-employed women in the informal economy. There are self-help groups of home-based workers and micro-finance to support them. ""But these schemes have really not helped them when it comes to employment,"" says Ms Mazumdar. In 2009, women in Delhi who shelled and cleaned almonds from homes stopped working, demanding better pay and overtime, among other things. (They were paid 50 rupees for cleaning a 23kg bag for 12-16 hours.) The strike paralysed the almond processing industry at its peak season. A study in Tamil Nadu state by social scientist K Kalpana illustrated how home and neighbourhood-based female workers subcontracted to make appalams (papadum) in Chennai successfully defended their rights, despite government agencies ignoring claims of trade unions. Syeda X and her friends had no such luck. “If she ever took time off to nurse an illness or to attend to her children, her job would be lost to another faceless migrant, fighting to take her place,” writes Ms Dixit. Displacement and hardship were the only constants in her life, shifting from job to job and home to home. Follow BBC India on YouTube, Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

2,2024-08-01 15:13:49.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 13:13:40.000,Video games strike rumbles on in row over AI,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czvxz11gl57o,2024-07-31 23:46:32.000,"Actors from the world of gaming went on strike last week, in a row about the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and the threat it poses to their livelihoods. It has reignited the debate about how the entertainment industry is adapting to new technology. When actor Jennifer Hale talks, you listen. Her delivery is measured and surgically precise, yet her tone has a warmth that most ASMR creators would envy. She could read the phone book and you’d pay attention. It’s unsurprising, then, that her voice is her livelihood, and that she takes the threat to her industry posed by AI so seriously. “They see that the work of our souls is nothing more than a commodity to generate profits for them,"" she says of several of the major gaming companies. ""They don't see that they're crushing human beings beneath their feet in blind pursuit of money and profit, it's disgusting."" From Commander Shepard in the Mass Effect series to Samus Aran in the Metroid titles, Hale’s list of gaming credits is as long as your arm and her voice is familiar to millions. Hale is one of the most high-profile voice actors in the world. She’s joined 2,500 members of the US actors union SAG-AFTRA who perform in games, by striking until games divisions of prominent companies like Activision, Warner Brothers, Walt Disney and EA agree to protections around the use of artificial intelligence (AI). She tells BBC News: “They could, for example, take all my performances in a game, let's say Mass Effect, feed them into a machine, not too long down the timeline, spit out an entirely new Mass Effect, with a performance that was entirely generated by AI.” Concerns about AI were one of the key issues in last year’s 118-day actors strike organised by SAG-AFTRA. Terms were eventually agreed with Hollywood studios for film and TV actors. But the dispute around videogames has rumbled on, finally boiling over into a strike on 25 July. While both sides have agreed on a host of issues, AI protections remains a sticking point. Hale may be one of the most successful voice actors in the business but in contrast to those who work in front of the camera and despite the games industry generating revenue estimated to be around $189bn (£147bn) in 2024, voice acting in games is considerably less well paid than film and TV work. “I’m a single working mother who has bills to pay and a life to provide for my kid, as voice actors we don't get paid star salaries. Under what they're proposing on the other side of this contract, they would pay me nothing.” Audrey Cooling, a representative of the 10 game companies negotiating with the union, told BBC News: ""Our offer is directly responsive to SAG-AFTRA’s concerns and extends meaningful AI protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers working under the IMA [Interactive Media Agreement]."" This is an ongoing deal to cover artists working in video games. Hale argues not all games companies are the problem, some businesses can and are making deals which work for all sides. “Anybody sitting in their basement, anywhere making a game can go to SAG and say, hey, my budget is small, I only have this much money. I really want to work with these good actors. What can I do in SAG will say, absolutely, here you go, how big are you? Great here's your structure."" She adds this strike might be a symptom of a growing unease in the wider workplace with AI. “We actors are the canary in the coal mine. You can see them coming for us, but if they dismiss it, if it gets swept under the rug because we're just performers, what does that mean?” On the other side of the Atlantic, John Barclay, assistant general secretary of the UK actor’s union Equity, released a statement of solidarity with its stateside counterparts. “We stand shoulder to shoulder with SAG-AFTRA as partners in a global fight to secure fair pay and protect our members’ rights, which could not be more urgent as we move forward with artificial intelligence innovation.” Regulations around strikes are different in the UK, Equity members aren’t striking and neither will UK members of SAG-AFTRA be compelled to. Actor David Menkin has provided the voice for Luke Skywalker in Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, as well as voice work in Final Fantasy XVI and Horizon Zero Dawn, amongst a host of other games. He explains: “Here in the UK, we don't have a mutually agreed contract between the union Equity and the producers that make these games. So therefore, even if you're SAG-AFTRA but you were hired on a UK based contract, you can't stop, you cannot strike, you cannot leave the production, you have to fulfil everything in your contract.” He tells me he’ s concerned that US companies may try and work around the issue of striking American actors by coming to the UK and hiring British talent to perform in games instead. “All we can do is make sure that if the work is dumped in the UK, that we are making sure that UK-based actors are fully informed.” In the US the strike continues and while she waits for both sides to return to the negotiating table, Jennifer Hale hopes long time creative concerns will overcome short-term commercial gain. “I hope they see that we are all in this together. I don't understand why they're willing to kill us all off to increase things a few percentage points, it makes no sense to me."" Vets say artificial intelligence is saving lives, but the RCVS says it must be used responsibly. The programme aims to support people and firms in using the technology, Digital Isle of Man says. The increased use of AI may prevent tickets being resold at excessively high prices. Ask Tom will be able to listen to and answer customers who call the council with queries. The Bletchley Park installation will see an AI character give tailored responses is a ""world first"". Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

2,2024-08-01 15:13:49.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 13:13:40.000,How a refugee Olympian found a new life in Canada,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crg4vr7kyq5o,2024-07-31 23:07:53.000,"Nigara Shaheen’s journey to becoming an Olympic judoka did not begin with judo. Instead, it began with a 30-minute karate lesson on her family’s balcony in Peshawar, Pakistan. She was 11 years old and had already been a refugee for most of her young life, having fled her native Afghanistan in 1993 with her parents as an infant, her mother carrying her as they walked two days and nights through the mountains to safety. She has faced many more obstacles to fight in the sport she loves, in between her first-ever karate lesson and competing in the Paris Olympics as part of the Refugee Olympic Team. Since 2022, the 31-year-old athlete has been living and training in Toronto. As a young student in Pakistan, Ms Shaheen faced harassment by older men on her way to the refugee school she attended, and bullying by her peers. In an essay in the Toronto Life magazine, she recalled: ""One day, an older man assaulted me and my sister. He screamed at us and pushed me to the ground. I wanted to punch and beat him, but I didn’t know how."" Her mother said she needed to learn how to defend herself. The school she attended didn't offer martial arts or other after-school activities for students - even if it had, it would often close, sometimes for weeks at a time, she told the BBC in an interview from Paris. But through her extended family, she heard about an instructor who was coaching karate at a nearby school. He couldn't train her there, but he could come to her. Soon after, Ms Shaheen was on the balcony at her aunt's home, getting coached. Her mother told her the balcony was all the family had to offer “but you can use it as much as you want”, she recalled. Not long after, Ms Shaheen was fighting in local karate tournaments. Her coach, noticing her talent and passion, suggested she try competing in judo. “I asked him ‘what’s judo? And how would I know what to do?’ He told me: ‘Just grab your opponent and throw her, that’s it,’” she said. Ms Shaheen was able to take down her first opponent in a few seconds. She had a knack for the sport. While winning felt good, it was the philosophy of judo that got her hooked. “(My first coach) said you will not learn how to get up unless you fall. As a kid, that really motivated me,” she said. It also reminded her of watching the WWE with her father, a wrestling fan, as a child. The sport gave her the confidence to find herself - and joy in her life - despite the hardships she faced as a refugee. Ms Shaheen’s coaches began to notice her talent. At one point she trained with Pakistan’s national judo team but could not compete alongside them without a Pakistani passport. In 2014, Ms Shaheen returned to Afghanistan, where she studied political science and public administration at the American University in Kabul. She also trained with the Afghani national team, were she was welcomed by her male colleagues. ""Inside the gym, we were a family, and they treated me like I was their sister,"" she wrote in Toronto Life. She continued to train and compete, and began to receive a lot of attention as a female athlete in Afghanistan - some of it unwanted. “I faced immense cyber bullying,” she told the BBC. The harassment later turned physical. “There were so many times when cars would chase us,” she said. Once, someone threw a soft drink can in her mother’s direction as she was dropping her off at practice. She left her home country again, in 2018. “I always say that I became a refugee for a second time,” she said. She moved to Russia for her master’s studies in international trade and entrepreneurship. But unlike the welcome she received at her gym in Afghanistan, she couldn't find a training partner in Russia. She spent the next year training alone - a time she has called ""the worst days"" of her career. In 2019, she was approached by an International Judo Federation member, who suggested she try out for the Refugee Olympic Team. She qualified for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, but a serious shoulder injury knocked her out of the competition. By then she had finished her studies in Russia and the situation in Afghanistan had deteriorated drastically. “I was just stuck,” Ms Shaheen said. She returned to Pakistan where she mostly stayed at home in fear of her safety - she had faced criticism for not wearing a headscarf during the Games - and contemplated her next steps. That’s when the opportunity to live and train in Canada opened up, with the help of the Olympic Refugee Foundation and United Nations Refugee Agency. Ms Shaheen was accepted to study in Toronto for a postgraduate degree in international development. She arrived in September 2022 - a bittersweet moment for the athlete who had already journeyed through three countries in search of stability. It was in that Canadian city where her judo career was given a new lease on life. “I was so happy to finally be at a place where I can be myself,” she said. “But it was also hard for me because I had to say goodbye to my parents for the second time.” In Paris, she is one of the 37 athletes playing for the Refugee Olympic Team - a team Ms Shaheen is grateful to be a part of. “I feel really proud,” she said ahead of her first competition on Tuesday against Mexico’s Prisca Awiti Alcaraz. “I’m as much of an Afghan as I am a refugee,” she said. The banner for the refugee team is “a flag that I can relate to”. While she lost to Ms Alcaraz, Ms Shaheen has said that she is thankful to be able to compete at the highest level. ""Even with every loss, I learn something new."" She will appear on the mat once again on Saturday, where she will represent the Refugee Olympic Team in the mixed team event - her first time doing so. ""Team events are more exciting since I always look at my teammates and feel like I can’t let them down so I fight for all of them,"" she told the International Judo Federation ahead of the competition. After the games, Ms Shaheen plans to call Canada home - she is now a permanent resident - and she hopes to one day work to assist refugees like herself. Her parents are still in Pakistan, where they are cheering her on as she lives out her Olympic dream. At her lowest points, she said she would lean on her family for support. “My sister used to tell me, ‘I trust that one day you will achieve something big, and this will be a memory and you will laugh about this.’” “Now is the time that I laugh about it.” Great Britain's Ben Maher completes a ""perfect"" clearance in the equestrian team jumping qualifier at Paris 2024.

2,2024-08-01 15:13:49.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 13:13:40.000,Can technology fix the 'broken' concert ticketing system?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cml2p8nvzp9o,2024-07-31 23:05:57.000,"For Nashville native Jacki Thrapp flying to Europe this summer to see her idol Taylor Swift perform live was a “no brainer”. With the cheapest tickets for the remaining US dates of Swift’s continuing Eras Tour now costing $2,500 (£2,000) on the resale market, up from their face value of $49, some American fans realised that it would be cheaper for them to fly across the Atlantic to catch one of the European shows instead. So back in May, Jacki went to see Swift perform twice in Sweden, with each ticket costing her less than $200. “Americans are paying so much money, and a lot of Taylor Swift fans are people in their 20s and 30s,” says the 32-year-old. “We're paying so much money to see her in the US when a lot of us still can't even afford a house.” Although Jacki bought two Swedish tickets on the secondary market, the mark-up of the most expensive was only around double its face value. This is said to be because buying resold tickets is not an established thing to do in Sweden, unlike in the US and UK. In other European countries, such as Germany, tickets cannot be resold at more than 25% above their face value. Meanwhile, some nations go even further. Italy, Portugal and the Republic of Ireland all have laws in place that prevent concert tickets being sold above their original price. In the UK and the US the price of re-sold tickets can currently be as high as people are willing to pay. In April, 250 musical artists, including Billie Eilish and Cyndi Lauper, signed an open letter that attacked ""predatory resellers"", and called the current ticking system ""broken"". The situation may change for the better in the UK in the next few years, as the Labour Party, which forms the new government, said in March that it planned to cap the resale price of tickets. Yet laws preventing excessive pricing on the secondary market do not stop two key issues – touts getting their hands on excessive amounts of tickets in the first instance, and the risk of people buying counterfeit tickets or being scammed. The latter is said to have affected hundreds of Taylor Swift fans who tried to buy tickets for her concerts in the UK this summer. Asher Weiss, chief executive of ticketing start-up Tixologi, believes that technology is the solution, particularly AI. “People [touts] will buy a ticket and list it on multiple marketplaces for secondary sale,” he says. “And then even if it sells on one, they won't take it down off the other one. “So multiple people end up with the same ticket, trying to get in,” explains Mr Weiss, whose firm is based in Los Angeles. To prevent people buying excessive numbers of tickets, he says that Tixologi’s AI “will be able to flag people making multiple purchases from the same IP address as unusual purchasing behaviour”. “That would prevent those bad actors, and protect the true fans and customers,” adds Mr Weiss. His firm is also able to ensure that only one copy of a ticket can ever exist. It does this by using blockchain, the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies. This prevents duplication. Tixologi’s electronic tickets also have a rotating QR code that is said to be extremely difficult to copy, so that fake ones are instantly spotted when scanned. And a venue or artist can select a function called “disable transfers”, which prevents a user from emailing the ticket to someone else. This makes them much harder to re-sell. UK ticketing company Seat Unique is working with London’s Wembley Stadium to sell hospitality tickets for Taylor Swift’s tour. She returns to the stadium for five shows in August, following three there in June. “It is probably the most popular event I’ve seen in 15 years,” says Robin Sherry, Seat Unique’s founder and chief executive. The company specializes in allowing venues and artists to sell their tickets via dynamic pricing. What this means is that the price is allowed to go up, and down, according to demand. The idea is that the venue and artists sell the tickets directly, and therefore get the additional income if prices rise, instead of that money going to sellers on the secondary market. To set the dynamic price Seat Unique is now using AI to constantly monitor demand and automatically respond to it. “It’s ultimately about keeping tickets in the hands of fans not scalpers,” says Mr Sherry, who also works with sports clubs and organisations. He adds that AI also has the ability to transform the marketing of concerts and other events, with adverts specifically targeted at individuals based on learning what they are interested in. “I always jokingly say, AI will know what events you want to go to before I do,” he adds, saying that this will be “revolutionary in an industry that has been slow to modernise”. While AI is starting to change how we are able buy tickets to concerts and other events, it is also beginning to appear on the stage. In November a new AI-powered hologram of Elvis Presley will be performing live in London. The creator of the Elvis Evolution production, Andrew McGuiness, says the hologram is so lifelike that it will be “less like Abba Voyage and more like time travel”. But whether AI will be the answer for fans like Jacki Thrapp remains to be seen. ""This was the first time I've ever left America to see one of my favourite artists, but there has to be a better way to do this,” she says. Both Seat Unique and Tixologi hope that better way will be delivered by advances in AI. A faulty update by the cyber-security firm last month caused chaos around the world. The two companies say they will offer drivers financial incentives to switch to electric cars. Sales of Instagram and Facebook adverts have soared, delivering a surge in profits for parent company Meta. The central bank has put up its key rate to ""around 0.25%"" as it tries to ease rising prices. Singapore officials say they are investigating the incident, which hospitalised 57 people.

2,2024-08-01 15:13:49.000,BBC News,2024-08-01 13:13:40.000,The Mexican women aiding migrants on their perilous journey north,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c720vye08y9o,2024-08-01 00:21:25.000,"Few people know how perilous the migrant journey across Mexico has become in recent months better than a group of women in the eastern state of Veracruz, known as Las Patronas. For the past 30 years, as policies towards Central American migrants have hardened on both sides of the Rio Grande, they have unfailingly kept up the same humanitarian gesture to the migrants who pass through their village. Every day, Las Patronas bag up rice, beans, tortillas, bread, tins of tuna and bottles of water. As the freight train known as La Bestia, meaning The Beast, approaches, they scramble to the side of the tracks and hold out the food for the migrants travelling on its roofs to grab as they thunder past. “Gracias! God bless you!” the migrants yell over the deafening noise of the train as it clatters north, a fleeting moment of kindness on what is one of the most dangerous migrant journeys in the world. Many will struggle to make it much further north. This year, Mexico has stopped around three times as many migrants who have crossed into its territory from Central America as it did a year ago. While the 280,000 interdictions a month by the Mexican authorities have won approval in Washington, they have made life unbearable for those on the road. “The dream that many call the American Dream has turned into a nightmare”, reflects Norma Romero, the founder of Las Patronas. Mexico and the United States are at a pivotal point in their relationship. Mexico has just chosen its first woman president, Claudia Sheinbaum, who will take office in October. The United States, meanwhile, is heading full steam into its election campaign with possibly its first female president in Kamala Harris, or a second Trump presidency on the horizon. Neither scenario gives Norma much cause for optimism. “I never put my faith in politics. Rather, I believe in ordinary people who bring about change and who have different ways of thinking,” she says, as her fellow volunteers chop vegetables to flavour the rice. Nor does she think having a woman at the helm will make any difference in terms of tackling the widespread abuses of migrants in Mexico. “Sadly, politics hasn't improved since, well, as long as I can remember. Really, there’s never been any change that has brought any benefit to migrants.” I first met Norma a decade ago when, as she showed the BBC, the freight trains were heaving with migrants fleeing violence and hardship in their home countries for the prospect of a better life in the United States. Successive Mexican governments tended not to stop people heading north if they were simply passing through. In the United States, undocumented immigration was not the polarising electoral topic that it has since become. Today, that attitude has noticeably changed. Particularly in US border states, it is the leading issue heading into November’s vote. In June, President Joe Biden issued an executive order which grants US Border Patrol the right to deport people who have crossed into the US illegally without processing their asylum-requests. In the first four weeks of the new policy, there was a 40% reduction in detentions on the US southern border. Norma says Las Patronas have seen noticeably emptier trains in recent weeks – sometimes without any migrants on them at all. She thinks the migrants are using other routes, by bus or on foot. But, she says, they remain woefully uninformed about such US policy developments or the extent of the obstacles they face on the road: “The migrants don't have the basic knowledge they need about what is involved in travelling through Mexico,” she laments. “We see what’s happening to them and try to think about their wellbeing as human beings.” Las Patronas also run a shelter where weary migrants can get a hot meal, a bed, bathe, wash their clothes and receive medical attention. Among those staying for a few days to rest and gather their strength is Guadalupe, a Salvadoran migrant travelling with her 17-year-old daughter Nicole. She says they won’t travel on La Bestia again, having twice been taken off the freight train by immigration officers. The experience, she recalls, was brutal. “They hit a lot of people who were with us and gave others electric shocks with tasers. They almost tasered me too. That was the worst experience we’ve had here in Mexico.” Given the threat of kidnappings, sexual abuse and extortion by the country’s drug cartels, traversing Mexico is one of the most fraught parts of a journey which, for some, began in the Andes or the Caribbean. Often though, says Guadalupe, they’re extorted by migration and security officials, the very men and women charged with upholding the law in Mexico. “Once they take us off the train, many migration officers demand bribes from us. If we have enough money, we can pass. This time, we didn’t, and they sent us back to the border with Guatemala. That was the hardest thing.” Mexican law enforcement has undoubtedly kept down the numbers of migrants reaching the US’s door. “There is no crisis in migration at present,” said Mexico's President, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, recently as he urged the US to bolster development aid to Central America to dissuade people from leaving home in the first place. Rather than outright deportations – Mexico only sent back around 8,500 people in the first three months of this year – the Mexican authorities have been employing a form of ‘internal removal’ instead. Thousands of detained migrants have been dropped in towns on the border with Guatemala, some 2,000 kilometres from the US border. The strategy saps the migrants of the funds and energy they need to keep going. Salvadoran migrant, Guadalupe, likens the tactic to a giant game of snakes and ladders: “It’s very similar. Just like the board game, you have to avoid stepping on the snakes or you’re back to square one. It’s the same here too. If we don’t hide or run faster than the immigration agents, then our journey ends and we’re sent all the way back to the start.” The BBC repeatedly requested an interview with the Mexican government over undocumented immigration, but no-one was made available. As another train approaches, Guadalupe helps Norma Romero and the other women to take the food down to the tracks. No matter who wins in the US, or what their relationship with President-elect Sheinbaum, Norma says Las Patronas won’t turn off their stoves as long as migrants keep coming past.

Follow the latest business news here or read through the updates below. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm, slashed Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink’s pay by 30% to $25.2 million for 2022, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The move comes after the money manager reported first-quarter revenue that was down 10% from a year ago, as rising interest rates and economic uncertainty impacted the firm’s bottom line. “With respect to 2022 compensation, management determined to reduce the impact of the firm’s decline in profitability on BlackRock’s broader employee population by concentrating the downward adjustments to total incentive awards toward senior management,” the filing said. Total compensation for Fink, 70, included a base salary of $1.5 million and $23.7 million in total incentive awards. Several other executives saw their compensation reduced, including Rob Kapito, the firm’s president, whose package shrank by 34% to $18.95 million. UBS’ purchase of Credit Suisse’s US subsidiaries can move forward, the Federal Reserve said Friday. The statement comes a month after UBS stepped in to rescue the embattled Swiss lender and prevent turmoil in the financial sector from spreading, after an emergency loan of nearly $54 billion from the Swiss National Bank failed to stop the carnage. The problems for Credit Suisse began when the Saudi National Bank, its largest backer, said it wouldn’t put up more cash after buying a nearly 10% stake in the bank for $1.5 billion in 2022. Banking customers were already on edge after the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank — so Credit Suisse shares tumbled more than 25% and saw billions of dollars of outflows. The global turmoil has led US lawmakers to call for tighter regulations on banks. The Fed board said UBS will provide a quarterly updated plan for combining UBS’s and Credit Suisse’s US business and operations. “The implementation plan will address UBS’s obligations to comply with more stringent enhanced prudential standards, including liquidity standards,” the Fed said in a statement. UBS is shelling out 3 billion Swiss francs, or $3.25 billion, for Credit Suisse. Stocks slid Friday after a slate of earnings beats from big banks fueled concerns that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its next two meetings. Still, the major indices gained for the week. The Dow rose 400 points, or 1.2%. The S&P 500 gained 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.3%. JPMorgan Chase on Friday reported first-quarter profit and revenue that crushed expectations, boosted by the Fed’s interest rate hiking campaign. Citigroup, Wells Fargo and PNC Financial also reported strong results. CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors in the company’s post-earnings conference call that they should prepare for interest rates to be higher for longer than expected. Wall Street seems to have taken note. Analysts increased their bets on a quarter-point rate hike at the Fed’s meeting in May and another in June. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Friday that the central bank needs to continue tightening monetary policy, further weighing down markets. Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said that it’s “definitely” possible the United States enters a mild recession after the tumult in banking last month. Meanwhile, retail sales data declined more than expected, suggesting that Americans’ spending power and the US economy are weakening. Consumer sentiment held fairly steady in April, even as concerns about a recession linger, according to the University of Michigan’s latest monthly survey. “There was too much news to digest this morning, but the key takeaway is that the Fed has room to do more harm,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, said in a note. The Dow slipped 144 points, or 0.4%. The S&P 500 tumbled 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite sank 0.4%. As stocks settle after the trading day, levels might still change slightly. Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said Friday he isn’t discounting the recent assessment from central bank economists that the banking crisis will tip the United States into a mild recession later this year. “There’s no way you can look at current conditions around the world and in the US and not think that some mild recession is definitely on the table as a possibility,” Goolsbee said Friday during an interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” He added that, when viewed historically, the monetary tightening campaign undertaken by the Fed — hiking interest rates nine times in just over a year — is expected to slow GDP growth. “When you get numbers like retail sales and others that are declining, if you look at construction, I think we’ve got to think about what’s the state of growth in the country,” he said. “Fortunately, the labor market continues to be very strong.” Critics have lambasted the World Bank and, particularly, the International Monetary Fund, for predicting Russia’s economy would hold relatively stable this year despite international sanctions. But sanctions are hurting Russia’s economy, even if World Bank forecasts don’t reflect it, according to the outgoing World Bank President David Malpass. Speaking to Julia Chatterley at the IMF-World Bank spring conference, David Malpass responded to criticism that you couldn’t trust GDP and economic data from Russia. He admitted “the quality of the data differs substantially by country…the reality is there’s not very much in terms of double checking of data”. In January, the IMF projected that Russia’s economy would expand by 0.3% this year and 2.1% the next. That was much more optimistic than the latest forecasts from the World Bank, which still penciled in a contraction of just 3.3% this year. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development was the most pessimistic, forecasting a 5.6% contraction in Russia’s economy in 2023. Malpass said that GDP numbers were not capturing the “reality” and “horror” of the war, and noted the Russian economy was suffering. “I think life is hard in Russia…they’re excluded from travelling to many parts of the world, their supply chains have to change dramatically… young people moving out because they don’t want to be part of this war,” Malpass said. Consumer sentiment tracked by the University of Michigan held steady in April, according to a preliminary reading released Friday. So far, the university’s monthly surveys have shown a limited impact from the banking crisis on consumers’ attitudes, but Americans remain concerned about an upcoming recession and some lingering fears about inflation persist. “Consumers are expecting a downturn, they’re not feeling as dismal as they were last summer, but they’re waiting for the other shoe to drop,” said Joanne Hsu, director of the surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan, in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Friday morning. “We now have about a month of data following the collapse of SVB, and there hasn’t really been much of an effect on sentiment at all,” she said. The latest survey also showed that higher gas prices helped push up year-ahead inflation expectations by a full percentage point, rising from 3.6% in March to 4.6% in April. “Consumers are still feeling the pain of high prices,” Hsu told Bloomberg, noting that survey respondents were now mentioning gas prices for the first time since fall. The latest cooldown in consumer and producer price hikes as well as the latest decline in retail sales are indications that the Federal Reserve’s efforts are working to bring down high inflation, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee told CNBC on Friday. “You don’t want to overreact to short-run news, but it feel likes like that’s moving in the right direction,” he said during an appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” Goolsbee was quick to note that an area of critical importance to him in advance of the next Fed meeting is activity in banking and credit. Earlier this week, Goolsbee noted that the Fed needs to be “on watch” for tighter credit conditions as a result of the banking turmoil last month. He referenced private sector analyst estimates that the spillover effects of the crisis equate to the Fed enacting rate hikes anywhere from a quarter point to three-quarters of a point. “I’m an old-school data dog,” Goolsbee said Friday. “What I would do is spend the next three weeks getting out and figuring out how much credit tightening is coming.” Chief executives at some of the largest banks in the United States were forced to address the elephant in the room as they reported first-quarter earnings on Friday morning: The regional banking crisis that brought Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank to ruin last month. > Banking industry turmoil has added to risks of recessionary “storm clouds” on the horizon, said JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon Friday in a release. He added that “the banking situation is distinct from 2008 as it has involved far fewer financial players and fewer issues that need to be resolved.” Still, said Dimon, who leads the country’s largest bank, “financial conditions will likely tighten as lenders become more conservative, and we do not know if this will slow consumer spending.” >“We are glad to have been in a strong position to help support the US financial system during the recent events that impacted the banking industry,” commented Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf in a statement. “Regional and community banks are an important part of our financial system and are uniquely positioned to serve their customers and communities.” > “I believe today’s crisis of confidence in the regional banking sector will further accelerate capital markets growth, and BlackRock will be a central player,” wrote BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on Friday. “Increased financing through the capital markets will require the scale, multi-asset capabilities and excellence in portfolio construction that BlackRock consistently delivers across market cycles,” he said in a statement. That means bad news for regional banks could be good news for BlackRock – the lack of trust in regional banks will drive more investment into capital markets and BlackRock is poised to benefit as that happens. “Throughout our history, moments of market dislocation and disruption have served as inflection points for BlackRock,” he explained. Regulators also hired BlackRock in early April to help the US government in the sale of the $114 billion in assets it collected from the collapse> Citigroup and PNC did not address the banking crisis in their releases, but will likely answer questions about how they’ve weathered the turmoil and what they see ahead at their first-quarter presentations, planned for 11 a.m. ET. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors Friday not to be caught unawares if interest rates stay higher longer than expected. “People need to be prepared. They shouldn’t pray that they don’t go up. They should prepare for them going up. And if it doesn’t happen, serendipity,” Dimon said on the company’s post-earnings conference call. High interest rates have helped big banks, including JPMorgan Chase, since they widen the gap between the interest paid to customers and what they earn from investing that money. But climbing rates also helped drive last month’s collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which held 55% of its customers deposits in long-dated bonds whose value diminished as interest rates rose. Dimon stated that he believes the banking crisis will pass — even though he expects its effects to reverberate through the sector for years to come — but that the possibility of higher interest rates should remain on companies’ radars. “If and when that happens, it will address problems in the economy. For those who are too exposed to floating rates, or those who are too exposed to [refinancing] risk, those exposures will be in multiple parts of the economy,” Dimon said. “Now would be the time to fix it. Do not put yourself in a position where that risk is excessive for your company, your business, your investment pools,” he said. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the largest US bank, told investors Friday that he isn’t too worried about a credit crunch resulting from the recent banking crisis. “I wouldn’t use the word[s] ‘credit crunch,’” he said in response to a question about whether he was worried that lending would tighten in the bank after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. There will be “a little bit of tightening,” said Dimon, but that will mostly be contained within the real estate market. Dimon added that he’s more worried about recession than a credit crunch. “I just look at it as a kind of a thumb on the scale. It just makes the financing conditions a little bit tighter and increases the odds of a recession,” he said. “That’s what that is. It’s not like a credit crunch.” JPMorgan Chase said Friday its exposure to the office sector is limited, addressing concerns about the commercial real estate industry’s stability. “Given the recent focus on commercial real estate, let me remind you that our office sector exposure is less than 10% of our portfolio and is focused in urban dense markets, and nearly two-thirds of our loans are multifamily, primarily in supply-constrained markets,” said Jeremy Barnum, chief financial officer, in the company’s post-earnings conference call. Investors and regulators are watching the $20 trillion US commercial real estate market for signs that it could be the next shoe to drop after the banking tumult last month. That’s partly because the value of buildings is going down, particularly as offices in major cities remain vacant or half-empty as Americans opt to work from home. The commercial real estate industry’s woes come after decades of unbridled growth powered by low interest rates and easy credit. That upward trend was interrupted by the Covid pandemic’s onset, and then when the Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates aggressively last year to stabilize the economy. “There are obviously some big things here and there to pay attention to, but in the scheme of things for us, not a big issue,” Barnum said. Spending at US retailers fell in March as consumers pulled back amid recessionary fears fueled by the banking crisis. Retail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation, fell by 1% in March from the prior month, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. That was steeper than an expected 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv, and above the revised 0.2% decline in the prior month. The drop was driven by a pullback in spending at department stores and on durable goods such as appliances and furniture. Spending at general merchandise stores fell 3% in March from the prior month and spending at gas stations declined 5.5% during the same period. Excluding gas station sales, retail spending retreated 0.6% in March from February. However, year-on-year retail spending rose 2.9%. Citigroup shares were up about 0.8% in premarket trading after the bank posted strong first-quarter profits, beating analyst expectations for both earnings per share and revenue. The bank brought in $21.4 billion in revenue versus expectations of $19.9 billion. Earnings per share were $2.19, estimates were for $1.67. Citi CEO Jane Fraser and CFO Mark Mason will hold an earnings presentation at 11 a.m. ET. Stocks slid Friday, even as big banks reported beats on their first-quarter earnings in an auspicious start to earnings season. Investors were watching for clues about the financial sector’s stability, and whether the tumult in the sector last month could lead to tighter lending standards. A key point of interest was also how much big banks benefitted from increased deposit inflows when nervous customers fled from regional banks after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. JPMorgan, the largest bank in the United States and an economic bellwether, posted record revenue. Wells Fargo, Citigroup and PNC Financial Services also reported earnings beats. Shares of JPMorgan Chase gained 4.8%, Wells Fargo rose 0.7%, Citigroup added 1.9% and PNC Financial Services ticked up 0.3%. Meanwhile, retail sales came in weaker than expected as recession fears loom. Retail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation, fell by 1% in March from the month before, according to the Commerce Department. Economists expected a 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv. The Dow fell 38 points, or about 0.1%. The S&P 500 sank 0.1%. The Nasdaq Composite declined 0.5%. The Federal Reserve could end its historic rate-hiking campaign after just one more quarter-point increase, said Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic in a Thursday interview with Reuters. The Fed has approved nine rate hikes in a row since last March, the effects of which are only now starting to “bite,” Bostic said. Monetary policy can take months to trickle through the economy, but a slew of recent data suggests that inflation is finally cooling. The March Consumer Price Index shows price hikes have slowed for nine months in a row, and headline wholesale inflation reflected in the Producer Price Index has sunk to 2.7% after reaching double digit highs last year. Bostic said the recent “chaos” in the banking sector, after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, persuaded him to rethink the pace of rate hikes. However, he told Reuters he believes the turmoil will not have any lasting impact on the the US economy. Analysts expect the Fed to raise rates by a quarter point at its upcoming policy meeting on May 2-3, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Regional bank PNC Financial reported first-quarter revenue of $5.6 billion and earnings per share of $3.98 vs. expectations of $3.66. Shares rose 5% on the news. Wells Fargo reported first-quarter revenue of $20.7 billion against expectations of $20.1 billion. The San Francisco-based bank saw earnings of $4.9 billion, up from $3.8 billion a year earlier, an increase of about 32%. Shares of Wells Fargo rose 2.2%. JPMorgan Chase on Friday reported first-quarter profit and revenue that roundly beat expectations, boosted by a year of rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. The New York-based bank posted a profit of $12.6 billion or $4.10 per share. That’s up from $8.3 billion, or $2.63 per share from the same period a year before. Analysts expected earnings of $3.41 per share, according to Refinitiv. With $3.67 trillion in assets, JPMorgan Chase is the largest bank in the United States and a bellwether for the US economy. “The US economy continues to be on generally healthy footings — consumers are still spending and have strong balance sheets, and businesses are in good shape. However, the storm clouds that we have been monitoring for the past year remain on the horizon,” CEO Jamie Dimon said in a press release. Net interest income rose to $20.8 billion, up 49% from the prior year, driven by the aggressive interest rate campaign the Fed kicked off last year to stabilize prices. Deposits rose to $2.38 trillion during the first quarter from $2.34 trillion in the quarter ended in December. That comes after the banking tumult last month triggered a rush into big banks from nervous customers. Investors also looked to money market funds as a haven. A key point of conversation after last month’s turmoil in the banking sector has been whether banks could tighten lending standards, leading customers to spend less as it becomes more difficult to borrow money for large purchases like homes and cars. “Financial conditions will likely tighten as lenders become more conservative, and we do not know if this will slow consumer spending,” Dimon said, adding that JPMorgan Chase is “confident that we can serve the needs of our customers and clients in all environments.” Shares of JPMorgan Chase climbed 6.1% in pre-market trading. The company’s post-earnings conference call is slated for 8:30 a.m. ET. Stocks: US stock futures fell ahead of several bank earnings this morning. Investors also fretted a retail sales report that is expected to show consumers are pulling back on their spending. Dow futures were down 75 points, or 0.2%. S&P 500 futures fell 0.2%. Nasdaq futures were 0.4% lower. European stocks were higher and Asian stocks closed up. Fear & Greed Index: 67 = Greed Oil & gas: US oil prices were up 0.3% to $82 a barrel. Average US gas prices rose to $3.66 a gallon. Wall Street is searching for answers to two key questions: Is the economy headed for a recession? And, if so, who’s poised to weather it? Recession fears have ramped up in recent weeks after the banking tumult last month raised concerns about the financial sector’s health. Earnings season for banks starts on Friday with JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, BlackRock, Citigroup and PNC Financial Services slated to report before the bell. Investors will be watching for clues about stability. Stocks have yet to price in the economy’s precarious position, with the S&P 500 adding about 7% this year. But markets have already seen volatile trading since then. “We’re going to see a correction happen here, because it just never makes sense when the market’s going up and earnings are going down,” says Eric Sterner, chief investment officer at Apollon Wealth Management. But while earnings are an undeniable factor driving markets, inflation remains a key concern. Wall Street remains overly optimistic that the Fed will cut rates later this year — even after officials indicated last month that they likely won’t — or that it could even orchestrate a soft landing. That hope, and the market’s resilience, could start to crumble in the next few weeks, said Megan Horneman, chief investment officer at Verdence Capital Advisors. “You very well could see that catalyst over the next couple of weeks with earnings, and then this inflation data and then what the Fed says when they meet,” said Horneman. Jeremy Grantham made his name predicting the dot-com crash in 2000 and the financial crisis in 2008. Now, the famous investor warns another epic bubble in financial markets is bursting — and the turmoil that swept through the banking sector last month is just the beginning. “Other things will break, and who knows what they will be,” Grantham told CNN in an exclusive interview. “We’re by no means finished with the stress to the financial system.” Since early 2022, when the S&P 500 hit an all-time high, US stocks have dropped about 15% as central banks have jacked up borrowing costs. But Grantham sees much steeper declines on the horizon. The “best we can hope for,” he said, is a fall of about 27% from current levels, while the worst-case scenario would see a plunge of more than 50%. The low point might not arrive until “deep into next year,” he added. Grantham sees uncomfortable parallels between markets today and 2000, when an explosion in the price of tech stocks was followed by a dizzying crash. There are also echoes of 2008, when a painful comedown in the US housing market almost broke the banking system. What’s even more worrying is that this time, bubbles in the stock market and the real estate market are poised to burst simultaneously, Grantham said. The broader US banking system remains sound and stable, but the two regional banks that failed were “poorly managed” and “took unacceptable risks,” White House economic adviser Lael Brainard told CNN’s Poppy Harlow in an interview Wednesday at Semafor’s World Economy Summit in Washington, DC. Last month’s collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank roiled markets and spread fear through the economy of a possible wider banking crisis. The US Treasury, Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation all intervened to ensure bank customers could access all their money and to attempt to stave off future bank runs. “The banking system, it’s very sound, it’s stable; the core of the banking system has a great deal of capital that was put in place in the wake of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis,” said Brainard, director of the White House National Economic Council. “There were some banks who were not managing their risks effectively. They failed, and the president took strong actions along with the Secretary of the Treasury and the banking regulators,” she said. “Those actions reassured Americans their deposits are safe, the banking system is sound; but it was also important to the president that the executives of those failed banks were held accountable and, very important, that taxpayer money not be at risk,” she continued. Before its collapse last month, Silicon Valley Bank was known to investors of color as a place that fostered a community of minority entrepreneurs and provided them with both social and financial capital. SVB regularly sponsored conferences and networking events for minority entrepreneurs, and it was well known for funding the annual State of Black Venture Report spearheaded by BLK VC, a nonprofit organization that connects and empowers Black investors. “When other banks were saying no, SVB would say yes,” said Joynicole Martinez, a 25-year entrepreneur and chief advancement and innovation officer for Rising Tide Capital, a nonprofit organization founded in 2004 to connect entrepreneurs with investors and mentors. Minority business owners have long faced challenges accessing capital due to discriminatory lending practices, experts say. Data from the Small Business Credit Survey, a collaboration of all 12 Federal Reserve banks, shows disparities on denial rates for bank and nonbank loans. In 2021, about 16% of Black-led companies acquired the total amount of business financing they sought from banks, compared to 35% of White-owned companies, the survey shows. “We know there’s historic, systemic, and just blatant racism that’s inherent in lending and banking. We have to start there and not tip-toe around it,” Martinez told CNN. The Financial Services Forum, an organization representing the eight largest financial institutions in the United States has said banks have committed millions of dollars since 2020 to address economic and racial inequality.

1,2024-08-02 07:37:00.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-02 05:16:08.000,Still haven't filed your taxes? Here's what you need to know,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/13/success/tax-filing-tips/index.html,2023-04-14 20:07:40.000,"Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks So far this tax season, the IRS has received more than 100 million income tax returns for 2022. That means tens of millions of households have yet to file their returns. If yours is among them, here are some last-minute tax-filing tips to keep in mind as the Tuesday, April 18 deadline approaches. Not everyone has to file on April 18: If you live in a federally declared disaster area, have a business there — or have relevant tax documents stored by businesses in that area — it’s likely the IRS has already extended the filing and payment deadlines for you. Here is where you can find the specific extension dates for each disaster area. Thanks to many rounds of extreme weather in recent months, for instance, tax filers in most of California — which accounts for 10% to 15% of all federal filers — have already been granted an extension until Oct. 16 to file and to pay, according to an IRS spokesperson. If you’re in the armed forces and are currently or were recently stationed in a combat zone, the filing and payment deadlines for your 2022 taxes are most likely extended by 180 days. But your specific extended filing and payment deadlines will depend on the day you leave (or left) the combat zone. This IRS publication offers more detail. Taxes and adulting: What to know about filing taxes on your own for the first time Lastly, if you made little to no money last year (typically less than $12,950 for single filers and $25,900 for married couples), you may not be required to file a return. But you may want to anyway if you think you are eligible for a refund thanks to, for instance, refundable tax credits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit. (Use this IRS tool to gauge whether you are required to file this year.) You also are likely eligible to use IRS Free File (intended for those with adjusted gross income of $73,000 or less) so it won’t cost you to submit a return. Your paycheck may not be your only source of income: If you had one full-time job you may think that is the only income you made and have to report. But that’s not necessarily so. Other potentially taxable and reportable income sources include: Organize your tax documents: By now you should have received every tax document that third parties are required to send you (your employer, bank, brokerage, etc.). If you don’t recall receiving a hard copy of a tax form in the mail, check your email and your online accounts — a document may have been sent to you electronically. Here are some of the tax forms you may have received: “Be aware that there’s no form for some taxable income, like proceeds from renting out your vacation property, meaning you’re responsible for reporting it on your own,” according to the Illinois CPA Society. One very last-minute way to reduce your 2022 tax bill: If you’re eligible to make a tax-deductible contribution to an IRA and haven’t done so for last year, you have until April 18 to contribute up to $6,000 ($7,000 if you’re 50 or older). That will reduce your tax bill and augment your retirement savings. Proofread your return before submitting it: Do this whether you’re using tax software or working with a professional tax preparer. Little mistakes and oversights delay the processing of your return (and the issuance of your refund if you’re owed one). You want to avoid things like having a typo in your name, birth date, Social Security number or direct deposit number; choosing the wrong filing status (e.g., married vs single); making a simple math error; or leaving a required field blank. What to do if you can’t file by April 18: If you’re not able to file by next Tuesday, fill out Form 4868 electronically or on paper and send it in by April 18. You will be granted an automatic six-month extension to file. Your tax refund may be smaller this year. Here's why Note, however, that an extension to file is not an extension to pay. You will be charged interest (currently running at 7%) and a penalty on any amount you still owe for 2022 but haven’t paid by April 18. So if you suspect you still owe tax — perhaps you had some income outside of your job for which tax wasn’t withheld or you had a big capital gain last year — approximate how much more you owe and send that money to the IRS by Tuesday. You can choose to do so by mail, attaching a check to your extension request form. Make sure your envelope is postmarked no later than April 18. Or the more efficient route is pay what you owe electronically at IRS.gov, said CPA Damien Martin, a tax partner at EY. If you do that, the IRS notes you will not have to file a Form 4868. “The IRS will automatically process an extension of time to file,” the agency notes in its instructions. If you opt to electronically pay directly from your bank account, which is free, select “extension” and then “tax year 2022” when given the option. You can also pay by credit or debit card, but you will be charged a processing fee. Doing so, though, may become much more costly than just a fee if you charge your tax payment but don’t pay your credit card bill off in full every month, since you likely pay a high interest rate on outstanding balances. If you still owe income taxes to your state, remember that you may need to go through a similar exercise of filing for an extension and making a payment to your state’s revenue department, Martin said. Use this interactive tax assistant for basic questions you may have: The IRS provides an “interactive tax assistant” that can help you answer more than 50 basic questions pertaining to your individual circumstance on income, deductions, credits and other technical questions.

1,2024-08-02 07:37:00.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-02 05:16:08.000,Retail spending fell in March as consumers pull back,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/14/economy/march-retail-sales/index.html,2023-04-14 14:29:52.000,"Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Spending at US retailers fell in March as consumers pulled back after the banking crisis fueled recession fears. Retail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation, fell by 1% in March from the prior month, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. That was steeper than an expected 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv, and above the revised 0.2% decline in the prior month. Investors chalk up some of the weakness to a lack of tax returns and concerns about a slowing labor market. The IRS issued $84 billion in tax refunds this March, about $25 billion less than they issued in March of 2022, according to BofA analysts. That led consumers to pull back in spending at department stores and on durable goods, such as appliances and furniture. Spending at general merchandise stores fell 3% in March from the prior month and spending at gas stations declined 5.5% during the same period. Excluding gas station sales, retail spending retreated 0.6% in March from February. However, retail spending rose 2.9% year-over-year. Smaller tax returns likely played a role in last month’s decline in retail sales, along with the expiration of enhanced food assistance benefits, economists say. “March is a really important month for refunds. Some folks might have been expecting something similar to last year,” Aditya Bhave, senior US economist at BofA Global Research, told CNN. Credit and debit card spending per household tracked by Bank of America researchers moderated in March to its slowest pace in more than two years, which was likely the result of smaller returns and expired benefits, coupled with slowing wage growth. Enhanced pandemic-era benefits provided through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program expired in February, which might have also held back spending in March, according to a Bank of America Institute report. Average hourly earnings grew 4.2% in March from a year earlier, down from the prior month’s annualized 4.6% increase and the smallest annual rise since June 2021, according to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Employment Cost Index, a more comprehensive measure of wages, has also shown that worker pay gains have moderated this past year. ECI data for the first quarter of this year will be released later this month. Still, the US labor market remains solid, even though it has lost momentum recently. That could hold up consumer spending in the coming months, said Michelle Meyer, North America chief economist at Mastercard Economics Institute. “The big picture is still favorable for the consumer when you think about their income growth, their balance sheet and the health of the labor market,” Meyer said. Employers added 236,000 jobs in March, a robust gain by historical standards but smaller than the average monthly pace of job growth in the prior six months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The latest monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, showed that the number of available jobs remained elevated in February — but was down more than 17% from its peak of 12 million in March 2022, and revised data showed that weekly claims for US unemployment benefits were higher than previously reported. The job market could cool further in the coming months. Economists at the Federal Reserve expect the US economy to head into a recession later in the year as the lagged effects of higher interest rates take a deeper hold. Fed economists had forecast subdued growth, with risks of a recession, prior to the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. For consumers, the effects of last month’s turbulence in the banking industry have been limited so far. Consumer sentiment tracked by the University of Michigan worsened slightly in March during the bank failures, but it had already shown signs of deteriorating before then. The latest consumer sentiment reading, released Friday morning, showed that sentiment held steady in April despite the banking crisis, but that higher gas prices helped push up year-ahead inflation expectations by a full percentage point, rising from 3.6% in March to 4.6% in April. “On net, consumers did not perceive material changes in the economic environment in April,” Joanne Hsu, director of the surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan, said in a news release. “Consumers are expecting a downturn, they’re not feeling as dismal as they were last summer, but they’re waiting for the other shoe to drop,” Hsu told Bloomberg TV in an interview Friday morning.

1,2024-08-02 07:37:00.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-02 05:16:08.000,Analysis: Fox News is about to enter the true No Spin Zone,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/14/media/fox-news-dominion-hnk-intl/index.html,2023-04-14 06:41:00.000,"Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks This is it. The media defamation trial of the century is on the precipice of kicking off in Wilmington, Delaware, in just days. Jury selection in Dominion Voting Systems’ monster $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit took place all of Thursday, with 300 potential jurors being summoned to court. Good progress was made and the presiding judge noted that there were “more than enough jurors” to start the trial as scheduled on Monday. It is there, in Courtroom 7E, where the biggest figures in Murdoch Media, accompanied by a throng of high-powered lawyers, will attempt to mount their defense after repeatedly failing to convince a judge to toss the now-historic case. A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. It’s, frankly, extraordinary to write those words. When I watched Fox News broadcast election lies in the aftermath of the 2020 election, never did I expect the network to be held accountable in a meaningful way. I’ve covered Fox News for a while now. I’ve watched thousands and thousands of hours of the right-wing channel’s programming. I’ve seen its hosts over the years undermine public health, make gross anti-immigrant remarks, peddle lies and propaganda and push deranged conspiracy theories that were once reserved for the right-wing’s furthest fringes. The network has always seemed to find a way to sail through the controversy, even the most hellish storms it has faced. Sometimes it has emerged even stronger and more emboldened than before. But this time is different. This time, the normal tricks the network turns to during times of crisis will not free it from trouble. This time, in a court of law, the network will need to put forward an honest, fact-driven argument. Fox News is about to enter the true No Spin Zone, where deception is strictly prohibited. Where it is not in charge. And where its top executives like Rupert Murdoch and Suzanne Scott and hosts like Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity cannot simply ignore a request for comment and resort to, instead, attacking “the media” on-air. In this setting, where lies cannot be casually told and truth cannot be distorted beyond reality to fit a dishonest narrative, it will be fascinating to see how the network fares. If the pre-trial hearings are any indicator, it won’t be pretty. The case hasn’t even started and the presiding judge has already lost his patience with Fox’s legal team and put them on notice. Perhaps the winds will shift for Fox News when the judge gavels in the trial on Monday. But if they play out like the last few weeks of court have, Fox News is in for a brutal ride.

1,2024-08-02 07:37:00.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-02 05:16:08.000,Silicon Valley Bank collapse renews calls to address disparities impacting entrepreneurs of color ,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/13/business/silicon-valley-bank-entrepreneurs-of-color-reaj/index.html,2023-04-13 21:13:04.000,"Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks When customers at Silicon Valley Bank rushed to withdraw billions of dollars last month, venture capitalist Arlan Hamilton stepped in to help some of the founders of color who panicked about losing access to payroll funds. As a Black woman with nearly 10 years of business experience, Hamilton knew the options for those startup founders were limited. SVB had a reputation for servicing people from underrepresented communities like hers. Its failure has reignited concerns from industry experts about lending discrimination in the banking industry and the resulting disparities in capital for people of color. Hamilton, the 43-year-old founder and managing partner of Backstage Capital, said that when it comes to entrepreneurs of color, “we’re already in the smaller house. We already have the rickety door and the thinner walls. And so, when a tornado comes by, we’re going to get hit harder.” Established in 1983, the midsize California tech lender was America’s 16th largest bank at the end of 2022 before it collapsed on March 10. SVB provided banking services to nearly half of all venture-backed technology and life-sciences companies in the United States. Hamilton, industry experts and other investors told CNN the bank was committed to fostering a community of minority entrepreneurs and provided them with both social and financial capital. SVB regularly sponsored conferences and networking events for minority entrepreneurs, said Hamilton, and it was well known for funding the annual State of Black Venture Report spearheaded by BLK VC, a nonprofit organization that connects and empowers Black investors. “When other banks were saying no, SVB would say yes,” said Joynicole Martinez, a 25-year entrepreneur and chief advancement and innovation officer for Rising Tide Capital, a nonprofit organization founded in 2004 to connect entrepreneurs with investors and mentors. Martinez is also an official member of the Forbes Coaches Council, an invitation-only organization for business and career coaches. She said SVB was an invaluable resource for entrepreneurs of color and offered their clients discounted tech tools and research funding. Minority business owners have long faced challenges accessing capital due to discriminatory lending practices, experts say. Data from the Small Business Credit Survey, a collaboration of all 12 Federal Reserve banks, shows disparities on denial rates for bank and nonbank loans. In 2021, about 16% of Black-led companies acquired the total amount of business financing they sought from banks, compared to 35% of White-owned companies, the survey shows. “We know there’s historic, systemic, and just blatant racism that’s inherent in lending and banking. We have to start there and not tip-toe around it,” Martinez told CNN. Asya Bradley is an immigrant founder of multiple tech companies like Kinley, a financial services business aiming to help Black Americans build generational wealth. Following SVB’s collapse, Bradley said she joined a WhatsApp group of more than 1,000 immigrant business founders. Members of the group quickly mobilized to support one another, she said. Immigrant founders often don’t have Social Security numbers nor permanent addresses in the United States, Bradley said, and it was crucial to brainstorm different ways to find funding in a system that doesn’t recognize them. “The community was really special because a lot of these folks then were sharing different things that they had done to achieve success in terms of getting accounts in different places. They also were able to share different regional banks that have stood up and been like, ‘Hey, if you have accounts at SVB, we can help you guys,’” Bradley said. Many women, people of color and immigrants opt for community or regional banks like SVB, Bradley says, because they are often rejected from the “top four banks” — JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citibank. In her case, Bradley said her gender might have been an issue when she could only open a business account at one of the “top four banks” when her brother co-signed for her. “The top four don’t want our business. The top four are rejecting us consistently. The top four do not give us the service that we deserve. And that’s why we’ve gone to community banks and regional banks such as SVB,” Bradley said. None of the top four banks provided a comment to CNN. The Financial Services Forum, an organization representing the eight largest financial institutions in the United States has said the banks have committed millions of dollars since 2020 to address economic and racial inequality. Last week, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told CNN’s Poppy Harlow that his bank has 30% of its branches in lower-income neighborhoods as part of a $30 billion commitment to Black and Brown communities across the country. Wells Fargo specifically pointed to its 2022 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion report, which discusses the bank’s recent initiatives to reach underserved communities. The bank partnered last year with the Black Economic Alliance to initiate the Black Entrepreneur Fund — a $50 million seed, startup, and early-stage capital fund for businesses founded or led by Black and African American entrepreneurs. And since May 2021, Wells Fargo has invested in 13 Minority Depository Institutions, fulfilling its $50 million pledge to support Black-owned banks. Black-owned banks work to close the lending gap and foster economic empowerment in these traditionally excluded communities, but their numbers have been dwindling over the years, and they have far fewer assets at their disposal than the top banks. OneUnited Bank, the largest Black-owned bank in the United States, manages a little over $650 million in assets. By comparison, JPMorgan Chase manages $3.7 trillion in assets. Because of these disparities, entrepreneurs also seek funding from venture capitalists. In the early 2010s, Hamilton intended to start her own tech company — but as she searched for investors, she saw that White men control nearly all venture capital dollars. That experience led her to establish Backstage Capital, a venture capital fund that invests in new companies led by underrepresented founders. “I said, ‘Well, instead of trying to raise money for one company, let me try to raise for a venture fund that will invest in underrepresented — and now we call them underestimated — founders who are women, people of color, and LGBTQ specifically,’ because I am all three,” Hamilton told CNN. Since then, Backstage Capital has amassed a portfolio of nearly 150 different companies and has made over 120 diversity investments, according to data from Crunchbase. But Bradley, who is also an ‘angel investor’ of minority-owned businesses, said she remains “really hopeful” that community banks, regional banks and fintechs “will all stand up and say, ‘Hey, we are not going to let the good work of SVB go to waste.’” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

In addition to water loss due to an intense multiyear drought, the US Geological Survey and the Bureau of Reclamation report found, Lake Powell faced an average annual loss in storage capacity of about 33,270 acre-feet, or 11 billion gallons, per year between 1963 and 2018. That’s enough water to fill the Reflecting Pool on the National Mall about 1,600 times. The capacity of the reservoir is shrinking because of sediments flowing in from the Colorado and San Juan rivers, according to the report. Those sediments settle at the bottom of the reservoir and decrease the total amount of water the reservoir can hold. As of Monday, Lake Powell was around 25% full, according to data from the Bureau of Reclamation. It’s bad news for a region already facing water shortages and extreme wildfires due to the drought. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration drought experts said last week these conditions are expected to at least continue – if not worsen – in the coming months. Lake Powell is an important reservoir in the Colorado River Basin. Both Lake Powell and nearby Lake Mead, the nation’s largest reservoir, have drained at an alarming rate. In August, the federal government declared a water shortage on the Colorado River for the first time after Lake Mead’s water level plunged to unprecedented lows, triggering mandatory water consumption cuts for states in the Southwest that began in January. And last week, Lake Powell dipped below the critical threshold of 3,525 feet above sea level, sparking additional concerns about water supply and hydropower generation millions of people in the West rely on for electricity. The significance of the dwindling water supply along the Colorado cannot be overstated. The system supplies water for more than 40 million people living across seven Western states and Mexico. Lakes Powell and Mead provide a critical supply of drinking water and irrigation for many across the region, including rural farms, ranches and native communities. “It is vitally important we have the best-available scientific information like this report to provide a clear understanding of water availability in Lake Powell as we plan for the future,” Tanya Trujillo, assistant secretary for water and science with the US Department of Interior, said in a statement. “The Colorado River system faces multiple challenges, including the effects of a 22-year-long drought and the increased impacts of climate change.” © 2024 Cable News Network.

The report by IQAir, a company that tracks global air quality, found that average annual air pollution in every country — and 97% of cities — exceeded the World Health Organization’s air quality guidelines, which were designed to help governments craft regulations to protect public health. Related article Not only is Lake Powell's water level plummeting because of drought, its total capacity is shrinking, too Only 222 cities of the 6,475 analyzed had average air quality that met WHO’s standard. Three territories were found to have met WHO guidelines: the French territory of New Caledonia and the United States territories of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. India, Pakistan and Bangladesh were among the countries with the worst air pollution, exceeding the guidelines by at least 10 times. The Scandinavian countries, Australia, Canada, Japan and United Kingdom ranked among the best countries for air quality, with average levels that exceeded the guidelines by 1 to 2 times. In the United States, IQAir found air pollution exceeded WHO guidelines by 2 to 3 times in 2021. “This report underscores the need for governments around the world to help reduce global air pollution,” Glory Dolphin Hammes, CEO of IQAir North America, told CNN. “(Fine particulate matter) kills far too many people every year and governments need to set more stringent air quality national standards and explore better foreign policies that promote better air quality.” Above: IQAir analyzed average annual air quality for more than 6,000 cities and categorized them from best air quality, in blue (Meets WHO PM2.5 guildline) to worst, in purple (Exceeds WHO PM2.5 guideline by over 10 times). An interactive map is available from IQAir. It’s the first major global air quality report based on WHO’s new annual air pollution guidelines, which were updated in September 2021. The new guidelines halved the acceptable concentration of fine particulate matter — or PM 2.5 — from 10 down to 5 micrograms per cubic meter. PM 2.5 is the tiniest pollutant yet also among the most dangerous. When inhaled, it travels deep into lung tissue where it can enter the bloodstream. It comes from sources like the burning of fossil fuels, dust storms and wildfires, and has been linked to a number of health threats including asthma, heart disease and other respiratory illnesses. Related article Allergy season will start much earlier than normal and be far more intense because of climate crisis, study suggests Millions of people die each year from air quality issues. In 2016, around 4.2 million premature deaths were associated with fine particulate matter, according to WHO. If the 2021 guidelines had been applied that year, WHO found there could have been nearly 3.3 million fewer pollution-related deaths. IQAir analyzed pollution-monitoring stations in 6,475 cities across 117 countries, regions and territories. In the US, air pollution spiked in 2021 compared to 2020. Out of the more than 2,400 US cities analyzed, Los Angeles air remained the most polluted, despite seeing a 6% decrease compared to 2020. Atlanta and Minneapolis saw significant increases in pollution, the report showed. “The (United States’) reliance on fossil fuels, increasing severity of wildfires as well as varying enforcement of the Clean Air Act from administration to administration have all added to U.S. air pollution,” the authors wrote. Researchers say the main sources of pollution in the US were fossil fuel-powered transportation, energy production and wildfires, which wreak havoc on the country’s most vulnerable and marginalized communities. “We are heavily dependent on fossil fuels, especially in terms of transportation,” said Hammes, who lives a few miles from Los Angeles. “We can act smartly on this with zero emissions, but we’re still not doing it. And this is having a devastating impact on the air pollution that we’re seeing in major cities.” Related article Big-box stores could help slash emissions and save millions by putting solar panels on roofs. Why aren't more of them doing it? Climate change-fueled wildfires played a significant role in reducing air quality in the US in 2021. The authors pointed to a number of fires that led to hazardous air pollution — including the Caldor and Dixie fires in California, as well as the Bootleg Fire in Oregon, which wafted smoke all the way to the East Coast in July. China — which is among the countries with the worst air pollution — showed improved air quality in 2021. More than half of the Chinese cities analyzed in the report saw lower levels of air pollution compared to the previous year. The capital city of Beijing continued a five-year trend of improved air quality, according to the report, due to a policy-driven drawdown of polluting industries in the city. The report also found that the Amazon Rainforest, which had acted as the world’s major defender against the climate crisis, emitted more carbon dioxide than it absorbed last year. Deforestation and wildfires have threatened the critical ecosystem, polluted the air and contributed to climate change. “This is all a part of the formula that will lead to or is leading to global warming.” Hammes said. The report also unveiled some inequalities: Monitoring stations remain scant in some developing countries in Africa, South America and the Middle East, resulting in a dearth of air quality data in those regions. “When you don’t have that data, you’re really in the dark,” Hammes said. Related article Could Russia's war kick-start a renewable-energy revolution? It depends where in the world you look Hammes noted the African country of Chad was included in the report for the first time, due to an improvement in its monitoring network. IQAir found the country’s air pollution was the second-highest in the world last year, behind Bangladesh. Tarik Benmarhnia, a climate change epidemiologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography who has studied the health impact of wildfire smoke, also noted that relying only on monitoring stations can lead to blind spots in these reports. “I think it is great that they relied on different networks and not only governmental sources,” Benmarhnia, who was not involved in this report, told CNN. “However, many regions do not have enough stations and alternative techniques exist.” The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded in its 2021 report that, in addition to slowing the speed of global warming, curbing the use of fossil fuels would have the added benefit of improving air quality and public health. Hammes said the IQAir report is even more reason for the world to wean off fossil fuel. “We’ve got the report, we can read it, we can internalize it and really devote ourselves to taking action,” she said. “There needs to be a major move towards renewable energy. We need to take drastic action in order to reverse the tide of global warming; otherwise, the impact and the train that we’re on (would be) irreversible.” © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

1,2024-08-02 07:37:00.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-02 05:16:08.000,Big-box stores could help slash emissions and save millions by putting solar panels on roofs. Why aren't more of them doing it?,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/20/us/solar-power-on-big-box-store-rooftops-climate/index.html,2022-03-20 07:01:50.000,"As the US attempts to wean itself off its heavy reliance on fossil fuels and shift to cleaner energy sources, many experts are eyeing a promising solution: your neighborhood big-box stores and shopping malls. The rooftops and parking lot space available at retail giants like Walmart, Target and Costco is massive. And these largely empty spaces are being touted as untapped potential for solar power that could help the US reduce its dependency on foreign energy, slash planet-warming emissions and save companies millions of dollars in the process. At the IKEA store in Baltimore, installing solar panels on the roof and over the store’s parking lot cut the amount of energy it needed to purchase by 84%, slashing its costs by 57% from September to December of 2020, according to the company. (The panels also provide some beneficial shade to keep customers’ cars cool on hot, sunny days.) Related article Could Russia's war kick-start a renewable-energy revolution? It depends where in the world you look As of February 2021, IKEA had 54 solar arrays installed across 90% of its US locations. Big-box stores and shopping centers have enough roof space to produce half of their annual electricity needs from solar, according to a report from nonprofit Environment America and research firm Frontier Group. Leveraging the full rooftop solar potential of these superstores would generate enough electricity to power nearly 8 million average homes, the report concluded, and would cut the same amount of planet-warming emissions as pulling 11.3 million gas-powered cars off the road. The average Walmart store, for example, has 180,000 square feet of rooftop, according to the report. That’s roughly the size of three football fields and enough space to support solar energy that could power the equivalent of 200 homes, the report said. “Every rooftop in America that isn’t producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them,” Johanna Neumann, senior director for Environment America’s campaign for 100% Renewable, told CNN. “Now is the time to lean into local renewable energy production, and there’s no better place than the roofs of America’s big-box superstores.” Advocates involved in clean energy worker-training programs tell CNN that a solar revolution in big-box retail would also be a significant windfall for local communities, spurring economic growth while tackling the climate crisis, which has inflicted disproportionate harm on marginalized communities. Yet only a fraction of big-box stores in the US have solar on their rooftops or solar canopies in parking lots, the report’s authors told CNN. Related article Why record-high gas prices won't be solved by drilling more oil in the US CNN reached out to five of the top US retailers — Walmart, Kroger, Home Depot, Costco and Target — to ask: Why not invest in more rooftop solar? Many renewable energy experts point to solar as a relatively simple solution to cut down on costs and help rein in fossil fuel emissions, but the companies point to several roadblocks — regulations, labor costs and structural integrity of the rooftops themselves — that are preventing more widespread adoption. The need for these kinds of clean energy initiatives is becoming “unquestionably urgent” as the climate crisis accelerates, said Edwin Cowen, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Cornell University. “We are behind the eight ball, to put it mildly,” Cowen told CNN. “I would have loved to see policy help incentivize rooftop solar 15 years ago instead of five years ago in the commercial space. There’s still a tremendous amount of work to do.” Neumann said Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, possesses by far the largest solar potential. Walmart has around 5,000 stores in the US and more than 783 million square feet of rooftop space — an area larger than Manhattan — and more than 8,974 gigawatt hours of annual rooftop solar potential, according to the report. It’s enough electricity to power more than 842,000 homes, the report said. “Every rooftop in America that isn’t producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them.” Johanna Neumann, Environment America Walmart spokesperson Mariel Messier told CNN the company is involved in renewable energy projects around the world, but many of them are not rooftop solar installations. The company has reported having completed on- and off-site wind and solar projects or had others under development with a capacity to produce more than 2.3 gigawatts of renewable energy. Neumann said Environment America has met with Walmart a few times, urging the retailer to commit to installing solar panels on roofs and in parking lots. The company has said it’s aiming to source 100% of its energy through renewable projects by 2035. “Of all the retailers in America, Walmart stands to make the biggest impact if they put rooftop solar on all of their stores,” Neumann told CNN. “And for us, this report just underscores just how much of an impact they could make if they make that decision.” According to Environment America, Walmart had installed almost 194 megawatts of solar capacity on its US facilities as of the end of the 2021 fiscal year and additional capacity in off-site solar farms. The company’s installations in California were expected to provide between 20% to 30% of each location’s electricity needs. Target ranked No. 1 for on-site solar capacity in 2019, according to industry trade group Solar Energy Industries Association’s most recent report. It currently has 542 locations with rooftop solar — around a quarter of the company’s stores — a Target spokesperson told CNN. Rooftop solar generates enough energy to meet 15% to 40% of Target properties’ energy needs, the spokesperson said. Richard Galanti, the chief financial officer at Costco, said the company has 121 stores with rooftop solar around the world, 95 of which are in the US. Walmart, Target and Costco did not share with CNN what their biggest barriers are to adding rooftop or parking lot solar panels to more stores.  “My suspicion is that they want an even stronger business case for deviating from business-as-usual,” Neumann said. “Historically, all those roofs have done is cover their stores, and rethinking how [they] use their buildings and thinking of them as energy generators, not just protection from rain, requires a small change in their business model.” Home Depot, which has around 2,300 stores, currently has 75 completed rooftop solar projects, 12 in construction and more than 30 planned for future development, said Craig D’Arcy, the company’s director of energy management. Solar power generates around half of these stores’ energy needs on average, he said. Aging rooftops at stores are a “huge impediment” to solar installation, D’Arcy added. If a roof needs to be replaced in the next 15 to 20 years or sooner, it doesn’t make financial sense for Home Depot to add solar systems today, he said. “We have a goal of implementing solar rooftop where the economics are attractive,” D’Arcy told CNN. CNN also reached out to Kroger, which owns about 2,800 stores across the US. Kristal Howard, a Kroger spokesperson, said the company currently has 15 properties — stores, distribution centers and manufacturing plants — with solar installations. One of the “multiple factors affecting the viability of a solar installation” was the stores’ ability to support a solar installation on the roofs, Howard said. Cowen, the engineering professor at Cornell, said solar is already attractive, but that labor costs, incentives and the different layers of regulation likely pose some financial challenges in solar installations. “For them, this means usually hiring a local site firm that can do that installation that also knows local policy,” Cowen said. “It’s just another layer of complexity that I think is beginning to make sense because the costs have come down enough, but it needs kind of reopening that door of getting into an existing building.” Related article 'Delay means death': We're running out of ways to adapt to the climate crisis, new report shows. Here are the key takeaways Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois, who co-chairs the power sector task force in the House, said the US has “failed to provide the incentives to people who have the expertise to go in and build these things.” The reason both retail companies and the power sector have not made much progress on solar is because “our system is so disjointed” and has a complex regulation structure, Casten said. “Why aren’t we doing something that makes economic sense? The answer is this horribly disjointed federal policy where we massively subsidize fossil energy extraction, and we penalize clean energy production,” Casten told CNN. “For a long, long time, if you wanted to build a solar panel on the rooftop of Walmart, your biggest enemy was going to be your local utility because they didn’t want to lose the load. “We could have done this decades ago,” Casten added. “And had we done it, we would not be in this dire position with the climate, but we’d also have a lot more money in our pocket.” For Charles Callaway, director of organizing at the nonprofit group WE ACT for Environmental Justice, strengthening the rooftop solar capacity in big box retail stores is a no-brainer, especially if companies allow the local community to reap benefits either through installation jobs or sharing the electricity produced later. Either way, it would put a massive dent in curbing the climate crisis and help usher in an equitable transition away from fossil fuels — and it’s doable, Callaway told CNN. The New York City resident led a worker training program that helped train more than 100 local community members, mostly people of color, to become solar installers. He also formed a solar workers cooperative to ensure many of the participants of the training program get jobs in a tough market. In the last two years, Callaway said his group has not only installed solar panels on roofs of affordable housing units, but also equipment capable of producing 2 megawatts of solar energy on shopping malls up in upstate New York. He emphasized that hiring locally would be most beneficial since local installers know the community and local regulations best. Related article Allergy season will start much earlier than normal and be far more intense because of climate crisis, study suggests “One of my huge concerns is social equity,” Cowen said. “Access to renewable energy is a fairly privileged position these days, and we’ve got to figure out ways to make that not true.” Jasmine Graham, WE ACT’s energy justice policy manager, said the potential of building rooftop solar on big box superstores is encouraging, only “if these projects use local labor, if they are paying prevailing wages, and if this solar is being used in a manner such as community solar, which would allow [utility] bill discounts for folks that live in the same utility zone.” Pressure is mounting for global leaders to act urgently on the climate crisis after a UN report in late February warned the window for action is rapidly closing. Neumann believes the US can meet its energy demand with renewables. All it takes, she said, is the political will to make that switch, and the inclusion of the local community so no one gets left behind in the transition. “The sooner we make that transition, the sooner we’ll have cleaner air, the sooner we’ll have a more protected environment and better health and the sooner we’ll have a more livable future for our kids,” Neumann said. “And even if that requires investment, it is an investment worth making.” CNN’s Judson Jones contributed to this report. © 2024 Cable News Network.

1,2024-08-02 07:37:00.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-02 05:16:08.000,Look of the Week: Blackpink headline Coachella in Korean hanboks,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/blackpink-coachella-2023-hanboks-lotw/index.html,2023-04-18 15:39:40.000,"Editor’s Note: Featuring the good, the bad and the ugly, ‘Look of the Week’ is a regular series dedicated to unpacking the most talked about outfit of the last seven days. Bringing the second day of this year’s Coachella to a close, K-Pop girl group Blackpink made history Saturday night when they became the first Asian act to ever headline the festival. To a crowd of, reportedly, over 125,000 people, Jennie, Jisoo, Lisa and Rosé used the ground-breaking moment to pay homage to Korean heritage by arriving onstage in hanboks: a traditional type of dress. While the garments were shrugged off a few seconds into their opening track, “Pink Venom,” revealing each member’s custom black and pink Dolce and Gabbana outfit, fans across the world had already received the message. Screenshots of the moment quickly spread among Blackpink superfans, otherwise known as Blinks. “The way they stepped onto the biggest western stage in hanboks … literally proved their place at the top of the industry,” tweeted one Blink. “Blackpink really are in a league of their own.” Another called the group “Korea’s cultural delegation” on Instagram, in reference to not only the hanboks but other visual cues incorporated into their show, such as one of the stage backdrops featuring an angular tiled roof reminiscent of traditional Korean architecture. Look of the Week: Are we about to see more men in tights? In recent years, Blackpink have enjoyed a meteoric rise to global fame. According to Guinness World Records, they are currently the most streamed female group on Spotify, and have the most-viewed music YouTube channel. Last year, they were the first female K-Pop group to reach number 1 in the UK and US album charts, and in 2020 their track “How You Like That” became the most viewed video on YouTube in 24 hours. (The group also wore modernized hanboks, designed by Kim Danha, in one of the music video’s scenes.) Their landmark set over the weekend was in fact a follow-up to another milestone: In 2019, they became the first female K-Pop group to ever play at Coachella or any other US festival. From the iconic Jean Paul Gaultier cone bra worn by Madonna for her 1990 Blond Ambition tour to Geri “Ginger Spice” Halliwell’s Union Jack mini dress, the right stage costume can live on forever in public memory. Particularly when worn at a career-defining moment. During another watershed Coachella performance — Beyonce’s 2018 headline set — the singer’s custom Balmain collegiate-style yellow hoodie was a joyful nod to Black culture, specifically historically Black colleagues and universities. The group’s four black hanboks were custom created by South Korean pattern design brand OUWR and traditional Korean dressmakers Kumdanje. Inspired by the Cheol-lik silhouette, each garment was hand-embroidered with metallic traditional Korean motifs, including dan-cheong patterns and peonies (a symbol of royalty in Korea). “It was our pleasure and such an honor to be able to show the beautiful values of Korea and Hanbok together,” the designers wrote in a combined Instagram post. “Blackpink showed the beauty of Korea and dazzled the world.” In Korea, hanboks are still worn for special occasions and often seen on TV dramas. Many designers in the country have also created contemporary takes that are incorporated into everyday wear. At Seoul Fashion Week, JULYCOLUMN’s Fall-Winter 2023 collection drew on the hanbok’s voluminous silhouette to create shirts and structured jackets. Last September, Korean label BlueTamburin brought the garment to a Western audience by exclusively using traditional hanbok fabric to create its Spring-Summer 2023 collection at Milan Fashion Week. Look of the Week: 'Barbie' stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling hit the road in bubblegum pink Whether you’re a devoted Blink or not, the looks marked a moment of Asian visibility, recognition of traditional craftsmanship and a powerful example of feeling seen through fashion — representing Korean culture and symbolically embracing both its past and future. At the end of their performance, and having addressed the audience between numbers in English throughout their two-hour-long performance, Blackpink finished their set in Korean: “Until now, it has been Jennie, Jisoo, Lisa, and Rosé Blackpink. Thank you.” Top image: Blackpink performing at the first weekend of Coachella 2023, shortly after removing their hanboks. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

1,2024-08-02 07:37:00.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-02 05:16:08.000,Scientists identify secret ingredient in Leonardo da Vinci paintings,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/old-masters-da-vinci-egg-yolk-painting-scn/index.html,2023-03-30 17:43:18.000,"Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. “Old Masters” such as Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli and Rembrandt may have used proteins, especially egg yolk, in their oil paintings, according to a new study. Trace quantities of protein residue have long been detected in classic oil paintings, though they were often ascribed to contamination. A new study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications found the inclusion was likely intentional — and sheds light on the technical knowledge of the Old Masters, the most skilled European painters of the 16th, 17th, or early 18th century, and the way they prepared their paints. Scientists confirm long held theory about what inspired Monet “There are very few written sources about this and no scientific work has been done before to investigate the subject in such depth,” said study author Ophélie Ranquet of the Institute of Mechanical Process Engineering and Mechanics at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany, in a phone interview. “Our results show that even with a very small amount of egg yolk, you can achieve an amazing change of properties in the oil paint, demonstrating how it might have been beneficial for the artists.” Simply adding some egg yolk to their works, it turns out, could have long-lasting effects that went beyond just aesthetics. Compared with the medium formulated by ancient Egyptians called tempera — which combines egg yolk with powdered pigments and water — oil paint creates more intense colors, allows for very smooth color transitions and dries far less quickly, so it can be used for several days after its preparation. However, oil paint, which uses linseed or safflower oil instead of water, also has drawbacks, including being more susceptible to color darkening and damage caused by exposure to light. Because making paint was an artisanal and experimental process, it is possible that the Old Masters might have added egg yolk, a familiar ingredient, to the newer type of paint, which first showed up in the seventh century in Central Asia before spreading to Northern Europe in the Middle Ages and Italy during the Renaissance. In the study, the researchers recreated the process of paint-making by using four ingredients — egg yolk, distilled water, linseed oil and pigment — to mix two historically popular and significant colors, lead white and ultramarine blue. “The addition of egg yolk is beneficial because it can tune the properties of these paints in a drastic way,” Ranquet said, “For example by showing aging differently: It takes a longer time for the paint to oxidize, because of the antioxidants contained in the yolk.” The chemical reactions between the oil, the pigment and the proteins in the yolk directly affect the paint’s behavior and viscosity. “For example, the lead white pigment is quite sensitive to humidity, but if you coat it with a protein layer, it makes it a lot more resistant to it, making the paint quite easy to apply,” Ranquet said. “On the other hand, if you wanted something stiffer without having to add a lot of pigment, with a bit of egg yolk you can create a high impasto paint,” she added, referring to a painting technique where the paint is laid out in a stroke thick enough that the brushstrokes are still visible. Using less pigment would have been desirable centuries ago, when certain pigments — such as lapis lazuli, which was used to make ultramarine blue — were more expensive than gold, according to Ranquet. A direct evidence of the effect of egg yolk in oil paint, or lack thereof, can be seen in Leonardo da Vinci’s “Madonna of the Carnation,” one of the paintings observed during the study. Currently on display at the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, Germany, the work shows evident wrinkling on the face of Mary and the child. “Oil paint starts to dry from the surface down, which is why it wrinkles,” Ranquet said. One reason for wrinkling may be an insufficient quantity of pigments in the paint, and the study has shown that this effect could be avoided with the addition of egg yolk: “That’s quite amazing because you have the same quantity of pigment in your paint, but the presence of the egg yolk changes everything.” Because wrinkling occurs within days, it’s likely that Leonardo and other Old Masters might have caught onto this particular effect, as well as additional beneficial properties of egg yolk in oil paint, including resistance to humidity. The “Madonna of Carnation” is one of Leonardo’s earliest paintings, created at a time when he might have been still trying to master the then newly popular medium of oil paint. Another painting observed during the study was “The Lamentation Over the Dead Christ,” by Botticelli, also on display at the Alte Pinakothek. The work is mostly made with tempera, but oil paint has been used for the background and some secondary elements. “We knew that some parts of the paintings show brushstrokes that are typical for what we call an oil painting, and yet we detected the presence of proteins,” Ranquet said. “Because it’s a very small quantity and they are difficult to detect, this might be dismissed as contamination: In workshops, artists used many different things, and maybe the eggs were just from the tempera.” However, because adding egg yolk had such desirable effects on oil paint, the presence of proteins in the work might be an indication of deliberate use instead, the study suggested. Ranquet hopes that these preliminary findings might attract more curiosity toward this understudied topic. DNA analysis of Beethoven's hair reveals health issues — and a family secret Maria Perla Colombini, a professor of analytical chemistry at the University of Pisa in Italy, who was not involved in the study, agreed. “This exciting paper provides a new scenario for the understanding of old painting techniques,” she said in an email. “The research group, reporting results from molecular level up to a macroscopic scale, contributes to a new knowledge in the use of egg yolk and oil binders. They are not more looking at simply identifying the materials used by Old Masters but explain how they could produce wonderful and glittering effects by employing and mixing the few available natural materials. They try to discover the secrets of old recipes of which little or nothing is written,” she added. “This new knowledge contributes not only to a better conservation and preservation of artworks but also to a better comprehension of art history.” Top image: The “Mona Lisa” by Leonardo Da Vinci © 2024 Cable News Network.

CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation. Hugh Hefner launched Playboy Magazine 70 years ago this year. The first issue included a nude photograph of Marilyn Monroe, which he had purchased and published without her knowledge or consent. Hefner went on to build the Playboy brand off the backs of the countless women featured in its pages, whose beauty and performance of heightened feminine sexuality have entertained its readers for generations. Approaching its 70th anniversary in December, Playboy has radically shifted. With the magazine no longer in publication, the Playboy Mansion sold to a developer and London’s last remaining Playboy Club closing in 2021, what is the future for Playboy? The brand is changing to keep up with the post-#MeToo world. Hefner passed away one month before allegations against film producer Harvey Weinstein surfaced in 2017 giving momentum to the #MeToo movement (which saw survivors of sexual assault and harassment speak out against their abusers). READ MORE: Sex, love and companionship … with AI? Why human-machine relationships could go mainstream In recent years, many have re-evaluated Hefner’s legacy and relationships with women. The 2022 docuseries “The Secrets of Playboy” (which aired on Channel 4 in the UK) detailed sexual misconduct accusations against Hefner from several ex-girlfriends, including model Sondra Theodore and TV personality Holly Madison. Hefner and Playboy’s relationship with women has been complicated. Playboy was an early supporter of abortion rights, helped fund the first rape kit and was at times an early proponent of inclusivity (for example featuring transgender model, Caroline “Tula” Cossey, in its June 1981 issue). But most women featured in Playboy have fit within a narrow beauty standard — thin, white, able-bodied and blonde. Meanwhile Hefner’s personal relationship with his much younger girlfriends reportedly followed patterns of control and emotional abuse. Ex-girlfriend Holly Madison described Hefner as treating her “like a glorified pet” in her 2015 memoir, “Down the Rabbit Hole.” Hefner’s passing meant he evaded reckoning with the #MeToo movement. Playboy, however, responded, releasing a statement in which it affirmed support for the women featured in “The Secrets of Playboy” and called Hefner’s actions “abhorrent.” The statement declared that the brand was no longer affiliated with the Hefner family and would be focusing on aspects of the company’s legacy that align with values of sex positivity and free expression. READ MORE: The ‘milf’: a brief cultural history, from Mrs Robinson to Stifler’s mom Today, Playboy is a very different company from the one Hefner launched nearly 70 years ago. Roughly 80% of Playboy staff identify as women, according the company, and its motto has changed from “Entertainment for Men” to “Pleasure for All.” Shares in the company are publicly traded and 40% of its board and management are women. The company has also moved towards more creator-led content through its app, Playboy Centerfold. Similar to subscription content service OnlyFans, Playboy Centerfold allows subscribers to view content from and interact with its creators, which it call “bunnies.” On the app, creators — or bunnies — are able portray their own bodies however they wish, putting the power back in their hands. Perhaps Playboy’s future is no longer in serving the male gaze, but instead the very audience Hefner dismissed in his first letter from the editor: “If you’re a man between the ages of 18 and 80 Playboy is meant for you … If you’re somebody’s sister, wife or mother-in-law and picked us up by mistake, please pass us along to the man in your life and get back to your Ladies Home Companion.” The stars of Playboy’s mid-2000s reality series, Holly Madison and Bridget Marquardt, are also enjoying a resurgence among fans. “The Girls Next Door” launched in 2004. The show focused on the lives of Hefner’s three girlfriends, Madison, Marquardt and Kendra Wilkinson. It became E’s best performing show and cultivated a new female audience for Playboy. “The Girls Next Door” was a story of complicated empowerment despite patriarchal interference. Its three female protagonists went from being known solely as some of Hefner’s many blonde girlfriends, to celebrities in their own right. They each ultimately broke up with Hefner, leaving the Mansion and going on to lead successful careers. The show’s depiction of Madison, Marquardt and Wilkinson as empowered, fun-loving and complex individuals, who found joy and agency through expressing their sexuality was perhaps what drew so many female fans to the show. However, amid the girls’ fight for agency, Hefner retaliated. The series shows that he maintained final say in every Playboy photograph of the girls, as well as imposing strict curfews and spending allowances. In Madison and Wilkinson’s memoirs, “Down the Rabbit Hole,” and “Sliding into Home,” they claim that production consistently undermined them. They refused to pay them for the first season, didn’t credit them until season four and aired their uncensored nude bodies in foreign broadcasts and DVD releases without consent. READ MORE: #MeToo in space: We must address the potential for sexual harassment and assault away from Earth Fan interest in “The Girls Next Door” remains strong. In August 2022 Madison and Marquardt launched their podcast “Girls Next Level,” where they interview previous playmates and interact with fans. They also recap episodes from their own points of view, unpacking their experiences of working on the show. Having reached 10 million downloads as of February 2023, the success of the podcast — 14 years after the last episode of “The Girls Next Door” — speaks to the cultural legacy of the Playboy brand. It also shows that despite Hefner’s original editor’s note, Playboy resonates with some women. Playboy is now in a post-Hefner era, where the imagery of women found within old issues of Playboy can serve as inspiration for others to enjoy their own sexuality. Whatever the future has for the company, the concept of Playboy has become public property — be that in the appearance of Playboy bunny costumes each Halloween, the popularity of cheeky Playboy logo tattoos or branded lingerie and clothing. In a post-#MeToo era, the women of Playboy are speaking up and taking over. With the mansion gates closed, the bunnies are finally reclaiming the brand as their own.

Inside fashion's worrying runway trend,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/fashion-week-fall-winter-2023-size-diversity-skinny-wegovy/index.html,2023-04-06 20:53:38.000,"Now that the Fall-Winter 2023 catwalks have been disassembled, it’s clear one trend was more pervasive than any collective penchant for ruffles, pleated skirts or tailored coats. Across runways in New York, London, Milan and Paris, there was a notable scarcity of plus-size models. This comes at a time when there are five injectable medications which can be used as appetite suppressants currently available by prescription in the US, stirring much conversation; a sixth medication, Rybelsus, is taken as an oral pill. Two are officially approved in the UK — the largest influx of weight loss medication seen in the country in almost a decade. Dior's landmark Mumbai show signals India's growing luxury status In recent months, injectables such as Wegovy and Ozempic — which share the same active ingredient, semaglutide — have been widely reported as Hollywood’s worst-kept weight loss secret. (Ozempic is intended for use primarily to treat Type 2 diabetes.) Comedian Chelsea Handler claimed her “anti-aging doctor just hands (Ozempic) out to anybody” while appearing on a podcast in January. Even Elon Musk tweeted last year about being on Wegovy. For many fashion commentators and diversity advocates, the Fall-Winter 2023 runways were in sharp contrast to the (albeit limited) progress and heady promise of recent seasons. This rollback has been widely criticized in the style media as such. And its potential impact is being assessed more broadly: With the rise of these weight loss panaceas, the pursuit of size zero is now just a prescription away. In 2020, Jill Kortleve and Paloma Elsesser became the first models outside of a sample size to walk for the Italian fashion house Fendi. (Traditionally, a sample size falls between a US 0-4.) British label Erdem entered the plus-size market in 2021, extending its offering to a UK size 22 (or US size 18). And in January 2022, Valentino made headlines after its haute couture show featured a broad spectrum of body types. But this season, there was a visible lack of curve bodies on their runways — or many others. Fendi and Valentino did not respond when contacted by CNN, while Erdem declined to comment. According to fashion search engine Tagwalk, the number of mid and plus-size models dropped by 24% in comparison to Spring-Summer 2023. Similarly, a size inclusivity report conducted by Vogue Business found that 95.6% of all looks presented for Fall-Winter 2023 were in a size US 0-4. For context, industry market firm Plunkett Research estimated in 2015 that 68% of American women wear a size US 14 or above. “It was a definitive backslide,” said IMG model agent Mina White, who represents plus-size and curve supermodels including Elsesser and Ashley Graham. “It was frustrating to see some of these designers not using curved bodies where they had in the past.” Fendi and Valentino did not respond when contacted by CNN, while Erdem declined to comment. “Watching somebody like Ashley Graham attend the front row for so many of these major houses in full looks (provided by the designer), it was frustrating,” White continued. “They wanted to utilize her image and her social following to command a certain space in the market, but they didn’t want to be reflective on their runways.” For others, even the term “backslide” was too generous. “Slipping back from… what? A glorious time when the average American woman (size 16) was as present on the runways as she is in everyday life? A time when fashion ads cast as many ‘plus-size’ and ‘mid-size’ women as ‘straight-size’ women?” fashion journalist Amy Odell wrote in her Substack newsletter of this past season’s runways. “No one needed any data to understand that representing a wide array of body shapes and sizes in runway shows or in fashion imagery is not a priority for the industry.” That said, a handful of — mostly smaller — brands pushed ahead this season. In London, emerging labels Di Petsa, Karoline Vitto and Sinead O’Dwyer showcased lineups of size-diverse models. Inclusivity at Christian Siriano, Coach, Kim Shui, Collina Strada and Bach Mai stood out in New York; while in Paris, Belgian brand Esther Manas — a consistent flag-bearer for size diversity — staged one of the city’s most refreshing runways with an assortment of fun, sensual, feminine looks that complimented a range of bodies. There was also a smattering of mid- and plus-size castings to be seen elsewhere: Off-White and Michael Kors, for example, featured a few such models. At Harris Reed’s debut for Nina Ricci, Precious Lee opened the show — which also featured three more plus- and mid-size models. Fashion samples and sample size pieces are one-off garments made before an item is mass-produced, typically to be worn during runway shows. Prioritizing the same body type in sample sizes means runway models are more easily interchangeable, saving fashion houses time and money if someone were to drop out or get sick during or after the casting process for a show. It’s also partly why, according to White, casting curve models is still an uphill battle. She says she introduces brands to new faces months in advance of runway season, with their specific measurements up-top and easy to read in all correspondence. “I want to be ahead of that,” White said. “So I’m never told ‘Oh, we wanted to make it work, but we didn’t have her size’ or whatever that conversation might look like.” Look of the Week: What Pope Francis' AI puffer coat says about the future of fashion But despite her efforts, she says she’s frequently told it’s too much of a “financial lift” to make larger samples — even by legacy brands. “I get very upset when brands say that,” White said. “I don’t believe that it is, I believe that it’s people not being properly educated on how to do this right.” Beyond the lack of representation, White notes it’s painful for plus-size consumers to watch brands leverage resources to create custom, made-to-fit pieces for celebrities — all the while claiming the pot is empty for more inclusive runway samples. London-based stylist and editor Francesca Burns agrees sample sizes are part of the problem. In 2020, Burns went viral after she posted on Instagram about a fashion job gone wrong. She says she was sent five looks to style from Celine, none of which fit the size UK 8 (US 4) model booked for the shoot— an 18-year-old on her first job in the business. The experience left her “horrified,” Burns told CNN, recalling what she saw as the model’s shame and embarrassment. “Looking into this girl’s eyes,” Burns said, “she shouldn’t have felt like that.” Burns’ post, which called the current system “unacceptable,” was picked up widely in the fashion media. (When reached by CNN, Celine declined to comment on the incident.) “Ultimately, the desire to see change has to be there,” Burns said. “And I wonder whether luxury has that desire?” Progress has been slow, but not entirely inexistent. Across fashion campaigns, magazine covers and editorial shoots, there is a growing enthusiasm for inclusivity. “I see the options rolling in for the plus-sized talent, and they’re great offerings,” said White. “Great, strong editorials and covers and campaigns. But I do feel like without the clothes, we are going to go back to see more naked curve stories, or lingerie curve stories or a curve girl in a trench coat. That’s what I don’t want.” For British Vogue’s April issue, unveiled March 16, Elsesser, Lee and Jill Kortleve were dubbed “The New Supers.” Preceding the cover story is a letter written by editor-in-chief, Edward Enninful commending the models for “leading the way” and holding “powerful space” in the industry. “Catwalks are once again under scrutiny for a stark lack of body diversity,” read the magazine’s Instagram caption, unveiling the cover. “But this cover was not conceived as a statement. It is a crowning of an all-powerful trio, the supermodels for a new generation.” But many online were quick to point out the disconnect: Two of the Saint Laurent Spring-Summer 2023 dresses were modeled by plus-size women, though they are not available to buy in most plus sizes. In his own social media post, Enninful wrote about his disappointment at the Fall-Winter 2023 runways. “I thought I had gotten into a time machine. Show after show dominated by one body type, so many limited visions of womanhood… one prescribed notion of beauty prevailed again, and it felt like the reality of so many women around the world were being ignored.” But for White, the power rests within the entire industry — not just at the feet of brands. “I really do believe there should be an industry standard between the (Council of Fashion Designers of America), the British Fashion Council and key editors at some of these major mass market magazines,” she continued. “If there was a call-to-action from these figureheads saying, moving forward samples need to be readily available for a few different body types, we would see significant and impactful change.” Burns agrees there must be a trickle-down effect. “I think a lot of responsibility is put on young designers to solve all these issues around sustainability or issues around body inclusivity,” she said. “It’s important that the big powerhouses, which have the capacity to action change, really take some responsibility.” On March 8, Wegovy — developed primarily as a treatment for those living with obesity and weight-related conditions — was approved in the UK. It’s the second injectable weight management medication to be made available with a prescription via the country’s National Health Service (NHS) in about 3 years, after almost a decade of quiet. Before 2020, the last weight loss medication was approved in the UK was in 2010. Similarly, the US has now approved three weight management injections: Wegovy, Saxenda and IMCIVREE. Medications for type-2 diabetes like Mounjaro and Ozempic are not FDA-approved for weight loss, though some doctors are issuing them at their own discretion. While these medicines are a revolutionary tool for those who struggle to lose weight for genetic or medical reasons, they are at risk of being abused. Semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic, was originally developed for treating type-2 diabetes. It quells hunger signals to the brain by mimicking the hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). “It can slow how quickly your stomach empties out and may give you a little more feeling of feeling full,” said Dr. Robert Lash, an endocrinologist and Chief Medical Officer of the Endocrine Society in Washington, D.C. In clinical trials, over a period of 68 weeks, participants who used the medication in conjunction with eating fewer calories and increasing their physical activity on average lost around 15% of their body weight compared to 2.4% of those using a placebo, according to the manufacturer Novo Nordisk. On March 13, the European Medicines Agency issued a statement warning of an Ozempic shortage that could continue through the year, urging doctors to prioritize prescriptions to diabetics. “Any other use, including for weight management, represents off-label use and currently places the availability of Ozempic for the indicated population at risk,” read the release. Patients typically need a BMI of 27 or higher (along with another weight-related condition like high blood pressure or diabetes) or have a genetic predisposition towards obesity to be prescribed such appetite suppressant medication by their doctor. But talk of these injectables has been sweeping the West. In January, the New York Times reported on the term “Ozempic Face,” coined by a New York-based dermatologist who reported treating several patients with a hollowed-out appearance that can come with rapid weight loss. By the end of February, the medication had made it to the cover of New York Magazine in a feature titled “Life After Food?” Adverts for GLP-1 injections are even blanketing New York City subway stations. And across social media, online forums and private group chats, some people looking to lose weight for primarily aesthetic purposes are searching for a way to skirt the requirements. “I was just looking for a way to lose a few pounds, like 10 to 15 at most,” said one 30-year-old American woman, who wished to remain anonymous, in a phone interview. She scoured social media and forums for guidance on securing a weight loss drug. “I’m certainly a normal BMI, I just have a trip to Mexico coming up and I want to look really good,” she said. Although she says she found a way to access Wegovy, she decided against the medication after considering the cost (which can reach more than $1,000 a month without insurance). “I’ve always very much fit the societal standard but lately I was just like f*ck it, I want to be skinny,” she told CNN. Dr. Lash emphasized the importance of taking weight loss drugs only with medical supervision and a valid prescription. “If somebody was a normal weight and they took this drug because they thought they could be even thinner than they are now, that could lead to complications,” he told CNN, warning of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and even gallbladder problems. “These drugs are not benign, they do have side effects involving the GI tract. There’s no such thing as a free lunch.” Fashion has long promoted size 0 as the ultimate virtue — regardless of its viability for many people, or any health risks. And now with the accessibility of accelerated weight loss medication, the stakes are even higher. For Burns and White, the industry is responsible for amplifying a new, more inclusive vision of beauty. “There’s a very archaic way of looking at women over a size 16 and just assuming that they’re unhealthy or uneducated or unstylish. Or don’t have the resources to buy into luxury,” said White. “The reality is the same women these brands are alienating in their fashion space are the same women running out to buy their handbags, shoes, perfumes, cosmetics and skincare.” Not only do designers need to create clothes with this consumer in mind, according to White, but they need to be seen on the runway, too. “It shouldn’t be a conversation. It should just be normalized that we’re not just looking at a single view of beauty,” echoed Burns. Ester Manas and Balthazar Delepierre, whose bridal-inspired Fall-Winter 2023 collection was one of this season’s most size-diverse runways, summarized it best in their accompanying show notes: “The body is not the subject. Because, obviously, at a wedding, everybody is invited. And all to the party. That is where the designer duo Ester and Balthazar take their stand.” © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

1,2024-08-02 07:37:00.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-02 05:16:08.000,Michael Jordan's 1998 NBA Finals sneakers sell for a record $2.2 million,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/michael-jordan-sneakers-1998-finals-sothebys-auction-record/index.html,2023-04-12 03:17:57.000,"Editor’s Note: This story was updated with the final sale price and other details following the auction. In 1998, Michael Jordan laced up a pair of his iconic black and red Air Jordan 13s to bring home a Bulls victory during Game 2 of his final NBA championship — and now they are the most expensive sneakers ever to sell at auction.The game-winning sneakers sold for $2.2 million at Sotheby’s in New York on Tuesday, smashing the sneaker auction record of $1.47 million, set in 2021 by a pair of Nike Air Ships that Jordan wore earlier in his career. Remember when Dennis Rodman put on a wedding dress and claimed to marry himself? The sale arrives during “Jordan Year” — a reference to the NBA star player’s iconic jersey number 23. In January, Air Jordan partnered with Sotheby’s to auction off 13 pairs of retro sneakers that were designed in memory of The Notorious B.I.G. All lots outsold their high estimates of $5,000 by multiples, with the highest selling for more than $32,000. Last year, Jordan’s Game 1 jersey, also from the 1998 finals, became the most expensive item of worn sports memorabilia to sell at auction when it fetched $10.1 million at a Sotheby’s sale. Jordan’s farewell run with the Chicago Bulls is often referred to as “The Last Dance,” after the title of an ESPN and Netflix documentary that chronicled the season. Jordan announced his (second) retirement weeks before the finals, leading to the six-game series against the Utah Jazz becoming the most-watched in NBA history, based on Nielsen TV ratings. (Jordan would later return from 2001 to 2003 to play with the Washington Wizards, but did not win another championship). “Michael Jordan game-worn sports memorabilia has proven time and time again to be the most elite and coveted items on the market,” said Brahm Wachter, Sotheby’s head of streetwear and modern collectables, in a press release prior to the sale. “However, items from his ‘Last Dance’ season are of a greater scale and magnitude as seen with our record-breaking sale of his Game 1 jersey in 2022.” The pair of sneakers sold Tuesday were worn during Game 2, in Salt Lake City, which the Bulls won 93-88 after losing Game 1, with Jordan scoring 37 points. They are the last pair of black and red Air Jordan 13s that Jordan ever wore on the court for an NBA game, a press release from Sotheby’s noted. 13 of the best menswear looks from Oscars history Following Game 2, Jordan signed and gifted the set of worn shoes to the ball boy in the visitor’s locker room, as he was known to do, according to Sotheby’s. The Air Jordan 13 sneakers starred in a sports memorabilia sale called “Victoriam,” which featured items worn by athletes including Tom Brady, Kobe Bryant and Roger Federer. Several other Jordan items were included in the two-part auction, with a game-worn 1998 Bulls jersey and a pair of 1985 Air Jordan 1s fetching $508,000 and $127,000 respectively. Other top lots included one of Kobe Bryant’s LA Lakers shooting shirts, which sold for over $406,000, and a soccer jersey, worn by the late Pelé on his debut for the New York Cosmos in 1975, that sold fetched over $177,000.

1,2024-08-02 07:37:00.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-02 05:16:08.000,The surreal facades of America's strip clubs,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/francois-prost-gentlemens-club/index.html,2023-03-06 14:13:40.000,"Some people travel the world in search of adventure, while others seek out natural wonders, cultural landmarks or culinary experiences. But French photographer François Prost was looking for something altogether different during his recent road trip across America: strip clubs. From Miami to Los Angeles, Prost’s latest book “Gentlemen’s Club” charts his route across the US via nearly 150 strip clubs with names like Pleasures, Temptations and Cookies N’ Cream. There isn’t a single nude woman to be seen, however, as Prost’s camera was exclusively trained on the buildings themselves — and specifically their often-colorful facades. Over the course of five weeks in 2019 he traversed over 6,000 miles, with the resulting photos capturing everything from the pastel hues of Florida’s Club Pink Pussycat to venues hiding in plain sight in the country’s more religious states. “I’d divide these venues into two types: One is very integrated into the public landscape, and one is a bit more hidden and dodgy,” Prost said, speaking to CNN on a video call and email. The first type, he added, could be found in “very American” settings, such as “around amusement parks and fast food and malls.” The latter venues, however, would sometimes look indistinguishable from any store in a strip mall. Prost said he found many such establishments along the Bible Belt, a socially conservative region in the country’s south. He was especially keen to explore the area due to the apparent contrast between the prevalence of strip clubs and what he describes in his book as “conservatism and extreme puritanism.” Prost insisted that he had little interest in the interiors or services of the strip clubs, which he always visited during the day. Instead, he hoped to learn more about American culture by creating objective, documentary-style photographs of establishments sitting at the intersection of sex, gender and commerce. Documenting changing attitudes toward sex through the lens of architecture, he added that the series was primarily of a landscape photography project. Artful photos inside Houston's ONYX strip club tell a story of beauty and confidence “The prism of this theme of strip club facades became a way of studying and trying to understand the country,” he wrote in “Gentlemen’s Club,” photographs from which will feature in an exhibition in Tokyo in March. ”(‘Gentlemen’s Club’ is) an objective panorama of dominant opinions and gender and the sexualization of the feminine image.” The genesis of Prost’s project dates back to his 2018 series, “After Party,” which focused on the flamboyant facades of French nightclubs. He said that people frequently commented that the buildings’ exteriors looked as though they had been ripped straight out of American cities, sparking the idea that he should visit the US and extend the project. As he meticulously planned his trip, he was struck not only by the sheer volume of strip clubs in America but that — unlike In Europe — they often demanded to be seen. Hot pink walls, gigantic nude silhouettes and even candy-cane-striped storefronts made no secret of the kind of entertainment provided inside. From Brutalist Boston to Modernist Palm Springs, America's most eye-catching city halls “A good example would be Las Vegas, where strip clubs are everywhere and their signs blink as much as a fast food (restaurant) or casino sign,” Prost said. Miami’s clubs were often painted in vivid, Wes Anderson-esque hues. Other photos show brightly covered venues contrasting with their sparse desert surroundings. If the establishments were open during the day, Prost would enter and ask for permission to take photos in order “to not look suspicious… and explain what my intentions were,” he said. The interiors rarely lived up to the tantalizing promises plastered across the signs outside, but the photographer met a host of characters during his five-week trip, from indifferent bouncers to managers who were thrilled about the project. “Most of the time, people were OK — 99% of them would say yes to a facade picture,” he said, adding they typically wouldn’t mind his presence, as long as he didn’t take photos of patrons or dancers. “Some would think that it was a bit strange, some would be really excited about it and give me their business card to send me the picture when it was done,” he said. Prost said his biggest surprise, however, was how “normalized” strip clubs appeared to be in everyday life. As he reflects in his book, “The relationship that Americans seem to have with strip clubs is quite different to what you see in Europe. Going to a strip club seems to be a lot more normalized … You go as a couple, or amongst friends at night to have fun.” Giant doughnuts and a shoe you can walk into: California's strangest buildings He was struck, for instance, by the fact that so many Las Vegas strip clubs doubled as restaurants — with many boasting happy hour deals, buffets and special discounts for truck drivers or construction workers. “I noticed a few strip clubs that would advertise being a strip club and steakhouse, so you could eat a big piece of meat (while) watching strippers. That is also something that seems very American to me,” he said, adding: “I heard from some people I met in Portland there are even strip clubs (that offer) vegan food.” The facades are littered with jokes like “My sex life is like the Sahara, 2 palms, no dates” and pun-based names like Booby Trap and Bottoms Up. Prost’s documentarian approach heightens the signs’ surreal comedy. But it also doubles as a neutral lens through which viewers can make up their own minds about the objectification of women. By honing in on the faceless dancing bodies of female silhouettes and the quintessential “girls girls girls” signs, “Gentleman’s Club” explores the commodification of women who are, in reality, completely absent in Prost’s works (an observation reflected in the book’s title, which is a phrase that crops up numerous times on signs throughout his photographs). The strip clubs he visited market women as things to be consumed, from the many food-themed names to an advertisement reading, “1,000’s of beautiful girls & three ugly ones.” For his next project, Prost plans to visit Japan to document the nation’s love hotels, which occupy a similar role as strip clubs in some parts of the US: open secrets in a conservative society. But the photographer believes the American establishments he visited say something unique about the country — something that is less about sexuality and more about the American dream. Museum of Sex to open new outpost in Miami What his project has shown him is, he said, this: “As long as you’re successful in terms of business, (it doesn’t matter) if your activity deals with sex.” “Gentlemen’s Club” will be exhibited at Agnes b. Galerie Boutique in Tokyo, Japan, between March 17 and April 15, 2023. The book, published by Fisheye Editions, is available now. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation. We all know the routine by heart: “Please ensure your seats are in the upright position, tray tables stowed, window shades are up, laptops are stored in the overhead bins and electronic devices are set to flight mode.” Now, the first four are reasonable, right? Window shades need to be up so we can see if there’s an emergency, such as fire. Tray tables need to be stowed and seats upright so we can get out of the row quickly. Laptops can become projectiles in an emergency, as the seat back pockets are not strong enough to contain them. And mobile phones need to be set to flight mode so they can’t cause an emergency for the airplane, right? Well, it depends whom you ask. Aviation navigation and communication relies on radio services, which has been coordinated to minimize interference since the 1920s. The digital technology currently in use is much more advanced than some of the older analog technologies we used even 60 years ago. Research has shown personal electronic devices can emit a signal within the same frequency band as the aircraft’s communications and navigation systems, creating what is known as electromagnetic interference. Half of the world's 10 busiest airports for 2022 are in one country But in 1992, the US Federal Aviation Authority and Boeing, in an independent study, investigated the use of electronic devices on aircraft interference and found no issues with computers or other personal electronic devices during non-critical phases of flight. (Takeoffs and landings are considered the critical phases.) The US Federal Communications Commission also began to create reserved frequency bandwidths for different uses – such as mobile phones and aircraft navigation and communications – so they do not interfere with one another. Governments around the globe developed the same strategies and policies to prevent interference problems with aviation. In the EU, electronic devices have been allowed to stay on since 2014. What's the safest seat on a plane? We asked an aviation expert Why then, with these global standards in place, has the aviation industry continued to ban the use of mobile phones? One of the problems lies with something you may not expect – ground interference. Wireless networks are connected by a series of towers; the networks could become overloaded if passengers flying over these ground networks are all using their phones. The number of passengers that flew in 2021 was over 2.2 billion, and that’s half of what the 2019 passenger numbers were. The wireless companies might have a point here. Of course, when it comes to mobile networks, the biggest change in recent years is the move to a new standard. Current 5G wireless networks – desirable for their higher speed data transfer – have caused concern for many within the aviation industry. Radio frequency bandwidth is limited, yet we are still trying to add more new devices to it. The aviation industry points out that the 5G wireless network bandwidth spectrum is remarkably close to the reserved aviation bandwidth spectrum, which may cause interference with navigation systems near airports that assist with landing the aircraft. Airport operators in Australia and the US have voiced aviation safety concerns linked to 5G rollout, however it appears to have rolled out without such problems in the European Union. Either way, it is prudent to limit mobile phone use on planes while issues around 5G are sorted out. Most airlines now provide customers with Wi-Fi services that are either pay-as-you-go or free. With new Wi-Fi technologies, passengers could theoretically use their mobile phones to make video calls with friends or clients in-flight. On a recent flight, I spoke with a cabin attendant and asked her opinion on phone use during flights. It would be an inconvenience for cabin crew to wait for passengers to finish their call to ask them if they would like any drinks or something to eat, she stated. On an airliner with 200+ passengers, in-flight service would take longer to complete if everyone was making phone calls. For me, the problem with in-flight use of phones is more about the social experience of having 200+ people on a plane, and all potentially talking at once. In a time when disruptive passenger behaviour, including “air rage”, is increasingly frequent, phone use in flight might be another trigger that changes the whole flight experience. Disruptive behaviours take on various forms, from noncompliance to safety requirements such as not wearing seat belts, verbal altercations with fellow passengers and cabin crew, to physical altercations with passengers and cabin crews – typically identified as air rage. In conclusion – in-flight use of phones does not currently impair the aircraft’s ability to operate. But cabin crews may prefer not to be delayed in providing in-flight service to all of the passengers – it’s a lot of people to serve. However, 5G technology is encroaching on the radio bandwidth of aircraft navigation systems; we’ll need more research to answer the 5G question regarding interference with aircraft navigation during landings. Remember that when we are discussing the two most critical phases of flight, takeoffs are optional – but landings are mandatory.

1,2024-08-02 07:37:00.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-02 05:16:08.000,"'I was up to my waist down a hippo's throat.' He survived, and here's his advice",https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/hippo-attack-avoid-survive-paul-templer/index.html,2023-04-12 12:44:43.000,"Paul Templer was living his best life. He was 28 and conducting tours in his native Zimbabwe, with a focus on photographic safaris. He had been away for a few years, including a stint in the British army. But he had returned to Africa’s bush country “and fell back in love with it. The wildlife, the flora, the fauna, the great outdoors, the space – just everything about it. I was at home.” Templer said Zimbabwe’s guide certification program was rigorous, and there was a lot of pride among the guides who passed. He reveled in showing tourists the area’s majestic wildlife – including the water-loving, very territorial hippos. “It was idyllic,” he told CNN Travel. “Life was really, really good – until one day I had a really bad day at the office.” March 9, 1996. A Saturday. Templer learned a good friend who was to lead a canoe safari down the Zambezi River had malaria. He agreed to take his pal’s place. “I loved that stretch of the river. It was an area I know like the back of my hand.” The expedition consisted of six safari clients (four Air France crewmembers and a couple from Germany), three apprentice guides plus Templer. They had three canoes – clients in the first two seats and a guide in the back. Then one apprentice guide was in a one-person safety kayak. And down the famed Zambezi they went. “Things were going the way they were supposed to go. Everyone was having a pretty good time.” Eventually, they came across a pod of about a dozen hippos. That’s not unexpected on the Zambezi, Africa’s fourth-longest river. They weren’t alarmed at first as they were at a safe distance. But “we were getting closer, and I was trying to take evasive action. … The idea was let’s just paddle safely around the hippos.” Templer’s canoe led the way, with the other two canoes and kayak to follow. He pulled into a little channel waiting on the others. But the third canoe had fallen back from the group and was off the planned course. Templer’s not sure how that happened. Suddenly, there’s this big thud. And I see the canoe, like the back of it, catapulted up into the air. Paul Templer “Suddenly, there’s this big thud. And I see the canoe, like the back of it, catapulted up into the air. And Evans, the guide in the back of the canoe, catapulted out of the canoe.” The clients managed to remain in the canoe somehow. “Evans is in the water, and the current is washing Evans toward a mama hippo and her calf 150 meters [490 feet] away. … So I know I’ve got to get him out quickly. I don’t have time to drop my clients off.” He yells to Ben, one of the other guides, to retrieve the clients who were in the canoe that had been attacked. Ben got the clients to safety on a rock in the middle of the river that hippos couldn’t climb. Meanwhile, Templer turned his canoe around to get Evans. The plan was to pull alongside of him and pull him into Templer’s canoe. “I was paddling towards him … getting closer, and I saw this bow wave coming towards me. If you’ve ever seen any of those old movies with a torpedo coming toward a ship, it was kind of like that. I knew it was either a hippo or a really large crocodile coming at me,” he said. “But I also knew that if I slapped the blade of my paddle on water … that’s really loud. And the percussion underwater seems to turn the animals away,” he said. “So I slapped the water, and as it was supposed to do, the torpedo wave stops.” He was getting closer to Evans, but they were also getting closer to the female and calf. “I’m leaning over – it’s kind of a made-for-Hollywood movie – Evans is reaching up. … Our fingers almost touched. And then the water between us just erupted. Happened so fast I didn’t see a thing.” What happened next was nightmarish and surreal. “My world went dark and strangely quiet.” Templer said it took a few seconds to figure out what was going on. “From the waist down, I could feel the water. I could feel I was wet in the river. From my waist up, it was different. I was warm, and it wasn’t wet like the river, but it wasn’t dry either. And it was just incredible pressure on my lower back. I tried to move around; I couldn’t. “I realized I was up to my waist down a hippo’s throat.” There’s a good reason a fully grown hippopotamus can fit a large portion of a fully grown adult in its mouth. Hippos can grow up to 16.5 feet long (5 meters), 5.2 feet tall (1.6 meters) and weigh up to 4.5 tons (4 metric tonnes), according to National Geographic. They sport enormous mouths and can open their strong jaws to 150 degrees. Their teeth might be the most frightening thing of all. Their molars are used for eating plants, but their sharp canines, which might reach 20 inches (51 centimeters), are for defense and fighting. Their bite is almost three times stronger than that of a lion. One bite from a hippo can possibly cut a human body in half. They’re found naturally in various parts sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in East and Southern Africa, living in or near rivers and other water sources. (And they are an invasive species in Colombia thanks to escapees from drug lord Pablo Escobar’s menagerie). Hippos are very territorial and might aggressively attack any animal encroaching on their territory, including hyenas, lions and crocodiles. They also kill people. That we know for sure. Many internet sources say around 500 a year, but an exact figure is still uncertain because some attacks and deaths come in very remote regions and don’t get reported. “The question I get asked the most when people find out I study hippos is: ‘Is it true hippos kill more people than any animal?’ Rebecca Lewison, conservation ecologist and associate professor at San Diego State University, told CNN Travel in an email interview. How to survive a cobra bite -- or better yet, avoid one entirely “I’m not entirely sure where that started but … there is no authority or reliable data. People are surprised that hippos kill people. They look slow, and they are mostly in water. There are some nonfatal interactions, but people (or hippos) tend to fare badly from interactions.” Dr. Philip Muruthi, chief scientist and vice president of species conservation and science of the African Wildlife Foundation, said the AWF doesn’t have a credible source on the number of attacks or fatalities either. While more stats need to be collected, one study found that the probability of being killed by a hippopotamus attack is in the range of 29% to 87% – higher than that of a grizzly bear attack at 4.8%, shark attack at 22.7% and crocodile attack at 25%. Those were rather bad odds of survival working against Templer. “I’m guessing I was wedged so far down its throat it must have been uncomfortable because he spat me out. So I burst to the surface, sucked a lungful of fresh air and I came face to face with Evans, the guide who I was trying to rescue. And I said, ‘We got to get out of here!’ ” So once again, I’m up to my waist down the hippo’s throat. But this time, my legs are trapped but my hands are free. Paul Templer But Evans was in serious trouble. Templer started swimming back for him “and I was just moving in for your classic lifesaver’s hold when – WHAM! – I got hit from below. So once again, I’m up to my waist down the hippo’s throat. But this time my legs are trapped but my hands are free.” He tried to go for his gun, but he was being thrashed around so much he couldn’t grab it. The hippo – which turned out to be an older, aggressive male – spat Templer out a second time. “This time when I come to the surface I look around, there’s no sign of Evans.” Templer assumed Evans had been rescued, and he tried to escape himself. “I’m making pretty good progress and I’m swimming along there and I come up for the stroke and swimming freestyle and I look under my arm – and until my dying day I’ll remember this – there’s this hippo charging in towards me with his mouth wide open bearing in before he scores a direct hit.” This time, Templer was sideways in the hippo’s mouth, legs dangling out one side of the mouth, shoulders and head on the other side of its mouth. “And then he just goes berserk. … When hippos are fighting, the way they fight is they try to tear apart and just destroy whatever it is they’re attacking,” Templer said. “For me, fortunately everything was happening in slow motion. So when he’d go under water, I’d hold my breath. When we were on the surface, I would take a deep breath and I would try to hold onto tusks that were boring through me” to stop from being ripped apart. Templer said one of the clients watching the horror later described it like a “vicious dog trying to rip apart a rag doll.” He figures the whole attack took about three and a half minutes. Meanwhile, apprentice guide Mack in the safety kayak – “showing incredible bravery, risking his life to save mine – pulls his boat in inches from my face.” Templer managed to grab a handle on the kayak, and “Mack dragged me to the relative safety of this rock.” The expedition was still in one hell of a mess, though. People living near hippo territory are more likely victims of attacks than tourists, said Lewison. “Most of the attacks happen in the water, but because hippos raid crops on farms, there are also attacks on people trying to protect their crops. There are some tourists, but largely the attacks are happening to local residents,” Lewison said. Human encroachment from Africa’s booming population makes matters worse, increasing the chances of deadly interactions, she said. You encounter a bear in the wild. Do you know what to do next? Despite the encounters gone bad, sub-Saharan Africa depends on hippos. “Hippos are important ecosystem engineers of the ecology of freshwater areas they inhabit. This is through nutrient recycling from dung (they consume large amounts of vegetation),” Muruthi said. “Hippos attack not to eat people, but to get them the hell away from them,” Lewison said. “I don’t think hippos are particularly aggressive, but I think when under pressure, they attack.” Back on the rock in the Zambezi, Templer asked Mack where Evans was. Mack said, “He’s gone, man, he’s just gone.” Templer knew he needed to come up with a plan to get them off the rock and to the riverbank, but “first I needed to settle myself down.” He assessed the situation: One man missing. The first aid kit, radio and gun all gone. Six scared clients, two canoes and one paddle left. And his own body was shattered. “My left foot was especially bad; it looked as if someone had tried to beat a hole through it with a hammer.” He couldn’t move his arms. One arm from elbow down was “crushed to a pulp.” Blood was bubbling out of his mouth. They realized his lung was punctured. Mack rolled Templer over and could see a gaping hole in his back and plugged it with Saran Wrap from a plate of snacks. Templer made the call: No matter the risk, they had to get off that rock. He was loaded into a canoe. Ben paddled. The hippo kept bumping the canoe. He went from being terrified to calm on that ride back. He described “a profound spiritual experience in which I had this incredible sense of peace and realization this was my moment of choice. Like do I go, or do I stay? Do I close my eyes and drift off, or do I fight my way through this and stick around?” It was so intense I thought I was going to die, and when I didn’t, I kind of wished I would. Paul Templer on the pain after the attack “I chose to stick around, and as soon as I made that choice, it was more pain than I could ever imagine I could endure. It was so intense I thought I was going to die, and when I didn’t, I kind of wished I would.” Ben and Templer made it out of the river, but without finding Evans. His body was found three days later. They concluded he had drowned because he didn’t have any signs of animal attack on him. “Evans did nothing wrong. The fact that he died was purely a tragedy.” Meanwhile, some people on shore had realized something was wrong in the river. A well-trained Zimbabwe rescue team was able to safely ferry everyone else off the rock. “And that was my bad day at the office.” Templer was out of the river but not out of the woods. It took eight hours to drive him to the nearest hospital. In a month’s time, he had several major surgeries. He thought he would lose one leg and both arms. His surgeon didn’t think he’d live. But not only did the surgeon save Templer’s life, he saved his legs and one arm. The other arm, however, was beyond salvation. If you're attacked by an alligator, here's how to fight for your life He realized that in the ICU when he woke up and was feeling for his left hand. It was gone. “I just remember feeling devastated. I spent my whole life being active and it was almost more than I could bare.” But then he was flooded with relief to realize his right arm and legs had been saved. For the next month, he was “emotionally all over the map.” He got physical and occupational therapy in Zimbabwe and then more in the United Kingdom. He got a prosthesis “and then just started trying to get back to life.” Templer, Muruthi and Lewison all say safe outings start with education – and avoiding trouble in the first place. “Hippos have no interest in dealing with people. Stay away from them, and they will leave you alone. They are not hunting humans,” Lewison said. “Do not get close to them,” Muruthi said. “They don’t want any intrusion. … They’re not predators; it’s by accident if they’re injuring people.” Want close-up views and photos of the creatures? Instead of venturing too close, invest in good binoculars and telephoto camera lenses. Follow the rules. If you are a tourist, and it says ‘Stay in your vehicle,’ then stay in your vehicle. Philip Muruthi on avoiding hippo attacks Do not walk along well-worn hippo paths, stay close to your group and don’t approach them from behind, Muruthi said. “Follow the rules. If you are a tourist, and it says ‘Stay in your vehicle,’ then stay in your vehicle. And even when you’re in your vehicle, don’t drive it right to the animal.” Muruthi also advised that your party make some noise in areas known for hippos. “It’s good for them to know you’re around.” “Hippos usually come out of water late in the evening and at night to forage, so avoid trekking along the river at that time,” Muruthi said. Also stay on high alert during the dry season when food is scarce. Get to know the signs of disturbed hippos, Muruthi advised, in case you wander too closely. An agitated one will open its mouth wide and yawn as aggressive display. Also watch for a head thrown back, shaking of the head, grunting and snorting. “These are signs you should have left already!” Muruthi said. If you’ve attracted unwanted attention, Muruthi said to always remember you cannot outrun a hippo. They may look sluggish, but they can run 30 mph (almost 43 kph). Instead, you should try to climb a tree or find an obstacle to put between you and the hippo such as a rock or anthill. Muruthi, Lewison and Templer all said never stay between a hippo and the water. If it’s charging you, run parallel to the water source. As with so many other protective female animals, never get between a mama hippo and her young, Templer said. He was alone, deep in the moutains. And a rattlesnake just bit him. What if you’re in a small watercraft? “Typically, if a hippo is going to be attacking, you’ll see it coming way before. There will be that bow wave. … If you slap the water, the percussion 99.9 times out of 100 will turn the hippo,” Templer said. “If you’re in a canoe and a hippo knocks you in the water, get away from the canoe. The hippo is going for this big shape, getting it off its territory.” It’s also safer to view hippos on the water in a larger vessel, which the animal would have a harder time capsizing, Muruthi said. Unlike attacks by some other wild animals, humans are almost defenseless once an attack by a large hippo begins. “Once attacked, there is nothing you can do,” Muruthi said. “Fight for dear life and watch for any chance to escape.” He said you could try to poke at the eyes or any spot that might inflict unexpected pain. But given the size just of a hippo head, even that’s a tall order. Hippos typically hole punch you, so there isn’t much you can do if they get hold of you. Rebecca Lewison “Hippos typically hole punch you, so there isn’t much you can do if they get hold of you,” Lewison said. Based on his attack, Templer said try not to panic “when dragged underwater. Remember to suck in air if on the surface.” Another hippo attack survivor in this National Geographic video also was able to conserve her breath. She also grabbed the hippo’s snout, and one expert in the video theorizes that might have startled the hippo into letting her go. Two years after that attack, Templer said that he and a team made the longest recorded descent of the Zambezi River to date. It took three months and covered 1,600 miles (2,575 kilometers). How did Templer find the resilience to reclaim his life? After a particularly rough day trying to maneuver in a wheelchair, he said that his surgeon told him: “You’re the sum of your choices. You’re exactly who, what and where you choose to be in life.” Templer said he focused on what’s possible vs. what he’s lost. “If you look for what’s possible, it generally is.” Templer later moved to United States; got married to the sister of a journalist on the record-setting Zambezi trip; wrote the book “What’s Left of Me”; and is a speaker. Should people be afraid to even go on safari – especially in hippo areas – after learning of a harrowing story like Templer’s? Muruthi said go, but go smartly. Be sure to get advice from professional tour guides – and then follow their guidance, Muruthi said. “In Kenya, for example, contact the Kenya Professional Safari Guides Association,” he said. Templer said his attack was an “anomaly,” and he doesn’t want anyone to be dissuaded by what happened on his 1996 river run. “My biggest counsel would be: Absolutely go and do it. But hook yourself up with someone who knows what they’re doing out there. But by all means, go out … and experience it.” © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Get the latest news in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments. He’d spent years backpacking around the world, and Japanese traveler Daisuke Kajiyama was finally ready to return home to pursue his long-held dream of opening up a guesthouse. In 2011, Kajiyama arrived back in Japan with his Israeli partner Hila, who he met in Nepal, and the pair set about finding the perfect location for their future venture. However, there were a couple of major stumbling blocks in their way. To start with, Kajiyama had very little money to speak of after years of globetrotting around destinations like Korea, Taiwan, India, Nepal, Guatemala, Cuba and Canada. He also happened to have his heart set on a traditional Japanese house, typically known as kominka, which are usually passed down over generations. “I wanted to have a traditional house in the countryside,” Kajiyama tells CNN Travel, explaining that he was determined to find two houses located next to each other, so that he and Hila could live in one, while the other would be a guesthouse that they’d run together. “I had a vision.” This US couple bought and renovated a 14th-century Italian home When he was unable to find anything that met his requirements, Kajiyama decided to shift his search to include the growing number of abandoned homes in the country. As younger people ditch rural areas in pursuit of jobs in the city, Japan’s countryside is becoming filled with “ghost” houses, or “akiya.” According to the Japan Policy Forum, there were 61 million houses and 52 million households in Japan in 2013, and with the country’s population expected to decline from 127 million to about 88 million by 2065, this number is likely to increase. Kajiyama was driving around Tamatori, a small village located in the Shizuoka prefecture, between Kyoto and Tokyo, surrounded by green tea plantations and rice fields, when he came across an elderly woman farming, and decided to approach her. “I said ‘Do you know if there are any empty houses around here?’ And she just pointed,” he recalls. He looked over at the area that she was signaling to and spotted two neglected houses side by side – a former green tea factory and an old farmer’s home – located close to a river. Both properties had been uninhabited for at least seven years and needed a huge amount of work. Kajiyama asked the woman to contact the owner to find out if they’d be interested in selling. “The owner said that no one could live there, as it was abandoned,” he says. “But he didn’t say ‘no.’ Everybody was always saying ‘no.’ But he didn’t. So I felt there was a small chance.” Expats buy Japanese country house for a song and get way more than they bargained for Kajiyama returned to visit the houses around five times, before going to visit the owner himself to negotiate an agreement that would see him use the old green tree factory as a home, and convert the farmer’s house into the guesthouse he’d always envisioned. While he was keen to purchase both of the homes, he explains that the traditions around home ownership in Japan mean that he is unable to do so until it’s passed down to the son of the current owner. “They said ‘if you take all the responsibility yourself, you can take it.’ So we made an agreement on paper,” he says. Both he and Hila were aware that they had a lot of work ahead of them, but the couple, who married in 2013, were thrilled to be one step closer to having their own guesthouse in an ideal spot. “It’s a very nice location,” says Kajiyama. “It’s close to the city, but it’s really countryside. Also people still live here and go to work [in the city]. “The house is also in front of the river, so when you go to sleep you can hear the sound of the water.” According to Kajiyama, the process of clearing the house, which is around 90 years old, before beginning the renovation works was one of the hardest parts of the process, simply because there was so much stuff to sort through. However, he was able to repurpose some of the items. During the first year, he spent a lot of time connecting with locals, gaining knowledge about the home, and helping the local farmers with farming for the first year or so. Although he wasn’t hugely experienced with renovation work, he had spent some time farming and completing building while he was backpacking, and had also taken odd jobs fixing peoples homes. He completed much of the work on the guesthouse himself, replacing the floors and adding in a toilet, which he says was a wedding present from his parents, at a cost of around $10,000. “I’m not really a professional,” he says.” I like to do carpentry and I enjoy creating things, but I have no experience in my background. “From my several years of backpacking, I saw so many interesting buildings, so many houses of interesting shapes and I’ve been collecting those in my brain.” Kajiyama was determined to keep the house as authentic as possible by using traditional materials. He saved money by collecting traditional wood from building companies who were in the process of breaking down traditional houses. “They need to spend the money to throw it away,” he explains. “But for me, some of the stuff is like treasure. So I would go and take the material that I wanted. “The house is a very, very old style,” he says. “So it wouldn’t look nice if I brought in more modern materials. It’s totally authentic.” He explains that very little work had previously been done to the house, which is quite unusual for a home built so many years ago. “It’s totally authentic,” he says. “Usually, with traditional houses, some renovations are made to the walls, because the insulation is not so strong. So you lose the style.” He says he received some financial support from the government, which meant he was able to bring in a carpenter and also benefited from Japan’s working holiday program, which allows travelers to work in exchange for food and board, when he needed extra help. After doing some research into Japanese guesthouse permits, he discovered that one of the simplest ways to acquire one would be to register the property as an agriculture guesthouse. As the area is filled with bamboo forests, this seemed like a no-brainer, and Kajiyama decided to learn everything he could about bamboo farming so that he could combine the two businesses. “This is how I started farming,” he says. In 2014, two years after they began working on the house, the couple were finally able to welcome their first guests. “It was a beautiful feeling,” says Kajiyama. “Of course, this was my dream. But people really appreciate that it was abandoned and I brought it back to life.” He says that hosting guests from all over the world has helped him to stay connected to his former life as a backpacker. “I stay in one place, but people come to me and I feel like I’m traveling,” he says. “Today, it’s Australia, tomorrow it’s the UK and next week South Africa and India. “People come from different places and they invite me to join them for dinner, so sometimes I join someone’s family life.” Sadly, Hila passed away from cancer in 2022. Kajiyama stresses that his beloved wife played a huge part in helping him achieve his dream of having a guesthouse and says he couldn’t have done it without her. “We were really together,” he adds. “She created this place with me. Without her it would not have been like this.” While the three-bedroom guesthouse, which measures around 80 square meters, has been open for around eight years, Kajiyama is still working on it, and says he has no idea when he’ll be finished. “It’s never ending,” he admits. “I’m halfway, I feel. It is beautiful already. But it started off abandoned, so it needs more details. And I’m getting better at creating, so I need time to do it.” He explains that he’s unable to complete work on the home while guests are there. And while the property is closed during the winter, he spends two months as a bamboo farmer and usually spends a month traveling, which doesn’t leave him much time for renovations. “Sometimes I don’t do anything,” he admits. Yui Valley, which offers activities such as bamboo weaving workshops, has helped to bring many travelers to the village of Tamatori over the years. “Most of the guests come after Tokyo, and it’s such a contrast,” he says. “They are really happy to share the nature and the tradition in our house. “Most people have dreamed of coming to Japan for a long time and they have a very short time here. “So they have such a beautiful energy. I’m happy to host in this way and join their holiday time. It’s very special [for me].” Kajiyama estimates that he’s spent around $40,000 on the renovation work so far, and if the feedback from guests, and locals, is anything to go by, it seems to have been money well spent. “People appreciate what I’ve done,” he adds. “So that makes me feel special.” As for Hiroko, the woman who pointed out the house to him over a decade ago, Kajiyama says she’s stunned at the transformation, and is amazed at how many international travelers are coming to Tamatori to stay at Yui Valley. “She cannot believe how much more beautiful it is [now],” he says. “She didn’t think it was going to be like this. So she really appreciates it. She says ‘thank you’ a lot.” Yui Valley, 1170 Okabecho Tamatori, Fujieda, Shizuoka 421-1101, Japan © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Here are 10 reasons travelers should start planning their long-dreamed-of Mongolia visit now. With the government of Mongolia declaring 2023 through 2025 the “Years to Visit Mongolia,” citizens from an additional 34 countries can now visit the country visa-free through the end of 2025. The addition of several European countries, including Denmark, France, Greece, Italy, Norway, Spain, and the UK, as well as Australia and New Zealand, now brings the total number of countries and territories on the visa-exempt list to 61. The full list is here. After years of delays, a pandemic and several controversies, the newly built Chinggis Khaan International Airport finally opened in the summer of 2021. With the ability to handle approximately 3 million passengers a year (double that of the old airport), the addition of 500 new aircraft parking spaces and the infrastructure to support an increase in domestic as well as budget flights, the airport is a welcome addition to the country’s efforts to grow tourism. Budget flights to Hong Kong from EZNIS Airways have been relaunched since the airport’s opening, and talks to resume direct flights to the United States are reportedly underway. The recently opened Chinggis Khaan Museum offers a beautiful, fresh look at Mongolia’s tumultuous history. With more than 10,000 artifacts spanning over 2,000 years, the museum explores the history of the Mongols and the empire they created – and eventually lost. The museum’s artifacts are presented over eight floors, with six permanent and two temporary exhibition halls. Guided tours are offered in English every Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. free of charge. When most people think of Mongolia, music festivals and conservation-focused art installations in the heart of one of the world’s largest deserts are the last things to come to mind. But that’s all changing thanks to festivals like Playtime, Spirit of Gobi, INTRO Electronic Music Festival and the Kharkhorum 360 Visual Art & Music Experience. Placing international bands, DJs, and musicians from around the world alongside Mongolia’s eclectic mix of rappers, bands and folk singers, the country just might be one of the world’s most underrated places for festival lovers. The annual Naadam event has always been a great reason to visit Mongolia, but now that the festival has just celebrated its 100 year anniversary, 2023 is as good a time as ever to attend. While the festival’s origins are rooted in the days of Genghis Khan, when he used horse racing, wrestling and archery competitions to keep his warriors in shape between battles, Naadam only officially became a national holiday 100 years ago. Today, the festival – held in Ulaanbaatar at the National Sports Stadium, has a few more bells and whistles than it did during the days of the Great Khan. A seat at July 11’s opening ceremony is always one of the hardest tickets to score in town. Mounted archery is seeing a resurgence in Mongolia thanks to guys like Altankhuyag Nergui, one of the most accomplished archers in the sport and his archery academy, Namnaa. Here, locals learn the fundamentals of Mongolian archery before mounting a horse and taking their new found skills to another level. In the summer months, students and academy members put on weekly shows for interested spectators. The academy also offers day-long training sessions for those wanting to try this intense sport. Speaking of giving life to Mongolia’s most ancient traditions, the resurrection of Mongol bichig, or the traditional Mongolian script written from top to bottom and read from left to right, has also seen a major resurgence in recent years. Visit the Erdenesiin Khuree Mongolian Calligraphy Center in Karakorum to learn from master calligraphist Tamir Samandbadraa Purev about this important cultural heritage. And, while you’re there, browse the yurts filled with Tamir’s works. Pair the release of Husqvarna’s new Norden 901 Expedition motorbike with Nomadic Off-Road’s newly announced Eagle Hunter Tour, and you have one of the fastest adventures in Mongolia. The tour takes six riders 1,700 kilometers from Ulaanbaatar to Bayan-Ulgii, where riders eventually meet their hosts, Mongolia’s famous eagle hunters. The only thing faster than this adventure is the rate at which Nomadic Off-Road’s tours sell out. Capturing the art of the last eagle hunters of Mongolia Professional musher Joel Rauzy has been leading dogsledding tours across the frozen Lake Khuvsgul for 18 years. With fewer crowds, lower hotel rates and the chance to see one of the largest freshwater lakes in the world completely frozen over, winter in Mongolia is something else to see and experience. Rauzy’s company, Wind of Mongolia, offers tours of the lake, where each person is assigned their own sled and dogs for the journey. Following Rauzy’s lead, mushers will make a loop of the lake. Activities include ice fishing, while travelers stay in winterized yurts and spend time with nomadic families along the journey. Nestled in the heart of Selenge province on the Yeruu River, Yeruu Lodge is the brainchild of Norwegian founder Eirik Gulsrud Johnsen, who first visited Mongolia in 2017. With a minimal Scandinavian-style restaurant and dining area, a handful of fully kitted out yurts for guests to stay in, two pétanque courts, kayaks, a driving range, mountain bikes and a yoga area, the lodge is a destination for nature lovers. Completely off-grid, the lodge runs off solar panels, uses of thermal heating, and all of the property’s water comes from an on-property well and is recycled after use. Additionally, all glass, metal and plastic used at the lodge is also recycled, and food waste is turned into compost used to grow vegetables, berries and herbs onsite. The lodge is set to open in April 2023. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved. CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."
1,2024-08-02 07:37:00.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-02 05:16:08.000,The most beautiful sections of China's Great Wall,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/china-beautiful-great-wall-sections-cmd/index.html,2023-09-18 02:57:08.000,"Editor’s Note: Monthly Ticket is a CNN Travel series that spotlights some of the most fascinating topics in the travel world. In September, we’re celebrating superlatives as we look at some of the world’s biggest, tallest and most expensive attractions and destinations. Having lived in Beijing for almost 12 years, I’ve had plenty of time to travel widely in China. I’ve visited more than 100 cities, not to mention countless towns and villages throughout the mainland’s 31 provinces. Looking back, I’ve come to realize it was my frequent visits to different parts of the Great Wall in Beijing that were a driving force behind my desire to explore the rest of the country and, along with it, the many sections of wall that lie outside the capital’s boundaries. Work on the Great Wall began more than 2,500 years ago, its origins dating back to China’s Spring and Autumn Period of around 770 BCE to 476 BCE. Various sections were added in subsequent eras as competing dynasties and factions sought to exert their control. Work eventually stopped in the 17th century. What's it like to walk the entire length of China's Great Wall? Though not a single, unbroken structure, the wall spans over 21,000 kilometers, winding through 15 provinces, 97 prefectures and 404 counties. And while certain sections have been incredibly popular among tourists, many parts have slipped into obscurity, disrepair and sometimes oblivion. Whether you’re planning to visit the Great Wall for the first time or the 50th, the following destinations are sure to make your trip to China even more worthwhile. (Check out the above video for dramatic aerial footage of some of these amazing sites.) The Great Wall is not simply a brick and mortar bulwark; in certain places, towers on jagged mountain peaks, fortress towns or even wide rivers count as sections of “wall.” The Turtle City, built in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) as part of the Great Wall’s “Yellow River Defense Line,” was completed in 1608 and was home to around 2,000 infantrymen and 500 cavalry units during peak use. Today, this fortress city is located in the Sitan Township of Jingtai County in north central Gansu province. While there aren’t many real turtles in the “Turtle City,” the garrison town got its nickname due to its unique shape. The south gate acts as the head and the west and east gates as the flippers. The town’s oval wall is the body, while the north gate acts as its tail. As one of the most well-preserved and truly authentic walled cities left in China today, it’s definitely worth your time. Staying in the Jingtai County center is recommended. The ancient city is only a 30-minute cab ride from your lodgings, so you can visit whenever the light is best for photos. When in Jingtai, try local specialties such as the five Buddha tofu and the Jingtai cold mixed noodles – both are spicy vegetarian dishes. A walk through the sprawling night market in Jingtai County People’s Square, which boasts more than 50 snack stalls, is also recommended for adventurous foodies. Regional Chinese food: 8 lesser-known cuisines worth trying Getting there: Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu province, has a major international airport and high-speed train connections from many cities in China. The drive to Yongtai Turtle City from downtown Lanzhou takes about 2.5 hours (195 kilometers). From Lanzhou Zhongchuan Airport, it’s only 1.5 hours (125 kilometers). Mutianyu and Jiankou are two parts of the same Stone Dragon – two contiguous sections of the Great Wall that together stretch for roughly 25 kilometers along Beijing’s mountaintops. Historical records show that millions of men spent centuries constructing the Great Wall. Stand atop the wall at either Mutianyu or Jiankou, and you’ll begin to comprehend the gravity of this statement. These two sections are arguably the two most classic examples of Ming Dynasty Great Wall surviving today, and climbing either is guaranteed to be a life-changing experience. Mutianyu is the best portion of the “tourist wall.” Restored in the 1980s, it’s very commercial but also superbly beautiful. Visitors not up for the hike can take a cable car to the top. Off-the-radar destinations every visitor to China should consider To the west of Mutianyu, Jiankou is colloquially known as the “wild wall” – no ticket needed and not commercialized. That being said, as of 2020, hiking at Jiankou has become somewhat frowned upon by the local government because of safety concerns. Mutianyu and Jiankou are less than a 90-minute drive (without traffic) from downtown Beijing, yet it’s highly recommended to enjoy a night in the countryside if time allows. Jiankou can be accessed via Xizhazi village; if dates align, you might even be able to spend a few days with William Lindesay, world-renowned Great Wall historian, and his wonderful family at The Barracks, their wall-side courtyard home. For lodgings around Mutianyu, The Brickyard is a superbly comfortable choice. In fall and spring, shades of the wall’s gray brick contrast with nature’s vibrant colors. Peak autumn foliage and spring cherry blossoms provide stunning backdrops for photos. For winter sports enthusiasts, there’s skiing and skating next to the Wall at locations not far from Mutianyu. Getting to Mutianyu: Restrictions on applying for temporary driving licenses in China were relaxed in September 2019, so renting a car as a foreign tourist is entirely possible. (International driving licenses are not accepted in China.) You can also hire a car with a driver for the day or take the Mutianyu Special Tourism Bus from the Dongzhimen Wai Bus Station. Getting to Jiankou: Renting a car or booking private transport is recommended. As Xizhazi is a small village, buses are scarce so it can take up to five hours to get there by public transport, as opposed to 90 minutes by car. Bataizi village sits just inside the Motianling section of the Great Wall and is home to the ruins of a Gothic church built in 1876 under the direction of a German missionary. The church has been damaged and repaired numerous times in its nearly 150-year history; the bell tower is the only part still standing. The juxtaposition of its ruins against the rammed-earth Great Wall makes Bataizi a unique place to spend a morning or afternoon. China's best new outdoor attractions After finishing your hike along the wall and visiting the church ruins, drop in to the village’s “new” church to say hello to Father Pan; if you speak Chinese, he can answer any questions about the village’s long connection with Catholicism. Besides Bataizi, Datong should also be on your tourist map; visiting the Yungang Grottoes (a UNESCO world heritage site) and the Hengshan Hanging Temple will make your trip even more memorable. Late summer is an ideal time to visit Bataizi, as you’ll see a wonderful contrast between the Great Wall and the lush green hills. Getting there: Bataizi village is 80 kilometers west of Datong, one of Shanxi province’s largest and most famous cities. Zuoyun County is only 22 kilometers away from Bataizi – about a 35-minute drive. Datong is easily accessible by plane or high-speed train from other cities in China; a taxi from downtown Datong to Bataizi should cost roughly 300 yuan (about $43). Alternatively, you can make your way to Zuoyun County by bus then hop in a taxi. In Datong, luxury seekers will want to head for the five-star Yunzhong Traditional Courtyard Hotel. Zuoyun County has one hotel that can accept foreigners: Zuoyun Jinshan International Hotel. Both can be found on popular hotel booking sites. As the locals say, Laoniuwan is where the Great Wall and the mighty Yellow River shake hands. The Laoniuwan Fortress was built in 1467, while the most famous tower of the Great Wall in this area, Wanghe Tower (literally meaning river-watching tower), was constructed in 1544. Laoniuwan village is located in Pianguan County, part of Xinzhou city in Shanxi province, just across the river from Inner Mongolia. Late summer or early fall is a great time to visit, as you’ll avoid the potentially dangerous mountain roads during spring rainstorms, or being uncomfortably cold in a place without great infrastructure. Along the Great Wall, there are only a few places where it meets bodies of water; of all those, this is the most stunning. A boat ride along the river is highly recommended. You’ll be able to soak in the natural beauty of the Yellow River Gorge while marveling at the steadfast resolve of these ancient architects. Swell life: China's surf scene is heating up Getting there: Laoniuwan is difficult to get to by public transportation. The best option is to rent or book a car to take you from Datong to Laoniuwan via Bataizi – this way, you’ll be able to see two incredible locations along the Great Wall in one trip. Pianguan is the nearest city, about one hour away. Pianguan does not have a train station or an airport. The only option is to arrive by bus. Shuozhou, 140 kilometers from Laoniuwan, has an airport opening later this year. Construction on the Great Wall in Simatai began in 1373. It was expanded and reinforced periodically throughout the Ming Dynasty. The Fairy Tower is one of the best-known towers of the wall at Simatai but also one of the least visited due to how difficult it is to access. Instead, aim to take in incredible views of the Fairy Tower from Wangjing Tower (just a few hundred meters away). It’s a journey that will satiate even the most adventurous hikers, yet can be done without any ropes, ladders or other essential safety gear. As with a visit to Mutianyu/Jiankou, this section of wall is guaranteed to deliver stunning views any time of year. My only suggestion is to wait for a clear day (usually visibility is great the day after it rains or snows), as the view from Wangjing Tower is unobstructed in every direction. The hike to the Fairy Tower will leave you in awe of the Northern Barbarians’ supposed determination to reach the capital; the mountains are nearly impassable on foot, let alone by horse, with sheer cliff faces on either side. It makes for absolutely world-class hiking and an interesting history lesson. Five-star lodgings are available at Hobo Farm; they also have an incredible restaurant that serves delicious Western and Chinese fare. For 4.5 star lodgings with a lower price tag, try Yatou’s Homestay. Both can be found on major hotel booking sites. Getting there: Both the Fairy Tower and Wangjing Tower should be accessed via Tangjiazhai village, located in Beijing’s Miyun district. Tangjiazhai village is 140 kilometers from downtown Beijing, depending on your route. Booking a private car from the city is probably the most time-effective way to get there. You can also take a high-speed train from Beijing Station to Miyun district and switch to a bus or taxi from there. Constructed during the reign of Emperor Jiajing (1507-1567), this single-wall section stands seven meters tall in some spots – no small feat considering it was made by piling stones. It’s located just across the road from the town of Dushikou, in Chicheng in Hebei province. The piled-stone wall at Dushikou is unique, as many other sections of the Great Wall close to Beijing were constructed using kiln-fired bricks. Dushikou is best visited in the summer, specifically July and August, when the rolling hills of the surrounding grasslands are peak green. Cool evenings make for perfect outdoor barbecue/bonfire weather. You’ll be able to find clean and comfortable farmhouse lodgings in Dushikou town; alternatively, Chicheng, 45 minutes away, has a range of hotels to choose from. Lamb skewers and roast leg of lamb are specialties in these parts, as this part of Hebei is very close to the border with Inner Mongolia. Noodle lovers should also try the local oat noodles, which are delicious. Getting there: Thanks to all the infrastructure built for the 2022 Winter Olympics, the drive to Dushikou has been shortened by almost two hours. If you prefer not to drive, hop on a bus to Chicheng from the Liuliqiao Transport Hub in Beijing and take a 45-minute taxi ride to Dushikou. Note that public transportation will take one or two hours longer than private car. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

Related gallery Inside 2022's 'CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute' Online voters selected her from among this year’s Top 10 CNN Heroes. Cheboi’s nonprofit, TechLit Africa, has provided thousands of students across rural Kenya with access to donated, upcycled computers — and the chance at a brighter future. Cheboi accepted the award with her mother, who she said “worked really hard to educate us.” At the beginning of her acceptance speech, Cheboi and her mother sang a song onstage that she explained had a special meaning when she was growing up. As CNN Hero of the Year, Cheboi will receive $100,000 to expand her work. She and the other top 10 CNN Heroes honored at Sunday’s gala all receive a $10,000 cash award and, for the first time, additional grants, organizational training and support from The Elevate Prize Foundation through a new collaboration with CNN Heroes. Nelly will also be named an Elevate Prize winner, which comes with a $300,000 grant and additional support worth $200,000 for her nonprofit. Cheboi grew up in poverty in Mogotio, a rural township in Kenya. “I know the pain of poverty,” said Cheboi, 29. “I never forgot what it was like with my stomach churning because of hunger at night.” A hard-working student, Cheboi received a full scholarship to Augustana College in Illinois in 2012. She began her studies there with almost no experience with computers, handwriting papers and struggling to transcribe them onto a laptop. Related article This CNN Hero upcycles old computers to open new worlds for young Kenyans Everything changed in her junior year, though, when Cheboi took a programming course required for her mathematics major. “When I discovered computer science, I just fell in love with it. I knew that this is something that I wanted to do as my career, and also bring it to my community,” she told CNN. Many basic computer skills were still a steep learning curve, however. Cheboi remembers having to practice touch-typing for six months before she could pass a coding interview. Touch-typing is a skill that is now a core part of the TechLit curriculum. “I feel so accomplished seeing kids that are 7 years old touch-typing, knowing that I just learned how to touch-type less than five years ago,” she said. Once she had begun working in the software industry, Cheboi soon realized the extent of which computers were being thrown away as companies upgraded their technology infrastructure. Related video Watch Sofia Carson perform 'Applause' at CNN Heroes celebration “We have kids here (in Kenya) — myself included, back in the day — who don’t even know what a computer is,” she said. So, in 2018, she began transporting donated computers back to Kenya — in her personal luggage, handling customs fees and taxes herself. “At one point, I was bringing 44 computers, and I paid more for the luggage than I did for the air ticket,” she said. A year later, she co-founded TechLit Africa with a fellow software engineer after both quit their jobs. The nonprofit accepts computer donations from companies, universities and individuals. The hardware is wiped and refurbished before it’s shipped to Kenya. There, it’s distributed to partner schools in rural communities, where students ages 4 to 12 receive daily classes and frequent opportunities to learn from professionals, gaining skills that will help improve their education and better prepare them for future jobs. “We have people who own a specific skill coming in and are just inspiring the kids (with) music production, video production, coding, personal branding,” Cheboi said. “They can go from doing a remote class with NASA on education to music production.” The organization currently serves 10 schools; within the next year, Cheboi hopes to be partnered with 100 more. “My hope is that when the first TechLit kids graduate high school, they’re able to get a job online because they will know how to code, they will know how to do graphic design, they will know how to do marketing,” Cheboi said. “The world is your oyster when you are educated. By bringing the resources, by bringing these skills, we are opening up the world to them.” CNN’s Anderson Cooper and ABC’s Kelly Ripa co-hosted the 16th Annual “CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute,” which featured more than a dozen celebrity presenters. “We’re so deeply honored to be here,” said actress and singer Sofia Carson, who perfomed a song with award-winning songwriter Diane Warren at the event. “Diane wrote this incredible anthem ‘Applause’ for those leading, surviving and fighting and tonight we dedicate this song and performance to our heroes.” Actor Aubrey Plaza introduced CNN Hero Aidan Reilly, who launched his nonprofit while home from college during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic. “From his pandemic couch, Aidan and his friends co-founded Farmlink Project,” Plaza said. The nonprofit connects excess food from farms across the US – food that would otherwise be wasted – to those who need it. “In just two years, he .. has moved more than 70 million pounds,” Plaza added.

And Emmy award-winning actor Justin Theroux brought his rescue dog Kuma, on the stage to honor Carie Broecker ​​and her nonprofit, Peace of Mind Dog Rescue. Two teenagers making a difference in their communities were also honored as 2022 Young Wonders: Ruby Chitsey, a 15-year-old from Harrison, Arkansas, started “Three Wishes for Ruby’s Residents,” which donates personal items to nursing home residents who couldn’t otherwise afford them. Sri Nihal Tammana, a 13-year-old from Edison, New Jersey, started “Recycle My Battery,” which keeps used batteries out of the ecosystem through a network of collection bins. The show also honored two Georgia poll workers, Shaye Moss and her mother Ruby Freeman, whose lives were upended after false allegations that they had been involved in election fraud spread on social media. CNN has partnered with GoFundMe to enable donations to this year’s Top 10 honorees. GoFundMe is the world’s largest fundraising platform that empowers people and charities to give and receive help. Supporters can make online donations to the Top 10 CNN Heroes’ non-profit organizations directly from CNNHeroes.com.

It gives you plenty of time to pay off purchases and balance transfers without incurring interest charges. Those who can make do with a shorter intro APR period should look for cards with more benefits, such as cash rewards and a welcome offer. The nice thing about credit cards with a 0% intro APR is that it's easy to compare them. The key factor is how long the intro rate lasts -- on purchases, balance transfers, or both, depending on what you need the card for. For example, if you have a lot of debt and are looking for a way to refinance it, then you'd probably want to go with the card that has the longest 0% intro APR on balance transfers. Wells Fargo has done a great job in this regard. Not only does this card have a lengthy introductory period, it applies to purchases and balance transfers. Want to know what other sites and real cardholders think of the Wells Fargo Reflect® Card? Here's what we found. Average competitor rating: 4.1 / 5 stars After reading reviews from five other top sites, there's a pretty clear consensus about this Wells Fargo card. We all agree that the 0% intro APR offer is excellent, making it one of the best credit cards for avoiding interest, and that the cellphone protection is a valuable extra. Everyone's in agreement about this card's drawbacks, too: Lack of rewards, a high balance transfer fee, and a foreign transaction fee. The only difference of opinion is the overall rating each of us gave this card. The Wells Fargo Reflect® Card hasn't exactly set the social media world on fire, but responses have generally been positive. It's widely recognized as an excellent 0% intro APR and balance transfer card. Some cardholders have called out the balance transfer fee of 5%, min: $5, since that's more than the 3% charged by several other cards. But they also acknowledge that 21 months from account opening is a long time to pay off credit card debt. If you need to avoid interest charges for as long as possible, look no further. The Wells Fargo Reflect® Card has a 0% intro APR on purchases and qualifying balance transfers for 21 months from account opening. That's nearly two years where you won't be paying credit card interest. Balance transfers made within the first 120 days qualify for the intro rate. After the intro period ends, the go-to 18.24%, 24.74%, or 29.99% Variable APR applies on your card's balance going forward. This is the longest 0% intro APR I've seen. Since it applies to purchases and balance transfers, there are all kinds of ways to use it. You could: Considering how much smartphones cost, and the many hazards they seem to face, it's a good idea to have yours insured. They may seem affordable when you're paying them off across 24 monthly payments. When you lose one and need to pay MSRP for a new iPhone, that's when you realize it costs about as much as a rent payment. If you have this card and use it to pay your monthly cellphone bill, you won't need to shell out extra for insurance. It has complimentary cellphone protection of up to $600, with a $25 deductible. This covers damage, theft, and involuntary or accidental parting (when you know where your phone is, but it's impractical to recover it). The biggest drawback with this card is that it doesn't offer any sort of rewards program. That means: To be fair, this card has special offers through My Wells Fargo Deals, where you can earn cash back statement credits on shopping, dining, and experiences you pay for with your eligible Wells Fargo card. But earning some statement credits here and there isn't nearly as valuable as earning cash rewards on all your everyday purchases. Because of the lack of rewards, this card doesn't have much long-term value. Once the 0% intro APR ends, there's no incentive to continue using it. You're better off switching to a rewards credit card at that point. It's worth noting that there are 0% APR credit cards that also have rewards programs. They just have shorter 0% APR intro periods. If you don't need the entire 21 months from account opening this Wells Fargo card offers, then it could make more sense to pick a card with a shorter intro period that earns rewards. The Wells Fargo Reflect® Card is a great balance transfer card because of its 0% intro APR. But it also has a balance transfer fee of 5%, min: $5. Balance transfer cards normally have a fee like this, but some of them only charge 3%. It may not seem like much, but if you're transferring $5,000, that 2% difference would cost you an extra $100. If you don't need 21 months from account opening to get out of debt, you may want to look at more credit card reviews and pick a card with a lower balance transfer fee. There's also a foreign transaction fee of 3%, which is another reason why this isn't the best card for long-term use. If you ever travel outside the United States, it's important to have a card you can use without any extra fees, like a travel credit card A FICO® Score of 670 or higher, which is considered good credit, is suggested to apply for the Wells Fargo Reflect® Card. Keep in mind that credit card applications depend on many factors, including your income and other parts of your financial profile. Wells Fargo offers an online prequalification tool. All you need to do is provide some basic information, and you'll see any prequalified credit card offers you have with Wells Fargo, which may or may not include the Wells Fargo Reflect® Card. The Wells Fargo Reflect® Card has a 0% intro APR for 21 months from account opening on purchases and qualifying balance transfers. Balance transfers made within 120 days from account opening qualify for the introductory rate. Here are the fees for the Wells Fargo Reflect® Card: The minimum credit limit on the Wells Fargo Reflect® Card is $1,000. It's possible to get a much larger amount -- some cardholders have reported being approved for limits of over $25,000. When you're approved for this card, Wells Fargo sets a credit limit based on several factors, primarily your income and credit history. If you want to earn cash rewards: The Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card earns an unlimited 2% cash rewards on purchases and has a $200 cash rewards welcome bonus for spending $500 in the first three months. This card's intro APR doesn't last as long, but if you don't need as long as 21 months, then its cash rewards could make it a better choice. If you want a lower balance transfer fee: The Citi Double Cash® Card has a balance transfer fee of 3% ($5 min.) on transfers in the first four months, 5% ($5 min.) thereafter. Those transfers also qualify for a 0% intro APR for 18 months. If you can pay off your debt within a year and a half, this card is a good choice, because you'll save money on fees.

2,2024-08-02 07:37:00.000,BBC News,2024-08-02 05:36:52.000,Americans freed in Russia prisoner swap reunite with families,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2g2dx7d9wo,2024-08-02 04:44:34.000,"Three Americans including Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who were freed in a prisoner swap deal with Russia, have arrived back on US soil. Mr Gershkovich, 32, was one of 16 prisoners swapped for eight Russian prisoners in what has been described as the biggest exchange since the end of the Cold War between Russia and the West. The exchange at an airfield in Turkey also included the release of former US marine Paul Whelan, and Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva. After touching down at Joint Base Andrews, in Maryland, Mr Gershkovich, Ms Kurmasheva and Mr Whelan emerged from the jet to cheers from those on the tarmac. All three were greeted by US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris - before each embraced their families. They lingered on the tarmac for photographs and conversations before leaving the air base within an hour, as did Mr Biden and Ms Harris's motorcades. Speaking ahead of their return, Mr Biden welcomed their release and declared: 'Their brutal ordeal is over."" He praised the role played by America's allies, particularly Germany and Slovenia, and hailed the release of Mr Whelan, Mr Gershkovich, Ms Kurmasheva as well as leading Kremlin critic Vladimir Kara-Murza as a ""feat of diplomacy"". The three released Americans will be transported to the Brooke Army Medical Centre in Texas for a medical check-up. The deal had been more than 18 months in the making and appears to have hinged on Moscow's demand for the return of Vadim Krasikov - who was serving a life sentence in Germany for carrying out an assassination in a Berlin park. He is now back in Russia. In total, 24 people from prisons in seven different countries were exchanged in Ankara, Turkey's presidency said. The prisoners were from the US, Germany, Poland, Slovenia, Norway, Russia, and Belarus, it said in a statement. Ten people, including two minors, were relocated to Russia, 13 prisoners to Germany, and three to the US, the statement added. In Russia, President Vladimir Putin personally greeted the released Russians with bouquets of flowers at Moscow's Vnukovo Airport. He embraced them warmly on a red carpet and said they would be given state awards. Among those returned to Moscow in addition to Krasikov was a Russian couple, convicted of spying in Slovenia, who returned to Russia with their two children. Both Nato and the European Union welcomed the release which it said was mediated by Turkey. German citizen Rico Krieger, who was sentenced to death in Belarus before being pardoned by the country's leader Alexander Lukashenko earlier this week, has also been released. Earlier prisoner swap discussions had included jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, but the offer collapsed when he died in unclear circumstances in an Arctic penal colony in February. His widow Yulia Navalnaya welcomed the swap, describing it as a ""joy"". The exchange comes after days of speculation about a major swap between various countries, which increased after several dissidents and journalists jailed in Russia were moved from their prison cells to unknown locations. Although secret prison transfers are common in Russia, the multiple disappearances of well-known prisoners was unusual. The last high-profile prisoner swap took place in December 2022, when US basketball star Brittney Griner was exchanged on the tarmac at Abu Dhabi airport for notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, who had been held in an American prison for 12 years. The last comparable one occurred in Vienna in 2010, when 10 Russian spies held in the US were swapped for four alleged double agents held in Russia. One of them was Sergei Skripal, a former military intelligence officer, later poisoned by nerve agent Novichok in Salisbury in 2018. Tensions between Moscow and the West have been high in recent years, especially since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Some 16 prisoners were released by Russia, including US citizens Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan. The president is using his final months in office to take a victory lap after weeks of personal and political turmoil. The prisoner exchange between Russia and Western countries is the biggest since the Cold War. Americans Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan are shown being escorted by officers at an undisclosed location. The US president thanked his allies, who he says played a key role in the prisoner exchange. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

2,2024-08-02 07:37:00.000,BBC News,2024-08-02 05:36:52.000,How stage was set for biggest prisoner swap since Cold War,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj50l9dy3emo,2024-08-01 15:55:49.000,"“This is a matter best dealt with in silence.” It’s the phrase of choice of Russian officials when asked to comment on possible East-West prisoner exchanges. Words we’ve been hearing for months. This is how the Kremlin likes it: deal-making behind closed doors, ""hostage diplomacy"" far from the media spotlight. Intelligence service talking to intelligence service; government to government. Until Moscow gets what – or rather whom – it wants. But despite the ""silence"", there were signals. Something was moving. In an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson last February, Vladimir Putin spoke about Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter who had been arrested in Russia and charged with espionage. “I do not rule out that Mr Gershkovich may return to his homeland,” Mr Putin said. “We want the US special services to think about how they can contribute to achieving the goals our special services are pursuing.” It was a very public and unsubtle hint: Moscow was open to doing a deal. The Kremlin leader didn’t name names. But he made it quite clear whom Russia wanted in return: Vadim Krasikov, the suspected Russian agent who was serving a life sentence for murder - not in America, but in Germany. A few days later, Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny died in a remote Arctic penal colony. Rumours swirled that before his death, talks had been under way on exchanging Mr Navalny, Evan Gershkovich and former US marine Paul Whelan, all jailed in Russia, for Vadim Krasikov in Germany. Had the German authorities entered negotiations on a prisoner swap? Fast forward to June. Evan Gershkovich’s closed-door spy trial – dismissed as a “sham” by the Wall Street Journal and the US government - finally began in Yekaterinburg. The case was quickly adjourned until mid-August. But last month, the court unexpectedly brought the second hearing forward by more than three weeks. At the end of a lightning-fast three-day trial, Evan Gershkovich was convicted and sentenced to 16 years in a penal colony. The very same day, US-Russian journalist Alsu Kurmasheva was sentenced to six-and-a-half years in prison by a court in Kazan. Her trial had lasted just two days. Someone was clearly in a hurry. It was the strongest sign yet that a deal had been done, that a swap was likely. The Russian authorities normally treat a conviction as a prerequisite for any prisoner exchange. Earlier this week - more signals, with reports that a string of prominent Russian political prisoners had been moved from their penal colonies or detention centres. Speculation grew. Might these dissidents be part of a larger prisoner exchange than had originally been anticipated? News broke in Belarus: the country’s leader, Alexander Lukashenko, had agreed to pardon Rico Krieger, a German citizen sentenced to death on terrorism and other charges. Could he be part of a swap? Now we know. This is the largest East-West prisoner exchange since the Cold War. Western governments will welcome the release of foreigners, as well as freedom for some of Russia’s most prominent political prisoners. Moscow will celebrate the return of its agents. Both sides will claim it’s a good deal. But if Russia concludes, as it has done in the past, that ""hostage diplomacy"" works, then worryingly, this is unlikely to be the last time that prisoners here – both foreigners and Russians – are used as bargaining chips. The president is using his final months in office to take a victory lap after weeks of personal and political turmoil. Hungarian PM Viktor Orban sparked anger last week by accusing the EU of pursuing a ""pro-war policy"". Since the invasion of Ukraine, the measures used to clamp down on Kremlin critics have swelled. Vadim Shamarin oversaw military communications when he was accused of taking bribes from a factory. The Hungarian prime minister is a key Trump ally and has publicly endorsed his re-election bid.

2,2024-08-02 07:37:00.000,BBC News,2024-08-02 05:36:52.000,Hezbollah leader says conflict with Israel in 'new phase' after killings,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn05v009n2ko,2024-08-01 20:29:55.000,"In Beirut’s southern suburbs of Dahiya, the stronghold of Hezbollah, large crowds wearing black joined the funeral for Fuad Shukr, a senior commander of the powerful Lebanese militia and political movement, and the most high-profile member to have been assassinated by Israel during these current hostilities. They carried placards with Shukr’s face, waved the yellow-and-green Hezbollah flag and chanted some of the group’s slogans, sometimes with their fists in the air. According to the Israeli military, Shukr was behind a missile strike that killed 12 children and teenagers on a football field in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights last Saturday. Hezbollah has denied involvement, although it initially claimed an attack on a nearby military base, which raised the possibility that the missile missed its intended targeted. Shukr, who was also known as al-Hajj Mohsin, was said to be a close adviser to Hassan Nasrallah, the influential and long-time Hezbollah leader. As people were gathered, Nasrallah gave a televised speech that was watched closely for any indication of Hezbollah’s possible next moves. The conflict with Israel had entered a “new phase"", he said, speaking from a secret location, as he always does for security reasons. The enemy must wait for the “inevitable response” because it had crossed “red lines”, he added, saying that the reaction would be proportionate to Israel’s targeting of a civilian building. His tone seemed to indicate that the group remained uninterested in another major war with Israel. But there are concerns that they could be sliding into one. “I’m not afraid of war. We’re ready for whatever Sheikh Nasrallah decides to do,” one man in the crowd told me. “Inshallah,” said another, meaning God willing, when asked if he believed that Hezbollah would retaliate for the killing. Shukr's killing on Tuesday - an attack that killed six other people, including two young siblings - renewed fears that the relatively contained conflict between Hezbollah and Israel could escalate into an all-out war, with the potential to engulf the entire Middle East. Hezbollah says its campaign, which started a day after the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October, is in support of Palestinians in Gaza. Most of the group’s attacks, and Israel’s counterattacks, have been limited to areas along the Lebanon-Israel border. Supported by Iran, Hezbollah has long been seen by Israel as a much more formidable foe than Hamas. The group has an increasingly sophisticated arsenal of weapons that includes attack drones and precision guided missiles capable of striking deep inside Israel. A conflict with Hezbollah would probably involve other Iranian-supported groups in the region, members of what Tehran calls the “Axis of Resistance” - the Houthis in Yemen or militias in Iraq, for example. Iran, too, has vowed to respond to the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas political chief who was killed on Wednesday while visiting Tehran for the inauguration of the new Iranian president. Iran and Hamas have blamed Israel, which has stayed silent. The killing has dealt a blow to the possibility of any success in ongoing talks for a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. It is the main hope to defuse tensions with Hezbollah, and diplomatic efforts continue to try to de-escalate the situation. The Israeli military has said it is ready for any scenario, as the country braces itself for a possible response to the two assassinations. Nasrallah’s speech contained, as expected, sharp words against Israel but did not appear to suggest that a bigger war was imminent just yet. The strike on 1 April killed seven charity workers from the World Central Kitchen, including one Australian. What we know about Hamas leaders since the start of the war with Israel. Benjamin Netanyahu warned Israel that ""challenging days lies ahead"" after Iran threatened ""harsh punishment"". Israel had accused Fuad Shukr, a top Hezbollah commanders, of masterminding operations against Israel. The Hamas leader was assassinated in Tehran, and it is widely believed Israel was behind the killing. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

In a statement Antony Blinken said it was clear Edmundo González, had won the most votes - despite incumbent president Nicolás Maduro declaring a disputed victory. ""Given the overwhelming evidence, it is clear to the United States and, most importantly, to the Venezuelan people that Edmundo González Urrutia won the most votes in Venezuela's 28 July presidential election,"" Mr Blinken said. His intervention comes as the presidents of Brazil, Mexico and Colombia all called on Venezuela to release the full details of last Sunday's election. Last Sunday, the electoral council, which is government-controlled, announced President Maduro had won the election for a third term. But this was immediately disputed by the opposition who said, with access to the majority of receipts from electronic voting machines around the country, it was false. The opposition has said its own vote tally shows it won the election by a wide margin. Opinion polls ahead of the election had suggested a clear victory for the challenger. President Maduro has previously accused foreign governments of interfering in the election. He has strongly denied electoral fraud and has said the opposition has instigated a coup by disputing the result. The announcement of President Maduro’s victory set off deadly protests in Caracas. It has also attracted global criticism, with many governments around the world demanding the Venezuelan government release proof of the result. The result has been recognised by Venezuelan allies China, Russia and Iran. But, the US, European Union and other G7 countries have called on President Maduro’s government to release detailed voting data. Posting on social media, Mr Blinken said: ""Electoral data overwhelmingly demonstrate the will of the Venezuelan people: democratic opposition candidate Edmundo González won the most votes in Sunday’s election. ""Venezuelans have voted, and their votes must count."" The intervention by Mr Blinken is significant. After the last election in 2018 was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair, countries including the US decided to recognise the then-opposition leader Juan Guaido as interim president and imposed sanctions on Venezuela. Mr Blinken said it was “time for the Venezuelan parties to begin discussions on a respectful, peaceful transition in accordance with Venezuelan electoral law and the wishes of the Venezuelan people"". Opposition leader María Corina Machado, who says she is in hiding, has called for mass demonstrations on Saturday. Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, Ms Machado said Mr Maduro did not win the election. She claimed her party's candidate, Mr Gonzalez, won by a landslide and Ms Machado said she could prove this because she had receipts from more than 80% of polling stations. Ms Machado appealed for help, saying it was now up to the international community to decide whether to tolerate what she called an illegitimate government. Hundreds of demonstrators have been detained following Venezuela's disputed presidential election. Under pressure to back up claims he won the election, President Maduro turns to the country's top court. The Carter Center says the presidential election ""cannot be considered democratic"". Jordan Goudreau, 48, allegedly sent weapons, ammunition and other gear without a US export licence. The opposition says it has proof President Maduro's victory claim is fraudulent; his defence minster has warned of a ""coup"". Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

2,2024-08-02 07:37:00.000,BBC News,2024-08-02 05:36:52.000,"Hamas military chief was killed in July strike, Israel says",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv3gpy74ydo,2024-08-01 13:09:42.000,"Israel's military says it has confirmed that Hamas's military chief Mohammed Deif was killed in an Israeli air strike in the Gaza Strip last month. Deif was targeted in the strike on a compound in the Khan Younis area on 13 July. Hamas is yet to confirm his death. Israel says Deif was one of the figures responsible for planning the 7 October attacks in southern Israel in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. On Wednesday, Hamas political leader Ismael Haniyeh was killed during a visit to Iran. Israel has not commented on his death directly. The Israeli military said in a statement that ""following an intelligence assessment, it can be confirmed that Mohammed Deif was eliminated"" in the 13 July strike. Gaza’s Hamas-run health authorities said at the time of the air strike that it had killed more than 90 people, but denied that Deif was among the dead. Deif is widely seen as the second-ranking Hamas official in Gaza, behind Yahya Sinwar, the group's leader in the territory. Israel’s Defence Minister, Yoav Gallant, said the death of Deif is “a significant milestone” in the dismantling of Hamas. ""This operation reflects the fact that Hamas is disintegrating, and that Hamas terrorists may either surrender or they will be eliminated,"" he added. Mohammed Deif was appointed head of the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the military arm of the Hamas movement, in 2002. For decades he's been seen as one of Israel's most wanted men - and has survived a reported seven assassination attempts, including one that reportedly saw him lose an eye. He was born in Gaza's Khan Younis refugee camp in 1965, when the territory was occupied by Egypt. As a young man in the late 1980s, he joined Hamas shortly after its formation and quickly rose to prominence within the group. Israel accused him of planning and supervising bus bombings which killed tens of Israelis in 1996, and of involvement in the capture and killing of three Israeli soldiers in the mid-1990s.  Deif is also known to have helped engineer the construction of tunnels that have allowed Hamas fighters to enter Israel from Gaza. During his leadership of the al-Qassam brigades, he was credited with designing Hamas's signature weapon, the Qassam rocket. In 2014, Israel attempted to kill Deif with an air strike on a house in the Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood of Gaza, which killed Deif's wife, Widad, and their infant son, Ali. Israel thought it had killed Deif, too, but he was not in the building at the time. Enemies are known to have dubbed Deif ‘the cat with nine lives’, due to the fact he survived so many attempts on his life. During the current conflict, Deif is believed to have directed Hamas' military operations from within underground tunnels inside Gaza.  Israel's confirmation of Deif's death comes at the end of a turbulent week in the Israel-Gaza conflict, which has stoked fears of a broader regional war. On Saturday, 12 Druze children and young people were killed after a rocket fell on a football field in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed Lebanon-based Hezbollah, saying they would pay ""a heavy price"". On Tuesday, Israel retorted with air strike on Beirut which killed senior Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr, as well as four others, including two children. Hours later, Hamas’s political leader Ismael Haniyeh was killed in a strike on a building he was staying in during a visit to Iran’s capital, Tehran. Iran has blamed Israel for Haniyeh's death, threatening “harsh punishment”. The strike on 1 April killed seven charity workers from the World Central Kitchen, including one Australian.

2,2024-08-02 07:37:00.000,BBC News,2024-08-02 05:36:52.000,Hamas leader's funeral draws crowds in Iran,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz5rd0p2lxeo,2024-08-01 08:55:11.000,"Thousands have turned out for the funeral procession in Iran of the Hamas political chief, Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in a strike in Tehran on Wednesday. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, led prayers for the Hamas leader, whose body will be buried in Qatar. US media have quoted Iranian officials as saying the supreme leader has ordered a direct attack against Israel, which it says was responsible for the attack on Iranian soil. Israel has not commented on the assassination directly. However, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country had delivered “crushing blows” to its enemies in recent days, including the killing of a senior Hezbollah commander in Lebanon hours before the Tehran strike. He warned Israelis that “challenging days lie ahead”, as fears of a wider conflict in the Middle East grow. ""Since the strike in Beirut, we have heard threats from all sides,"" he told a televised address. ""We are prepared for any scenario and we will stand united and determined."" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned against a ""dangerous escalation"" of hostilities in the region. Hamas's armed wing said the death of Haniyeh, who was widely viewed as the group's overall leader, would ""take the battle to new dimensions"" and have major repercussions. While Haniyeh's funeral was still taking place, Israel's military said it had confirmed that Hamas's military chief, Mohammed Deif, was killed in an air strike in the Gaza Strip last month. Deif was targeted in the strike on a compound in the Khan Younis area on 13 July. Hamas is yet to confirm his death. Israel says Deif was one of the figures responsible for planning the 7 October attacks in southern Israel in which 1,200 people were killed. Since the attack, Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas. Haniyeh, who played an important role in negotiations over a ceasefire in Gaza, was killed hours after attending the inauguration of Iran's new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, in Tehran. A senior Hamas official told the BBC the killing took place in the same building where Haniyeh had stayed during previous visits to Iran. Three Hamas leaders and a number of guards were with him in the same building, they said. Khalil Al-Hayya, a senior Hamas official, told a news conference that a missile hit Haniyeh ""directly"", citing witnesses who were with him. The group's leadership has been left in ""a state of shock"", top Hamas officials have told the BBC. Hours before Haniyeh was targeted, Israel said it had killed senior Hezbollah leader Fuad Shukr in Beirut. Israel believes he was responsible for a rocket attack that killed 12 people in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Saturday. Hezbollah has denied any involvement. The Iran-backed group confirmed Shukr's body was found among the rubble of the residential building which was struck. Four other people, including two children, were killed. The strike on 1 April killed seven charity workers from the World Central Kitchen, including one Australian. What we know about Hamas leaders since the start of the war with Israel. Benjamin Netanyahu warned Israel that ""challenging days lies ahead"" after Iran threatened ""harsh punishment"". Israel had accused Fuad Shukr, a top Hezbollah commanders, of masterminding operations against Israel. The Hamas leader was assassinated in Tehran, and it is widely believed Israel was behind the killing. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

2,2024-08-02 07:37:00.000,BBC News,2024-08-02 05:36:52.000,"After 2,043 days in a Russian prison, Paul Whelan finally heads home",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ngn52zpnno,2024-08-02 01:03:53.000,"Paul Whelan must have doubted this moment was ever going to come. It has been 2,043 days since Federal Security Service (FSB) agents in balaclavas burst into his Moscow hotel room, pinned him to the ground and announced he was being arrested for espionage. I followed Mr Whelan’s case closely in Moscow from the very start and remember the day he first arrived in court looking more like a dazed librarian than a dastardly intelligence agent. His hands were cuffed and he was cradling a cardboard box containing his prison lunch. He was too nervous to say much, at first, and I found out later he was being interrogated and threatened. As time passed Mr Whelan found his voice and began to denounce his jailing, loudly. Russia thinks it has caught James Bond, is how he put it one day, but in fact it got Mr Bean on holiday. After he was sentenced to 16 years, we spoke at length by phone from prison - Mr Whelan always insisted on his innocence. Born in Canada to British parents with Irish roots, he is a citizen of four countries – which made his arrest a big deal diplomatically. Long before any trial, Russia’s foreign minister claimed Mr Whelan had been caught ""red handed"" committing espionage. The court later heard he had been trying to get secret information from a friend - actually an FSB intelligence agent. But no evidence was ever made public. Mr Whelan, a former US Marine, was a fan of Russia and had visited several times. When he was arrested, he was in Moscow for the wedding of an American friend to a Russian woman and had spent the morning leading the guests around the Kremlin, including the locals. After his detention, I scoured his social media accounts for any contacts or clues. Some people were too nervous to talk, given the serious charge. But, all those who agreed to speak laughed at the idea that their friend could be involved in espionage. “If he’s a spy,” one of them wrote to me, with multiple exclamation marks, “then I’m Michael Jackson”. For a long time, Mr Whelan was relentlessly upbeat about his fate. He was convinced the US government would get him out, even as relations between Russia and the West slid from awful to much worse. Conditions in his prison camp, IK 17, were tough, locked up with ""child rapists and murderers"" as he once put it. He studied Russian – even Tajik - wrote letters, read spy novels. The rest of his time was spent sewing clothes in a prison workshop and the nights were interrupted, regularly, by the guards. They would shine a torch in his face to check he had not escaped. Despite all that, Mr Whelan told me he made a habit of singing his four national anthems out loud each morning - to annoy those guards and to keep his spirits up. He called himself a political hostage and told me repeatedly the FSB agents who took him - even the judge who convicted him - had all assured him he would be swapped. It is why he didn’t bother appealing his sentence. But as time passed, so did two other prisoner exchanges between Russia and the US, and both times Mr Whelan missed out. So when we spoke late last year, he admitted he felt abandoned by his government. Officially designated ""wrongfully detained"", he had been assured he was a priority, Mr Whelan told me. Then he had been “left in the dust"". That day on the phone he was despondent and frustrated like I had never heard before. Aware talks to free Evan Gershkovich - the US journalist accused of espionage - were under way, he worried he had been left behind again. Mr Whelan’s parents were ageing, his beloved dog Flora had died, he reminded me. He felt his life was ebbing away. Earlier this week, as rumours of a prisoner swap began flying, I called Mr Whelan’s old lawyer, Olga Karlova. She had seen the reports and told me she had written to IK 17 asking whether Mr Whelan was there. There was no reply. It was a key sign an exchange was happening, likely a major one, although nothing was confirmed until it was all safely under way and could not be derailed. Two days on, I’ve been watching pictures of Mr Whelan boarding a plane - no handcuffs, no prison uniform. He looks a little dazed, presumably exhausted. But five years after he landed in Moscow for a wedding party, he is at last heading home.

2,2024-08-02 07:37:00.000,BBC News,2024-08-02 05:36:52.000,Three men accused of plotting 9/11 reach plea deal - Pentagon,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cldy01z6xnpo,2024-08-01 17:10:08.000,"Three of the men accused of plotting the 11 September 2001 attacks on the US have entered into a pre-trial agreement, the Department of Defense says. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Walid Muhammad Salih Mubarak Bin Attash and Mustafa Ahmed Adam al-Hawsawi have been held at the US Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for years without going to trial. In exchange for the prosecution agreeing not to seek the death penalty, the trio have agreed to plead guilty to all of the charged offenses, including the murder of the 2,976 people listed in the charge sheet. The attacks in New York, Virginia and Pennsylvania sparked the ""War on Terror"" and the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. Brett Eagleson, the president of 9/11 Justice, an organisation that represents 9/11 survivors and relatives of victims, said in a statement provided to the BBC that the families are “deeply troubled by these plea deals”. He said the process lacked transparency and urged the authorities to pursue more information on the role of Saudi Arabia in the attacks. Terry Strada, who lost her husband Tom, told the BBC’s Today Programme: ""It was a gut-punch to hear that there was a plea deal today that was giving the detainees in Guantanamo Bay what they want.” Ms Strada, the national chair of the campaign group 9/11 Families United, added: ""This is a victory for Khalid Sheikh Mohammad and the other two, it's a victory for them,"" she said.  The 9/11 attacks were the deadliest assault on US soil since the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, where 2,400 people were killed. The plea deal was first announced in a letter sent by prosecutors to the families of victims, according to the BBC's US partner CBS News. It said the plea before a military court could come as early as next week. The trio would be sentenced later by a panel of military officers. In the letter, prosecutors said families may have the opportunity to deliver victim-impact statements during the sentencing hearing, which is expected to take place in the summer of 2025. Prosecutors also acknowledged the deal was likely to elicit ""intense emotion"" and ""mixed reactions"" among the thousands of family members who lost someone. ""The decision to enter into a pre-trial agreement after 12 years of pre-trial litigation was not reached lightly; however, it is our collective, reasoned, and good-faith judgment that this resolution is the best path to finality and justice in this case,"" prosecutors wrote in the letter. In its announcement, the US defence department said ""the specific terms and conditions of the pretrial agreements are not available to the public at this time"". The men have been accused of a litany of charges, including attacking civilians, murder in violation of the laws of war, hijacking and terrorism. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is widely considered the architect of the attack, in which hijackers seized passenger planes and crashed them into the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon outside of Washington. A fourth plane crashed into a field in Pennsylvania after passengers fought back. Mohammed, a US-educated engineer, was captured along with Hawsawi in Pakistan in March 2003. Prosecutors argued that he brought his idea of hijacking and flying planes into US buildings to al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, and later helped recruit and train some of the hijackers. He was subjected to a number of ""enhanced interrogation techniques"", including waterboarding - simulated drowning - at least 183 times before the practice was banned by the US government. The trial has been delayed for so long partly because of fears that the so-called brutal interrogation techniques which critics say amounted to torture could have undermined the evidence against the detainees. “This is the least bad deal in the real world that would ever happen,” national security analyst Peter Bergen told CNN. In September, the Biden administration reportedly rejected the terms of a plea deal with five men held at the US Navy base in Cuba, including Mohammed. The men had reportedly sought a guarantee from the president that they would not be kept in solitary confinement and would have access to trauma treatment. The White House National Security Council said that the president's office was told on Wednesday of the new deal and had played no role in negotiations. Fifteen of the 19 plane hijackers were Saudi nationals and families are bringing a lawsuit against the kingdom, which denies any involvement. Republicans attacked the Biden administration for striking a deal with the accused. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell condemned the move as ""a revolting abdication of the government's responsibility to defend America and provide justice"". ""The only thing worse than negotiating with terrorists is negotiating with them after they are in custody,"" he said.

2,2024-08-02 07:37:00.000,BBC News,2024-08-02 05:36:52.000,'Slave auction' pupils to face disciplinary in South Africa,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0ve3r5ydjvo,2024-07-31 18:34:18.000,"Four schoolchildren in South Africa are to face a disciplinary hearing over a viral video in which black students are seen being auctioned off as slaves, the authorities in Cape Town have told the BBC. The footage, showing pupils in a cage while other students bid for them, caused outrage when it was shared on social media last Friday. It was filmed at Pinelands High School and involved students in grade eight, which is the first year of secondary school when pupils are aged around 14. The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) has said it has opened its own investigation into the incident. It comes as two other schools in the country - where white-minority rule ended three decades ago with the election of anti-apartheid fighter Nelson Mandela as president - are dealing with alleged racist incidents. “It is disturbing that these incidences continue to occur 30 years into democracy,” the SAHRC said, adding it was even more distressing that they had occurred in schools. The four Pinelands High School students believed to be behind the mock auction are currently suspended. “The investigation is ongoing and nearing completion with 24 learners having been interviewed in the first two [school days] since the allegations were made,” Bronagh Hammond, spokesperson for the Western Cape Education Department, said on Wednesday in a statement sent to the BBC. “Steps will also be taken against other learners who may have transgressed certain provisions within the code of conduct,” she added. The incident first came to light after one of the pupils showed the footage to his mother, Merle Potgieter, who then told the school's management and local media. She says her son, who is 14, fought off boys who were attempting to force him into the caged enclosure alongside other black boys who were already inside it. According to Ms Potgieter the alleged perpetrators were coloured - which is a South African term meaning mixed-race. In the footage of the mock auction, children can be heard calling out various bids of up to 100,000 rand ($5,400; £4,200). ""Going once... going twice... sold!"" one boy can be heard shouting. Counselling support had been prioritised for those affected - and all grade eight pupils had had debriefing sessions, Ms Hammond said. Slavery in Cape Town dates back to the 1650s when the Dutch colonised the peninsula and thousands of enslaved people were brought to the region from south-east Asia, Madagascar and Mozambique. Today Cape Town is considered one of the most racially segregated and unequal cities in South Africa, despite its multi-ethnic mix. This is due to the legacy of apartheid, when the white regime in the 1950s pushed black and mixed-raced communities into segregated townships outside the city. The apartheid government also entrenched a racial hierarchy, which put black people right at the bottom. On Tuesday, MP Makhi Feni, chair of the parliamentary committee on education, urged the schools at the heart of the latest scandals to “consider meaningful programmes that will foster social cohesion and South African-ness”. “The question we all ought to ask genuinely is what emboldens a person, hardly a teenager, with no knowledge of where we come from as a country, to act in a manner that points to racism. Surely, our children are not and should not be racist,” he said. Meanwhile, the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party is demanding that the pupils be suspended for at least two years and perform ""community service in black areas"". It has threatened to call protests and shut down the school if it finds the authorities' ultimate handling of the incident less than satisfactory.

2,2024-08-02 07:37:00.000,BBC News,2024-08-02 05:36:52.000,Hopes for survivors fade in deadly India landslides,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2g0jmm7vro,2024-08-01 08:01:45.000,"Hopes of finding more survivors are fading as rescue operations continue in Kerala, where massive landslides have killed 182 people, according to officials. Nearly 200 people are still missing after Mundakkai and Chooralmala areas in Wayanad district were flattened by thick torrents of mud and water on Tuesday. Rescue operations have been hampered by heavy rains in the region all week. The army is constructing a temporary bridge to Mundakkai, which is across a swollen river, to help stranded residents and search for more survivors. Health officials reported 256 autopsies, but that included a number of body parts. On Thursday, Wayanad remained on high alert for more rains as schools and colleges were closed for the day. The hilly district is known for its cardamom plantations and tea estates and has several popular tourist spots. Officials said nearly 1,600 people had been rescued from the affected villages and tea estates. But migrant workers from the estates were among those still missing. More than 8,000 people have been moved to 82 relief camps set up in the district, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said. The army is now building a temporary metal bridge to Mundakkai village, which is among the worst affected by the landslides. Earlier, rescuers had constructed a temporary pedestrian bridge and used ropes to rappel across the river to reach stranded people there and move the injured to hospitals. But heavy rains and strong river current had made it difficult to carry out full-fledged rescue work. The temporary metal bridge is expected to be complete by Thursday evening. It will allow ambulances and heavy machinery to move rubble and search for survivors, Major General Vinod Mathew told reporters. Meanwhile, the air force is conducting sorties to identify areas with survivors and distribute relief material. Three army sniffer dogs were expected to reach the disaster zone to help detect people still trapped under the rubble. ""Still large areas are to be explored and searched to find out whether live people are there or not,"" senior police officer MR Ajith Kumar told AFP news agency on Wednesday. TV footage showed harrowing scenes at relief camps and hospitals as survivors searched for their loved ones or waited for news of them. One man listed out names of those who had still not been found as he told Manorama News, ""My house was spared but I have lost many children who were like my own."" At a community centre that had bodies displayed for identification, a young man told The NewsMinute that he had identified two of his uncles, but was still searching for seven other relatives. ""I am in touch with people at other centres where bodies are placed and they are sending me pictures, but I am yet to identify any of my other missing relatives,"" he told the news site. With more heavy rainfall forecast for the district, the government has warned residents to be prepared for flash floods. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

From 15 August onwards, the carrier will stop serving the noodles to economy class passengers. It said the increased risk of turbulence, narrow aisles and passengers sitting closely together could mean ""burn incidents occur frequently"". Business and first class fliers, however, will continue to enjoy the treat. The snack has long been a passenger favourite and something the carrier is widely known for. Many praise the fact that it is available for free on request. In a statement, the carrier said that since 2019 the number of times turbulence had occurred on its flights had doubled. It added that in economy class, several cups of noodles are all served at once, saying that the ""risk of burns is greater with passengers crowded together"". But in business and first class the snacks are brought individually to these passengers, reducing the likelihood of spillage in the event of turbulence, the carrier said. Up until now, the Korean carrier had been providing the noodles for free to passengers on longer routes. But this will now be replaced with sandwiches, corn dogs, pizza and ""Hot Pockets"" - crusty turnovers filled with cheese, meat and vegetables. The move sparked discussion on social media. Some users expressed relief, while others pointed out that the carrier was still serving other items that could cause burns. ""Aren't coffee and tea hot?"" said one comment. However, another called it a ""very good decision"", saying they had always been ""nervous"" that they would be scalded. One user said they had hoped the instant noodles would be removed ""because of the smell"". Korean Air said it will ""continue to seek service methods that are safe while increasing customer convenience and satisfaction"". Earlier this year, Singapore Airlines said it would stop serving hot drinks and meals during turbulence as part of a ""more cautious approach"". A 73-year-old British passenger died and dozens more were injured when flight SQ 321 encountered turbulence over Myanmar and was diverted to Thailand in May. Turbulence is one of the most unpredictable of all weather phenomena, with severe turbulence becoming more likely with climate change, recent research shows. It is thought the technology will enable quicker and cleaner journeys across short distances. Some Rex Airlines flights have since been cancelled, with a number of its planes grounded The airline blamed difficulties securing more efficient aircraft and sustainable jet fuel. Thousands more passengers could face delays or cancellations after an arson attack on France's train network on Friday. South Korea said it would request a meeting with International Olympic Committee Chairman Thomas Bach. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

2,2024-08-02 07:37:00.000,BBC News,2024-08-02 05:36:52.000,Italy prepares to open controversial migrant centre in Albania,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lke090kgko,2024-08-01 07:20:23.000,"Italy, which receives the most migrant arrivals in the European Union, is partially outsourcing the challenge from today, as it opens the first of two planned camps in neighbouring Albania. Migrants will only start to arrive at the camps once both are open and operational. The centres will be used to house up to 3000 migrants per month rescued en route to Italy as part of Europe’s first ""offshoring"" scheme, while the continent grapples with how to respond to the challenge of irregular migration. The camp that opens today is located in the northern Albanian port of Shengjin. The opening of a second centre, on a former air force base in nearby Gjader, has been delayed. The structures will be entirely managed by the Italian government, which paid for their construction. They will be used for migrants picked up in international waters – though not women, children, or those deemed vulnerable. Once there, they will be allowed to request asylum in Italy. If refused, they will be sent back to countries deemed safe to return. “Italian and European legislation will be applied in these centres,"" Fabrizio Bucci, Italy’s ambassador in Albania, told me. “It’s like having a centre in Italy – but in Albania.” The agreement signed by the Italian and Albanian Prime Ministers will remain in place for five years – with the option to extend if it proves successful in reducing the migrant burden on Italy and deterring some from attempting to come. Arrivals in Italy by sea this year – around 31,000 so far – are down by more than half from the same period in 2023. Giorgia Meloni, the Italian Prime Minister, ran for office promising to clamp down hard on migration – and the Albania plan has become a key tenet of that. The hefty price tag, estimated at upwards of €650m (£547), is one of the criticisms levelled by Italian opposition politicians and human rights groups. “It’s an excessive cost to detain a limited number of migrants”, said Riccardo Magi, an MP with the left-wing +Europa party. When Ms Meloni recently visited the site in Albania, he approached her car to protest – and was grabbed by Albanian security officials. As she intervened, telling them to ease off, he shouted: “If they treat an elected MP like this, imagine how they’ll treat the migrants”. Speaking to the BBC, he compared the structures to a penal colony. He also doubted the ability of night-time rescuers to properly screen those picked up to ensure that no vulnerable individuals are sent to Albania. ""They won’t be able to delve deep into whether somebody has suffered torture or sexual violence or discrimination due to their sexuality back in Africa”, Mr Magi said. “It’s all an attempt at dissuasion and a PR show to tell Italians this is the first time a government can keep migrants out. But nobody who has risked their life to cross to Italy will be discouraged.” Fabrizio Bucci, the Italian ambassador in Tirana, disagrees. “It’s one of the elements that migrants and smugglers will have to factor in,"" he said. “What do we have to lose? We’ve been trying to redistribute migrants throughout the EU and it hasn’t worked. So why not try to chart a new way?” He refers to it as an experiment that, if successful, could be replicated. Indeed, 15 EU members, led by Denmark, recently wrote an open letter to the European Commission backing the outsourcing of migration. Sir Keir Starmer praised the Italy-Albania deal after meeting both Prime Ministers. It has drawn comparison with the plan of the previous Conservative government to deport failed asylum seekers from the United Kingdom to Rwanda – ditched by Mr Starmer. But the agreements are significantly different. While Rwanda would have managed the asylum requests and centres under its deal, giving successful claimants asylum there and deporting failed ones to third countries deemed safe by the Rwandan government, the Albania deal will be under Italian jurisdiction. “We made sure the Albanian legislation was already in full compliance with EU and international laws”, said Ambassador Bucci. For Albania, the reward is a boost to its image as it negotiates European Union membership. But Vladimir Karaj, a Tirana-based journalist with the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network, said it was a “complete surprise” when it was announced by the Prime Minister Edi Rama. Before the Rwanda deal was struck, there were reports that Britain was aiming for an agreement with Albania, which Mr Rama forcefully shot down. “He claimed he was strictly against this kind of treatment for refugees”, he said. “So when Albania struck the deal with Italy, there was huge speculation over what Rama was gaining personally."" Mr Karaj says there’s no ""smoking gun"": ""The government’s narrative is that Italy is our best friend and took in Albanians when our dictatorship fell in the 1990s.” The deal, Mr Karaj said, has been met only with short-lived protests by some claiming it was aimed at replacing Albanians with foreigners, or giving away territory to Italy. He suspects other countries may now come knocking on Albania’s door. “Albania needs the support it can get from the west”, he said. “If western governments like the UK or Germany see this is a solution, I don’t think Rama’s words about it just being for Italy will be that easy to sell.” The NCA says the boat continued its journey to the UK and arrived in Dover carrying about 40 people. Ms Meloni last year removed Italy from President Xi Jinping's signature Belt and Road Initiative. Michael Frison, from Chard, went missing in Sardinia on 13 July. The World Champion blamed ""losing too many kilos"" and ""irrepressible enthusiasm"" for the mishap. The bill will allow troops to open fire on migrants crossing the border when soldiers feel under threat. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

2,2024-08-02 07:37:00.000,BBC News,2024-08-02 05:36:52.000,Who are the prisoners in the Russia-West swap? ,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjjwexqj11xo,2024-08-01 21:55:11.000,"The US has confirmed 24 people were involved in a prisoner exchange between Russia and some Western countries including the US and Germany. Among the prisoners released are the US citizens Evan Gershkovich - a Wall Street Journal reporter - and former US Marine Paul Whelan. As part of the deal, Russian security service hitman Vadim Krasikov has been freed by Germany. There has been days of speculation about a major swap between Russia and Western countries, which was heightened after several prisoners were moved from their prison cells in Russian jails to unknown locations. US journalist Evan Gershkovich was sentenced to 16 years in a high-security penal colony earlier this month, after being convicted on espionage charges. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reporter was first arrested last March while on a reporting trip in the city of Yekaterinburg, about 1,600km (1,000 miles) east of Moscow, by security services. Prosecutors accused him of working for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), accusations that Mr Gershkovich, the WSJ and the US government vociferously deny. It marked the first conviction of a US journalist for espionage in Russia since the Cold War ended more than 30 years ago. After his initial arrest he was held in Moscow's notorious Lefortovo prison. Paul Whelan, 54, was given a 16-year jail sentence in 2020 after being arrested in Moscow on suspicion of spying in 2018. The ex-US Marine is a citizen of four countries - the US, Canada, the UK and Ireland. His lawyer said he was being held in a prison in the Mordovia region. After being discharged from the military in 2008 for bad conduct, he become a security consultant and started to travel back and forth to Russia for work. In December 2018, he was arrested by Russia's FSB state security agency, which claimed he had been ""caught spying"" in Moscow. His family has always denied the charges. On the same day Mr Gershkovich was convicted, Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva was sentenced to six-and-a-half years in a medium-security prison after a secret trial. She was an editor for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, which is funded by the US government, and was convicted of spreading false information about the Russian military. Her husband Pavel Butorin previously said she was arrested over a book published last year, which was a collection of stories about Russians opposed to the war in Ukraine. Ms Kurmasheva holds US and Russian citizenship and lived in Prague with her husband and two daughters. She was detained in June 2023 while visiting her mother in Russia. Vladimir Kara-Murza is a prominent Russian dissident and one of the most vocal opponents of the Putin regime, and an outspoken critic of the war in Ukraine and the internal crackdown on dissent in Russia. In 2023, the 42-year-old was sentenced to 25 years in prison for spreading ""false"" information about the Russian army and being affiliated with an ""undesirable organisation"". Mr Kara-Murza - a former journalist and politician - denied all the charges. The dual British-Russian citizen had spent his term in a prison colony in Siberia, where his wife said he developed a neurological condition as a result of being poisoned. One of Russia's most prominent opposition figures, Ilya Yashin was jailed in 2022 for ""spreading fake news"" about the country's military. He was arrested after he condemned suspected Russian war crimes in Bucha. Following the death of former opposition leader Alexei Navalny in prison, Mr Yashin said he feared for his life. He previously accused President Vladimir Putin of going “mad with power” in a series of letters from the prison in the western Smolensk region where he was being held. Oleg Orlov is a Russian human rights activist who was jailed in February for calling Russia a fascist state and criticising the war in Ukraine. He was previously the chair of the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Memorial. The 71-year-old was handed a two-and-a-half-year term for ""repeatedly discrediting"" the Russian armed forces. In an appeal aginst his sentence in July, he compared the Russian justice system to that of Nazi Germany. His sentencing followed a retrial. In the original trial in October last year, he received a 150,000 rouble fine (£1,290; $1,630) and walked free from the court. His later conviction marked a hardening of repressions against opponents of the war. Lilia Chanysheva was sentenced to nine-and-a-half years in prison earlier this year after being accused of extremism by authorities. She had served as a local coordinator with the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s anti-corruption network. Initially sentenced to seven years in 2023, prosecutors appealed against the sentence and told officials it was too lenient. She was most recently held at a centre in the Perm region. Ms Chanysheva was the first of Mr Navalny’s allies sentenced on the charge. Most of his other activists have fled Russia into exile. Ksenia Fadeyeva was sentenced to nine years in prison by authorities after she was accused of organising an extremist group. She had been a local organiser with Alexei Navalny’s anti-corruption foundation in the Siberian city of Tomsk, where she was subsequently detained. Her lawyers argued that she had ended her association with the organisation before it was designated an extremist group in 2021. Most of Mr Navalny’s former staff and allies have been forced to flee Russia into exile in recent years, as the Kremlin has ramped up repression of opposition groups. Sasha Skochilenko was sentenced to seven years in a penal colony for replacing supermarket pricing labels with anti-war messages in November as a form of protest. The replacement labels drew attention to civilian deaths in Mariupol and said Russia had become a ""fascist state"". The artist from St Petersburg had been held in a detention centre in the city since April 2023. German-Russian citizen Kevin Lik was convicted of treason as a teenager, becoming the youngest person ever to be found guilty of the crime. He grew up in Germany and moved to Russia when he was 12. Authorities sentenced him to four years in prison last December for supposedly emailing pictures to “representatives of a foreign state” prior to and throughout Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The court claimed he had visited and photographed “deployment sites” of Russian troops. German national Rico Krieger was accused of planting explosives in Belarus and sentenced to death, before being pardoned by the country’s leader Alexander Lukashenko earlier this week. In a heavily choreographed interview on state-controlled media, he said he was acting on instruction from Ukraine, but no evidence was given. He is believed to have been the first Western citizen ever to be given the death penalty in Belarus. Russian opposition activist Andrei Pivovarov headed the Open Russia foundation, which was established by former oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who spent a decade in prison for campaigning against Mr Putin. He was arrested in 2021 after trying to leave the country from St Petersburg, accused of directing an “undesirable organisation”. Russian-German citizen Voronin was sentenced to 13 years in prison on ""treason"" charges after Moscow alleged he received classified military information from another journalist, Ivan Safronov, who remains behind bars, AFP reported. Other German citizens released by Russia were: One of the most high-profile prisoners to be released back to Russia is Federal Security Service (FSB) agent Vadim Krasikov, who was serving a life sentence in Germany for the 2019 murder of an exiled Chechen commander in a Berlin park. During his trial, prosecutors said he was acting on orders from Russia, and that he belonged to a highly secretive Vympel unit of the FSB. Lawyers defending him insisted he was a construction worker, not a hitman. He denied being known as Krasikov, and identified himself as Vadim Sokolov, the name on the passport he was travelling with. In a recent interview with US talk show host Tucker Carlson, Mr Putin hinted his country was seeking “patriot” Krasikov’s release in exchange for US journalist Evan Gershkovich. Roman Seleznev was found guilty of running a hacking scheme in 2017 that caused $169m (£131m) in damages. US officials said he stole credit card data from restaurants, and sold it on the black market. He was sentenced to 27 years in prison for the scheme, which prosecutors say he ran between 2009 and 2013. According to the Justice Department, Mr Seleznev used software which enabled him to steal millions of credit card numbers from thousands of businesses. His father is Valery Seleznev, an MP and ally of Mr Putin. The US charged Vadim Konoshchenok with conspiracy related to procurement and money laundering on behalf of the Russian government in 2022. He was also thought to have been an FSB agent. At the time, a statement from the US Department of Justice said he and others unlawfully purchased and exported highly sensitive electronic components, some of which can be used for military purposes. Husband and wife Artem Viktorovich Dultsev and Anna Valerevna Dultseva were arrested and convicted on espionage charges in Slovenia. They were each sentenced to 19 months in prison. Their two children also returned to Russia with them. University lecturer Mikhail Valeryevich Mikushin was charged with gathering intelligence in Norway on behalf of Russia in 2022 while posing as a Brazilian academic. Norwegian officials said he had a Brazilian passport and had worked as a researcher at the University of Tromso since 2021. He had reportedly been going by the name José Assis Giammaria. Mr Mikushin was also believed to have lied about his age, and was in fact 44 rather than 37 when charged. Less information is publicly available about other Russians included in the exchange. Vladislav Klyushin, who was sentenced to nine years in prison in the US for insider trading, were also included. Spanish-Russian journalist Pavel Alekseyevich Rubtsov was arrested in Poland in February 2022, shortly before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Polish authorities accused him of using his freelance journalism work as cover for intelligence activities. This story will be updated as the names of more released prisoners are confirmed The BBC’s Sarah Rainsford recalls phone conversations with the ex-US marine while he was imprisoned in Russia. Some 16 prisoners were released by Russia, including US citizens Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan. The president is using his final months in office to take a victory lap after weeks of personal and political turmoil. Americans Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan are shown being escorted by officers at an undisclosed location. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two accomplices will plead guilty in Guantanamo Bay trial, say US prosecutors. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

2,2024-08-02 07:37:00.000,BBC News,2024-08-02 05:36:52.000,Maduro manoeuvring to stay in power in Venezuela,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyj439myd1jo,2024-08-01 17:43:54.000,"There is turmoil in Venezuela following the announcement by a government-controlled electoral authority of a disputed election result that handed a third consecutive term in power to President Nicolás Maduro. The opposition says the result is fraudulent and that its candidate, Edmundo González, won the election by a wide margin. The National Electoral Council (CNE), which announced the contested result, has so far failed to provide the voting tallies from individual polling stations that the opposition says demonstrate Mr González is the winner. With pressure on the CNE growing to release the tallies, Mr Maduro has turned to Venezuela's top court. The move has caused concern. Here we explain why. Venezuela has an electronic voting system. Voters punch in a button assigned to their preferred candidate on a voting machine. Once the button is pressed, the machine also prints out a paper receipt. Voters place that receipt in a ballot box. Once polling stations close, the counting begins. Each voting machine prints out a summary of all the votes cast by voters who used that particular machine. Additionally, a count of the paper receipts is also conducted at each individual polling station to confirm the machine's printout is correct. By law, this process is public and anyone can witness it. There are also a number of accredited witnesses representing the different parties. Once the chair of the count and the accredited witnesses are satisfied that the numbers match, they sign the tally and it is sent electronically to the CNE. Accredited witnesses are handed a copy and paper printouts of the tallies are also transported to the CNE by the military. Out of the five members who make up Venezuela's National Electoral Council (CNE), three are staunch government allies. Its president, Elvis Amoroso, used to work as Mr Maduro's legal counsel. Fearing the CNE could tamper with the election results, the opposition got thousands of people to act as its official witnesses and - in addition - urged Venezuelan citizens to go to their polling stations to monitor the vote count. Just after midnight on election night, the CNE announced its first partial results. It said that with 80% of the votes counted, President Maduro had 5.15m votes compared to 4.44m votes for Mr González. CNE President Elvis Amoroso said that those figures meant that Mr Maduro had ""a convincing and irreversible lead"" with 51.2%, and that the opposition trailed with 44.2%. The opposition quickly contested those results. Its witnesses had provided it with copies of the voting tallies from polling stations across the country. Just hours after the election, opposition leader María Corina Machado announced that having seen 40% of the voting tallies, they could confirm that it was their candidate, not Mr Maduro who was in the lead. In the days following the election, the share of voting tallies the opposition has received has risen to 84%. The opposition says that those tallies show that Mr González won with 67% of the vote. Opposition campaigners have shared them with international organisations and independent researchers and uploaded them onto a website which Venezuelans can access by entering their ID number. They have also urged the CNE to make all the tallies public, arguing that they will show that the Maduro win which the electoral authority announced on election night was fraudulent. Latin American leaders, including left-wing leaders from Colombia and Brazil, have joined the US, the European Union and independent election observers in increasingly forceful demands for the CNE to finally release these tallies. On Wednesday, three days after the election, President Maduro said his coalition was ""ready to present 100% of the voting tallies that are in our hands"". He made the announcement at the Supreme Tribunal of Justice (TSJ), Venezuela's highest court. He had earlier blamed the CNE's delay in publishing the tallies on ""an unprecedented cyber attack"", which he alleged had disrupted the transmission of the tallies from the polling stations. But instead of making the tallies public, he took the unusual step of filing a ""writ of amparo"" - a legal move normally used by citizens who think their constitutional rights have been violated. He asked the top court to audit the voting tallies with a view to confirming the results provided by the CNE which handed him another six-year term in power. Mr Maduro's statement may look like he is bowing to pressure for the tallies to be made public. But by resorting to the top court, he has found a way to both deflect attention away from the CNE and to delay the publication of the tallies in one swoop. The ball is now in the court of the Supreme Tribunal (TSJ), whose justices are overwhelmingly government loyalists. The proceedings there are likely to be conducted behind closed doors, in which case even if Mr Maduro provides the tallies, only the justices will be able to access them. In the short term, this deflects the pressure from the CNE and also allows Mr Maduro to argue that he has complied with international requests to hand over the tallies. And in the medium term, should the court rule in his favour, he will hope this endorsement bolsters his claim that he is the winner of the election. However, this move has already been dismissed by independent bodies, including the Carter Center, which was invited by the Maduro government to observe the election. Jennie K. Lincoln, who led the Carter Center delegation, told AP news agency that the TSJ is ""another government institution, appointed by the government, to verify the government numbers for the election results, which are in question"". ""This is not an independent assessment."" This is not the first time that a Maduro electoral victory has been denounced as fraudulent. The 2018 election was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair after opposition candidates were jailed, barred from running or forced into exile. And it is not just the CNE's result of the 2024 election which has been questioned. The Carter Center, which has monitored more than 100 elections around the globe, cited a long list of problems with the electoral process, including: It concluded that the 2024 presidential election ""cannot be considered democratic"".   Jordan Goudreau, 48, allegedly sent weapons, ammunition and other gear without a US export licence. The opposition says it has proof President Maduro's victory claim is fraudulent; his defence minster has warned of a ""coup"".

2,2024-08-02 07:37:00.000,BBC News,2024-08-02 05:36:52.000,Witness to Titan sub tragedy tells of fear and false hope,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw8y28zvvvwo,2024-07-31 23:41:35.000,"A witness to the Titan submersible disaster has told BBC News about the fear and false hope felt by those on its support ship. Rory Golden was on the Oceangate expedition when contact with the sub and its five passengers was lost on a dive to the Titanic in June 2023. “We had this image in our heads of them being down there, running out of oxygen in the freezing cold, getting terribly frightened and scared,” he said. But after learning the sub had imploded just hours into the dive, he said it was a comfort to know those onboard hadn’t suffered. Mr Golden was on the Polar Prince support ship to give presentations about the Titanic when the submersible went missing. “When the sub was overdue we weren't unduly concerned because communications break down a lot in the ocean,” he explained. “But when the alarm was finally raised, that's when we realised that there were some serious issues.” A major search and rescue operation was launched by the US Coast Guard. A few days in, underwater sounds detected by search aircraft raised hopes that these were coming from the missing sub. But it's now known that those onboard most likely died instantly after Titan suffered a catastrophic failure as it neared the Titanic at the bottom of the Atlantic. “We lived in false hope for four days,” Mr Golden said. “There’s still a lot of questions to be answered.” Those who perished were British explorer Hamish Harding, the British-Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman, Stockton Rush, the CEO of Oceangate, and French diver Paul Henri - or PH - Nargeolet. Rory Golden was a close friend of PH - a veteran deep sea explorer. He is now on the first expedition to the Titanic since the tragedy - an expedition that PH Nargeolet was supposed to be leading. A plaque is being laid in his honour at the wreck site and a memorial service for all those who died on the sub has been held at sea. Mr Golden told the BBC he was one of the last people to see PH alive. “He left the ship in great spirits, in great form and he was happy. He was going somewhere that he wanted to be.” Rory Golden had also visited the Titanic on the Oceangate sub. ”PH and I had discussed the submersible in the past and I had actually made a dive in it myself the year before,” he said. “And I'm here - as are many others. The Titan sub had made 15 dives to the Titanic up to that point, so it had worked. “I was comfortable, I spent 12 hours at the Titanic and it was a whole different experience being in a submersible that I could actually move around quite well in.” He told the BBC that he didn’t regret his dive at all. “It wasn't my time,” he said. “You never know when your time is going to come. And that certainly brought that home to all of us.” The discovery of the wreckage of Titan four days after it went missing confirmed the fate of those onboard. “We all cried when the remains were found of the sub,” he said. “A special bond has been formed between all of us who were there on the ship that week. And that's a bond that will always be there.” Industry experts had raised many serious questions about the safety of the Titan submersible prior to the dive. Investigations by the US Coast Guard and Canadian Coast Guard are still ongoing. They are likely to call for changes to ensure such a tragedy doesn’t happen again. A new expedition aims to document the world's most famous shipwreck in unprecedented detail. Graham Padden from Southport had a place booked but was unable to raise the money needed in time. The private submersible industry was shaken after the implosion of the OceanGate Titan sub last year. . Mary Roberts survived both the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 and the Rohilla in 1914.

2,2024-08-02 07:37:00.000,BBC News,2024-08-02 05:36:52.000,Kenya rolls out poison in bid to cull a million crows,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c999n2nyvwlo,2024-08-01 06:43:48.000,"""Invasive alien birds"" sounds like the strapline to a scary Hollywood blockbuster but for the people of coastal Kenya it is not a matter of fiction. The authorities there are so worried about the nuisance created by Indian house crows that they have begun the process of culling a million of them. They have not targeted humans, as in the Alfred Hitchock horror film The Birds, but these ones have for decades caused widespread disruption, by preying on wildlife, raiding tourist areas and attacking poultry farms. Poison is now being used in the towns of Watamu and Malindi to kill the first tranche of the ruthless sub-species. This ambitious poisoning campaign is aimed at halting the crows’ advance towards the capital, Nairobi. The birds, known on the coast as ""kunguru"" or ""kurabu"", originated from India and other parts of Asia, often spreading elsewhere by travelling on trading ships. But they are believed to have been intentionally introduced in East Africa around 1890s in a bid to tackle a mounting waste problem on the Zanzibar archipelago, then a British protectorate. From there, they spread to the mainland and up the coast to Kenya. They were first recorded in the port of Mombasa in 1947 and since then, their numbers have exploded, thanks to the growing human population and the accompanying mounds of rubbish, which provide an ideal environment for the birds to feed and breed. They also have no natural predators. The Indian house crows, considered one of the world’s most invasive and destructive birds, have continued their northward journey. ""They prey on the indigenous species, not just birds but also mammals, reptiles - and so their impact on biodiversity is devastating,"" Jaap Gijsbertsen, a Dutch bird expert, who is visiting Kenya's Watamu area, told the BBC. Conservationists say that the crows have significantly reduced the number of small indigenous birds in the region, such as weavers and waxbills, by ripping their nests apart while targeting eggs and even chicks. ""When the population of local birds declines, the environment begins to suffer. There will be a possible increase of harmful pests and insects that the birds prey on,"" Lennox Kirao, a research scientist with conservation group A Rocha Kenya, said. They also damage crops, livestock and chickens. ""They pounce on chicks and eat them like madmen. These are not normal birds, they act wildly,"" said Eunice Katana, a resident of Takaye village in Kilifi county. They are also known to use a unique sound to communicate distress - or when they spot a prey, according to Mr Kirao. The birds have defaced houses in Mombasa by defecating on the walls and roofs, while many people shy away from sitting under tree shades for fear of being dirtied by their droppings. ""These crows rise early and interrupt our sleep with their annoying squeals and cawing,"" Mombasa resident Victor Kimuli told the BBC. Given all these issues the authorities felt they had to act and aim to halve the Indian house crow population through poisoning, which began on Tuesday. This follows months of consultations with environmental experts, conservationists, community leaders and representatives from the hotel industry, the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) said. ""We are trying to get their population down to a controllable number,"" said Mr Kirao. The culling process involves months of pre-baiting - where the birds are encouraged, through leaving meat out, to gather at various places near their roost sites. ""We then poison them after pulling together the highest number in the baiting sites,"" Eric Kinoti, an official from the A Rocha Kenya, said. An avian poison called Starlicide is so far the only known substance that has proved effective in reducing crow numbers, without affecting other birds or animals. Close to 2,000 crows were killed in 2022 during efficacy tests carried out on the poison by Little Kenya Gardens, the company licensed to import the poison, Cecilia Ruto, owner of the firm, said. ""The slow-acting poison is entirely metabolised by the crow before it dies – which means, there is little risk of secondary poisoning to any other species that feeds on the dead crow,"" Ms Ruto added. There are currently 2kg (4.4lb) of the poison in the country which is estimated to be able to kill about 20,000 crows in the ongoing eradication. But there are plans to import more from New Zealand. Its use in Kenya has, however, raised ethical concerns from animal and bird rights activists, who argue that poisoning the crows is inhumane and that alternative and non-lethal methods should be explored. “Mass poisoning is a short-term solution that does not address the root cause of the problem,” said Leonard Onyango, an environmentalist. “There is a need to look at sustainable, humane approaches to manage the crow population,” he added. But those involved in the programme emphasise the need to protect native species and ensure ecological balance. “If we do nothing now, the damage could become irreversible,” said Mr Kirao, who is involved in the culling programme. This is not the first time the government has initiated plans to control invasive bird species. The previous attempt more than 20 years ago reduced the bird population, but the government later banned the importation of Starlicide in an effort to regulate what was coming into the country. Apart from dump sites, tourist hotels have become the crows’ favourite haunt, where they flock dining areas, disrupting guests as they enjoy their meals, hotel owners have complained. “The crows have really become a big bother to guests who visit our hotels to enjoy their meals outside the tropical beaches,"" Maureen Awuor, the Kenya Association of Hotelkeepers and Caterers chairperson, said. Some hotels trap and suffocate the crows, while others have hired staff with catapults to scare them. But trapping is said to be ineffective as the birds are intelligent enough to avoid areas where they witness other crows dying or being trapped. Despite the huge numbers which are planned to be culled, the authorities feel that they have no choice, especially now that there are concerns that the crows could spread inland. The birds have been spotted in the Mtito Andei area - about 240km (150 miles) from the capital, Nairobi, conservationists say. ""My biggest fear is, if we don't do anything now, the crows will reach Nairobi. This will pose a great threat to birdlife in the country, especially at the Nairobi National Park,"" Mr Kirao said.

2,2024-08-02 07:37:00.000,BBC News,2024-08-02 05:36:52.000,Why the world's anti-doping agency feels stuck between US and China,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2gygj1d28o,2024-08-01 00:53:05.000,"The World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) says it is ""unfairly caught"" in a row between the US and China, with their geopolitical tensions spilling onto the Olympic stage. China's top swimmers have been in the spotlight after a slew of doping allegations, followed by contentious US claims that Wada was covering it up. Chinese swimmers headed to Paris were drug-tested twice as much as some other nations, which, in turn, has fuelled accusations of a conspiracy to disrupt their performance. Wada said in its statement on Tuesday that it had been caught in ""the middle of geopolitical tensions between superpowers but has no mandate to participate in that"". ""Certain individuals [in the US] are attempting to score political points purely on the basis that the athletes in question are Chinese,"" Wada head of media relations James Fitzgerald told the BBC. ""The result is that it has created distrust and division within the anti-doping system."" A trade war, geopolitical rivalries and Beijing's friendship with Russia have soured relations between the world's two largest economies. It's little surprise that some of those tensions play out in competitive sports but now they appear to be driving a harder - and harsher - wedge. Last week, Wada had said it was considering legal action against its US counterpart, Usada, over ""defamatory"" accusations. The latter had accused Wada and China's anti-doping agency, Chinada, of being among the ""dirty hands in burying positive tests and suppressing the voices of courageous whistleblowers"". US lawmakers, too, have accused Wada of failing to investigate doping allegations against Chinese swimmers properly. And on Tuesday they introduced a bill that would give the White House power to cut funding to the agency. ""When members of congress and senators are inserting themselves into the largely technical world of anti-doping, it ceases to be about scientific and legal analysis, and it drifts into the political realm,"" said Mr Fitzgerald. Wada's statement on Tuesday followed reports in the New York Times about a previously undisclosed case involving two Chinese swimmers - including one on this year’s Olympic team - who were investigated for doping. They had tested positive for a banned steroid in 2022, but they were cleared to compete. China's anti-doping agency concluded that the athletes had most likely consumed the steroid unknowingly while eating contaminated burgers. Usada accused Wada of letting China ""compete under a different set of rules, tilting the field in their favour"". But Wada defended the decision. It said the athletes’ nutritional supplements and hair tests had returned negative results, and that both swimmers also provided control samples that were negative in the days before and after the one test that was positive. It added that the two swimmers were suspended for more than a year and then their cases were closed. Their cases are part of a ""wider series of cases involving [Chinese] athletes from different sports"", the agency said, adding that, ""based on the number of cases, clearly there is an issue of contamination in several countries around the world"". In a statement in June, Wada noted that athletes who eat meat sometimes test positive for drugs if they have ingested clenbuterol, a banned substance which is used as a growth promoter for farm animals. That statement, in response to questions from the New York Times, said the agency was investigating instances of contamination in China as well as Mexico, Guatemala and other countries. The agency's boss Olivier Niggli pointed out at the time that US media had ""only asked questions about China when meat contamination is an issue in many countries"", and referred to ""attempts to politicise anti-doping"". All of this follows a bigger controversy in April, when the New York Times reported that 23 Chinese swimmers had tested positive for a performance-enhancing drug months before the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. But they were cleared to compete after Chinese officials found the results were caused by contamination. The 30-member team went on to win six medals, inlcuding three golds in Tokyo. Eleven of those who tested positive were also picked to be part of the Chinese swimming team for the Paris Olympics. US swimmer and 11-time Olympic medalist Katie Ledecky had said her confidence in anti-doping regulators was at an ""all-time low"" after the news about the 23 Chinese swimmers. Wada's investigation, however, found that it was ""not in a position to disprove the possibility that contamination"" was the source of the drug, heart medication trimetazidine (TMZ). It said the contamination theory was supported by ""the combination of the consistently low concentrations of TMZ as well as no doping pattern"" among the tested athletes. That is, their test results over several days were not consistent, veering between negative and positive. An independent investigation found that Wada did not mishandle the case or show bias towards the Chinese swimmers. The scandals upped the pressure on anti-doping officals and by the time the Chinese swimming team arrived in Paris, they were being tested far more than is standard. Since January, each of the team's 31 members have been tested, on average, 21 times by various anti-doping organisations, according to World Aquatics, which oversees water sports. In comparison, Australia's 41 swimmers have been tested an average of four times and the 46 US swimmers, an average of six times. The flurry of tests has sparked another set of allegations. The state-run Chinese newspaper the Global Times blames Western powers for ""abusing doping tests to disrupt [the] Chinese swimming team"". Speaking to the Global Times, an international politics professor in Shanghai, accused the US of dominating anti-doping rules. Shen Yi suggested that the ""relentless and unethical testing"" had disrupted the Chinese team's training, which she called a ""disgrace to the Olympics"". Chinese swimmer Qin Haiyang, who holds the world record for the 200m men's breastroke, said this testing ""proves that European and American teams feel threatened by the performances of the Chinese team in recent years"". ""Some tricks aim to disrupt our preparation rhythm and destroy our psychological defence. But we are not afraid,"" he said on Chinese social media platform Weibo. Qin, who won golds in the 50m, 100m and 200m breaststroke at the world championships last year, finished in seventh place in the men's 100m breaststroke final on Sunday. This criticism was echoed by former Chinese diving champion Gao Min who said the rigorous testing had ""disrupted our Chinese swimming team"" and called Qin's performance ""the worst in any competition over the past two years”. China's current medal tally stands at one gold, two silver and two bronze. China's “butterfly queen”, Zhang Yufei, who won a silver in the 100m event in Tokyo, was in tears over her bronze finish on Monday but said the doping tests did not have a big impact on her. While they were a ""bit annoying"", she said it was the pressure that was ""far greater"" than she had imagined.

2,2024-08-02 07:37:00.000,BBC News,2024-08-02 05:36:52.000,How a refugee Olympian found a new life in Canada,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crg4vr7kyq5o,2024-07-31 23:07:53.000,"Nigara Shaheen’s journey to becoming an Olympic judoka did not begin with judo. Instead, it began with a 30-minute karate lesson on her family’s balcony in Peshawar, Pakistan. She was 11 years old and had already been a refugee for most of her young life, having fled her native Afghanistan in 1993 with her parents as an infant, her mother carrying her as they walked two days and nights through the mountains to safety. She has faced many more obstacles to fight in the sport she loves, in between her first-ever karate lesson and competing in the Paris Olympics as part of the Refugee Olympic Team. Since 2022, the 31-year-old athlete has been living and training in Toronto. As a young student in Pakistan, Ms Shaheen faced harassment by older men on her way to the refugee school she attended, and bullying by her peers. In an essay in the Toronto Life magazine, she recalled: ""One day, an older man assaulted me and my sister. He screamed at us and pushed me to the ground. I wanted to punch and beat him, but I didn’t know how."" Her mother said she needed to learn how to defend herself. The school she attended didn't offer martial arts or other after-school activities for students - even if it had, it would often close, sometimes for weeks at a time, she told the BBC in an interview from Paris. But through her extended family, she heard about an instructor who was coaching karate at a nearby school. He couldn't train her there, but he could come to her. Soon after, Ms Shaheen was on the balcony at her aunt's home, getting coached. Her mother told her the balcony was all the family had to offer “but you can use it as much as you want”, she recalled. Not long after, Ms Shaheen was fighting in local karate tournaments. Her coach, noticing her talent and passion, suggested she try competing in judo. “I asked him ‘what’s judo? And how would I know what to do?’ He told me: ‘Just grab your opponent and throw her, that’s it,’” she said. Ms Shaheen was able to take down her first opponent in a few seconds. She had a knack for the sport. While winning felt good, it was the philosophy of judo that got her hooked. “(My first coach) said you will not learn how to get up unless you fall. As a kid, that really motivated me,” she said. It also reminded her of watching the WWE with her father, a wrestling fan, as a child. The sport gave her the confidence to find herself - and joy in her life - despite the hardships she faced as a refugee. Ms Shaheen’s coaches began to notice her talent. At one point she trained with Pakistan’s national judo team but could not compete alongside them without a Pakistani passport. In 2014, Ms Shaheen returned to Afghanistan, where she studied political science and public administration at the American University in Kabul. She also trained with the Afghani national team, were she was welcomed by her male colleagues. ""Inside the gym, we were a family, and they treated me like I was their sister,"" she wrote in Toronto Life. She continued to train and compete, and began to receive a lot of attention as a female athlete in Afghanistan - some of it unwanted. “I faced immense cyber bullying,” she told the BBC. The harassment later turned physical. “There were so many times when cars would chase us,” she said. Once, someone threw a soft drink can in her mother’s direction as she was dropping her off at practice. She left her home country again, in 2018. “I always say that I became a refugee for a second time,” she said. She moved to Russia for her master’s studies in international trade and entrepreneurship. But unlike the welcome she received at her gym in Afghanistan, she couldn't find a training partner in Russia. She spent the next year training alone - a time she has called ""the worst days"" of her career. In 2019, she was approached by an International Judo Federation member, who suggested she try out for the Refugee Olympic Team. She qualified for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, but a serious shoulder injury knocked her out of the competition. By then she had finished her studies in Russia and the situation in Afghanistan had deteriorated drastically. “I was just stuck,” Ms Shaheen said. She returned to Pakistan where she mostly stayed at home in fear of her safety - she had faced criticism for not wearing a headscarf during the Games - and contemplated her next steps. That’s when the opportunity to live and train in Canada opened up, with the help of the Olympic Refugee Foundation and United Nations Refugee Agency. Ms Shaheen was accepted to study in Toronto for a postgraduate degree in international development. She arrived in September 2022 - a bittersweet moment for the athlete who had already journeyed through three countries in search of stability. It was in that Canadian city where her judo career was given a new lease on life. “I was so happy to finally be at a place where I can be myself,” she said. “But it was also hard for me because I had to say goodbye to my parents for the second time.” In Paris, she is one of the 37 athletes playing for the Refugee Olympic Team - a team Ms Shaheen is grateful to be a part of. “I feel really proud,” she said ahead of her first competition on Tuesday against Mexico’s Prisca Awiti Alcaraz. “I’m as much of an Afghan as I am a refugee,” she said. The banner for the refugee team is “a flag that I can relate to”. While she lost to Ms Alcaraz, Ms Shaheen has said that she is thankful to be able to compete at the highest level. ""Even with every loss, I learn something new."" She will appear on the mat once again on Saturday, where she will represent the Refugee Olympic Team in the mixed team event - her first time doing so. ""Team events are more exciting since I always look at my teammates and feel like I can’t let them down so I fight for all of them,"" she told the International Judo Federation ahead of the competition. After the games, Ms Shaheen plans to call Canada home - she is now a permanent resident - and she hopes to one day work to assist refugees like herself. Her parents are still in Pakistan, where they are cheering her on as she lives out her Olympic dream. At her lowest points, she said she would lean on her family for support. “My sister used to tell me, ‘I trust that one day you will achieve something big, and this will be a memory and you will laugh about this.’” “Now is the time that I laugh about it.” Sir Keir Starmer and First Minister John Swinney were among the tributes to the tennis star.

1,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-03 04:52:58.000,Markets digest bank earnings after recent turmoil,https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/stock-market-bank-earnings/index.html,2023-04-14 20:00:28.000,"Our live coverage for the day has ended. Follow the latest business news here or read through the updates below. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm, slashed Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink’s pay by 30% to $25.2 million for 2022, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The move comes after the money manager reported first-quarter revenue that was down 10% from a year ago, as rising interest rates and economic uncertainty impacted the firm’s bottom line. “With respect to 2022 compensation, management determined to reduce the impact of the firm’s decline in profitability on BlackRock’s broader employee population by concentrating the downward adjustments to total incentive awards toward senior management,” the filing said. Total compensation for Fink, 70, included a base salary of $1.5 million and $23.7 million in total incentive awards. Several other executives saw their compensation reduced, including Rob Kapito, the firm’s president, whose package shrank by 34% to $18.95 million. UBS’ purchase of Credit Suisse’s US subsidiaries can move forward, the Federal Reserve said Friday. The statement comes a month after UBS stepped in to rescue the embattled Swiss lender and prevent turmoil in the financial sector from spreading, after an emergency loan of nearly $54 billion from the Swiss National Bank failed to stop the carnage. The problems for Credit Suisse began when the Saudi National Bank, its largest backer, said it wouldn’t put up more cash after buying a nearly 10% stake in the bank for $1.5 billion in 2022. Banking customers were already on edge after the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank — so Credit Suisse shares tumbled more than 25% and saw billions of dollars of outflows. The global turmoil has led US lawmakers to call for tighter regulations on banks. The Fed board said UBS will provide a quarterly updated plan for combining UBS’s and Credit Suisse’s US business and operations. “The implementation plan will address UBS’s obligations to comply with more stringent enhanced prudential standards, including liquidity standards,” the Fed said in a statement. UBS is shelling out 3 billion Swiss francs, or $3.25 billion, for Credit Suisse. Stocks slid Friday after a slate of earnings beats from big banks fueled concerns that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its next two meetings. Still, the major indices gained for the week. The Dow rose 400 points, or 1.2%. The S&P 500 gained 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.3%. JPMorgan Chase on Friday reported first-quarter profit and revenue that crushed expectations, boosted by the Fed’s interest rate hiking campaign. Citigroup, Wells Fargo and PNC Financial also reported strong results. CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors in the company’s post-earnings conference call that they should prepare for interest rates to be higher for longer than expected. Wall Street seems to have taken note. Analysts increased their bets on a quarter-point rate hike at the Fed’s meeting in May and another in June. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Friday that the central bank needs to continue tightening monetary policy, further weighing down markets. Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said that it’s “definitely” possible the United States enters a mild recession after the tumult in banking last month. Meanwhile, retail sales data declined more than expected, suggesting that Americans’ spending power and the US economy are weakening. Consumer sentiment held fairly steady in April, even as concerns about a recession linger, according to the University of Michigan’s latest monthly survey. “There was too much news to digest this morning, but the key takeaway is that the Fed has room to do more harm,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, said in a note. The Dow slipped 144 points, or 0.4%. The S&P 500 tumbled 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite sank 0.4%. As stocks settle after the trading day, levels might still change slightly. Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said Friday he isn’t discounting the recent assessment from central bank economists that the banking crisis will tip the United States into a mild recession later this year. “There’s no way you can look at current conditions around the world and in the US and not think that some mild recession is definitely on the table as a possibility,” Goolsbee said Friday during an interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” He added that, when viewed historically, the monetary tightening campaign undertaken by the Fed — hiking interest rates nine times in just over a year — is expected to slow GDP growth. “When you get numbers like retail sales and others that are declining, if you look at construction, I think we’ve got to think about what’s the state of growth in the country,” he said. “Fortunately, the labor market continues to be very strong.” Critics have lambasted the World Bank and, particularly, the International Monetary Fund, for predicting Russia’s economy would hold relatively stable this year despite international sanctions. But sanctions are hurting Russia’s economy, even if World Bank forecasts don’t reflect it, according to the outgoing World Bank President David Malpass. Speaking to Julia Chatterley at the IMF-World Bank spring conference, David Malpass responded to criticism that you couldn’t trust GDP and economic data from Russia. He admitted “the quality of the data differs substantially by country…the reality is there’s not very much in terms of double checking of data”. In January, the IMF projected that Russia’s economy would expand by 0.3% this year and 2.1% the next. That was much more optimistic than the latest forecasts from the World Bank, which still penciled in a contraction of just 3.3% this year. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development was the most pessimistic, forecasting a 5.6% contraction in Russia’s economy in 2023. Malpass said that GDP numbers were not capturing the “reality” and “horror” of the war, and noted the Russian economy was suffering. “I think life is hard in Russia…they’re excluded from travelling to many parts of the world, their supply chains have to change dramatically… young people moving out because they don’t want to be part of this war,” Malpass said. Consumer sentiment tracked by the University of Michigan held steady in April, according to a preliminary reading released Friday. So far, the university’s monthly surveys have shown a limited impact from the banking crisis on consumers’ attitudes, but Americans remain concerned about an upcoming recession and some lingering fears about inflation persist. “Consumers are expecting a downturn, they’re not feeling as dismal as they were last summer, but they’re waiting for the other shoe to drop,” said Joanne Hsu, director of the surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan, in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Friday morning. “We now have about a month of data following the collapse of SVB, and there hasn’t really been much of an effect on sentiment at all,” she said. The latest survey also showed that higher gas prices helped push up year-ahead inflation expectations by a full percentage point, rising from 3.6% in March to 4.6% in April. “Consumers are still feeling the pain of high prices,” Hsu told Bloomberg, noting that survey respondents were now mentioning gas prices for the first time since fall. The latest cooldown in consumer and producer price hikes as well as the latest decline in retail sales are indications that the Federal Reserve’s efforts are working to bring down high inflation, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee told CNBC on Friday. “You don’t want to overreact to short-run news, but it feel likes like that’s moving in the right direction,” he said during an appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” Goolsbee was quick to note that an area of critical importance to him in advance of the next Fed meeting is activity in banking and credit. Earlier this week, Goolsbee noted that the Fed needs to be “on watch” for tighter credit conditions as a result of the banking turmoil last month. He referenced private sector analyst estimates that the spillover effects of the crisis equate to the Fed enacting rate hikes anywhere from a quarter point to three-quarters of a point. “I’m an old-school data dog,” Goolsbee said Friday. “What I would do is spend the next three weeks getting out and figuring out how much credit tightening is coming.” Chief executives at some of the largest banks in the United States were forced to address the elephant in the room as they reported first-quarter earnings on Friday morning: The regional banking crisis that brought Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank to ruin last month. > Banking industry turmoil has added to risks of recessionary “storm clouds” on the horizon, said JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon Friday in a release. He added that “the banking situation is distinct from 2008 as it has involved far fewer financial players and fewer issues that need to be resolved.” Still, said Dimon, who leads the country’s largest bank, “financial conditions will likely tighten as lenders become more conservative, and we do not know if this will slow consumer spending.” >“We are glad to have been in a strong position to help support the US financial system during the recent events that impacted the banking industry,” commented Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf in a statement. “Regional and community banks are an important part of our financial system and are uniquely positioned to serve their customers and communities.” > “I believe today’s crisis of confidence in the regional banking sector will further accelerate capital markets growth, and BlackRock will be a central player,” wrote BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on Friday. “Increased financing through the capital markets will require the scale, multi-asset capabilities and excellence in portfolio construction that BlackRock consistently delivers across market cycles,” he said in a statement. That means bad news for regional banks could be good news for BlackRock – the lack of trust in regional banks will drive more investment into capital markets and BlackRock is poised to benefit as that happens. “Throughout our history, moments of market dislocation and disruption have served as inflection points for BlackRock,” he explained. Regulators also hired BlackRock in early April to help the US government in the sale of the $114 billion in assets it collected from the collapse> Citigroup and PNC did not address the banking crisis in their releases, but will likely answer questions about how they’ve weathered the turmoil and what they see ahead at their first-quarter presentations, planned for 11 a.m. ET. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors Friday not to be caught unawares if interest rates stay higher longer than expected. “People need to be prepared. They shouldn’t pray that they don’t go up. They should prepare for them going up. And if it doesn’t happen, serendipity,” Dimon said on the company’s post-earnings conference call. High interest rates have helped big banks, including JPMorgan Chase, since they widen the gap between the interest paid to customers and what they earn from investing that money. But climbing rates also helped drive last month’s collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which held 55% of its customers deposits in long-dated bonds whose value diminished as interest rates rose. Dimon stated that he believes the banking crisis will pass — even though he expects its effects to reverberate through the sector for years to come — but that the possibility of higher interest rates should remain on companies’ radars. “If and when that happens, it will address problems in the economy. For those who are too exposed to floating rates, or those who are too exposed to [refinancing] risk, those exposures will be in multiple parts of the economy,” Dimon said. “Now would be the time to fix it. Do not put yourself in a position where that risk is excessive for your company, your business, your investment pools,” he said. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the largest US bank, told investors Friday that he isn’t too worried about a credit crunch resulting from the recent banking crisis. “I wouldn’t use the word[s] ‘credit crunch,’” he said in response to a question about whether he was worried that lending would tighten in the bank after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. There will be “a little bit of tightening,” said Dimon, but that will mostly be contained within the real estate market. Dimon added that he’s more worried about recession than a credit crunch. “I just look at it as a kind of a thumb on the scale. It just makes the financing conditions a little bit tighter and increases the odds of a recession,” he said. “That’s what that is. It’s not like a credit crunch.” JPMorgan Chase said Friday its exposure to the office sector is limited, addressing concerns about the commercial real estate industry’s stability. “Given the recent focus on commercial real estate, let me remind you that our office sector exposure is less than 10% of our portfolio and is focused in urban dense markets, and nearly two-thirds of our loans are multifamily, primarily in supply-constrained markets,” said Jeremy Barnum, chief financial officer, in the company’s post-earnings conference call. Investors and regulators are watching the $20 trillion US commercial real estate market for signs that it could be the next shoe to drop after the banking tumult last month. That’s partly because the value of buildings is going down, particularly as offices in major cities remain vacant or half-empty as Americans opt to work from home. The commercial real estate industry’s woes come after decades of unbridled growth powered by low interest rates and easy credit. That upward trend was interrupted by the Covid pandemic’s onset, and then when the Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates aggressively last year to stabilize the economy. “There are obviously some big things here and there to pay attention to, but in the scheme of things for us, not a big issue,” Barnum said. Spending at US retailers fell in March as consumers pulled back amid recessionary fears fueled by the banking crisis. Retail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation, fell by 1% in March from the prior month, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. That was steeper than an expected 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv, and above the revised 0.2% decline in the prior month. The drop was driven by a pullback in spending at department stores and on durable goods such as appliances and furniture. Spending at general merchandise stores fell 3% in March from the prior month and spending at gas stations declined 5.5% during the same period. Excluding gas station sales, retail spending retreated 0.6% in March from February. However, year-on-year retail spending rose 2.9%. Citigroup shares were up about 0.8% in premarket trading after the bank posted strong first-quarter profits, beating analyst expectations for both earnings per share and revenue. The bank brought in $21.4 billion in revenue versus expectations of $19.9 billion. Earnings per share were $2.19, estimates were for $1.67. Citi CEO Jane Fraser and CFO Mark Mason will hold an earnings presentation at 11 a.m. ET. Stocks slid Friday, even as big banks reported beats on their first-quarter earnings in an auspicious start to earnings season. Investors were watching for clues about the financial sector’s stability, and whether the tumult in the sector last month could lead to tighter lending standards. A key point of interest was also how much big banks benefitted from increased deposit inflows when nervous customers fled from regional banks after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. JPMorgan, the largest bank in the United States and an economic bellwether, posted record revenue. Wells Fargo, Citigroup and PNC Financial Services also reported earnings beats. Shares of JPMorgan Chase gained 4.8%, Wells Fargo rose 0.7%, Citigroup added 1.9% and PNC Financial Services ticked up 0.3%. Meanwhile, retail sales came in weaker than expected as recession fears loom. Retail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation, fell by 1% in March from the month before, according to the Commerce Department. Economists expected a 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv. The Dow fell 38 points, or about 0.1%. The S&P 500 sank 0.1%. The Nasdaq Composite declined 0.5%. The Federal Reserve could end its historic rate-hiking campaign after just one more quarter-point increase, said Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic in a Thursday interview with Reuters. The Fed has approved nine rate hikes in a row since last March, the effects of which are only now starting to “bite,” Bostic said. Monetary policy can take months to trickle through the economy, but a slew of recent data suggests that inflation is finally cooling. The March Consumer Price Index shows price hikes have slowed for nine months in a row, and headline wholesale inflation reflected in the Producer Price Index has sunk to 2.7% after reaching double digit highs last year. Bostic said the recent “chaos” in the banking sector, after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, persuaded him to rethink the pace of rate hikes. However, he told Reuters he believes the turmoil will not have any lasting impact on the the US economy. Analysts expect the Fed to raise rates by a quarter point at its upcoming policy meeting on May 2-3, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Regional bank PNC Financial reported first-quarter revenue of $5.6 billion and earnings per share of $3.98 vs. expectations of $3.66. Shares rose 5% on the news. Wells Fargo reported first-quarter revenue of $20.7 billion against expectations of $20.1 billion. The San Francisco-based bank saw earnings of $4.9 billion, up from $3.8 billion a year earlier, an increase of about 32%. Shares of Wells Fargo rose 2.2%. JPMorgan Chase on Friday reported first-quarter profit and revenue that roundly beat expectations, boosted by a year of rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. The New York-based bank posted a profit of $12.6 billion or $4.10 per share. That’s up from $8.3 billion, or $2.63 per share from the same period a year before. Analysts expected earnings of $3.41 per share, according to Refinitiv. With $3.67 trillion in assets, JPMorgan Chase is the largest bank in the United States and a bellwether for the US economy. “The US economy continues to be on generally healthy footings — consumers are still spending and have strong balance sheets, and businesses are in good shape. However, the storm clouds that we have been monitoring for the past year remain on the horizon,” CEO Jamie Dimon said in a press release. Net interest income rose to $20.8 billion, up 49% from the prior year, driven by the aggressive interest rate campaign the Fed kicked off last year to stabilize prices. Deposits rose to $2.38 trillion during the first quarter from $2.34 trillion in the quarter ended in December. That comes after the banking tumult last month triggered a rush into big banks from nervous customers. Investors also looked to money market funds as a haven. A key point of conversation after last month’s turmoil in the banking sector has been whether banks could tighten lending standards, leading customers to spend less as it becomes more difficult to borrow money for large purchases like homes and cars. “Financial conditions will likely tighten as lenders become more conservative, and we do not know if this will slow consumer spending,” Dimon said, adding that JPMorgan Chase is “confident that we can serve the needs of our customers and clients in all environments.” Shares of JPMorgan Chase climbed 6.1% in pre-market trading. The company’s post-earnings conference call is slated for 8:30 a.m. ET. Stocks: US stock futures fell ahead of several bank earnings this morning. Investors also fretted a retail sales report that is expected to show consumers are pulling back on their spending. Dow futures were down 75 points, or 0.2%. S&P 500 futures fell 0.2%. Nasdaq futures were 0.4% lower. European stocks were higher and Asian stocks closed up. Fear & Greed Index: 67 = Greed Oil & gas: US oil prices were up 0.3% to $82 a barrel. Average US gas prices rose to $3.66 a gallon. Wall Street is searching for answers to two key questions: Is the economy headed for a recession? And, if so, who’s poised to weather it? Recession fears have ramped up in recent weeks after the banking tumult last month raised concerns about the financial sector’s health. Earnings season for banks starts on Friday with JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, BlackRock, Citigroup and PNC Financial Services slated to report before the bell. Investors will be watching for clues about stability. Stocks have yet to price in the economy’s precarious position, with the S&P 500 adding about 7% this year. But markets have already seen volatile trading since then. “We’re going to see a correction happen here, because it just never makes sense when the market’s going up and earnings are going down,” says Eric Sterner, chief investment officer at Apollon Wealth Management. But while earnings are an undeniable factor driving markets, inflation remains a key concern. Wall Street remains overly optimistic that the Fed will cut rates later this year — even after officials indicated last month that they likely won’t — or that it could even orchestrate a soft landing. That hope, and the market’s resilience, could start to crumble in the next few weeks, said Megan Horneman, chief investment officer at Verdence Capital Advisors. “You very well could see that catalyst over the next couple of weeks with earnings, and then this inflation data and then what the Fed says when they meet,” said Horneman. Jeremy Grantham made his name predicting the dot-com crash in 2000 and the financial crisis in 2008. Now, the famous investor warns another epic bubble in financial markets is bursting — and the turmoil that swept through the banking sector last month is just the beginning. “Other things will break, and who knows what they will be,” Grantham told CNN in an exclusive interview. “We’re by no means finished with the stress to the financial system.” Since early 2022, when the S&P 500 hit an all-time high, US stocks have dropped about 15% as central banks have jacked up borrowing costs. But Grantham sees much steeper declines on the horizon. The “best we can hope for,” he said, is a fall of about 27% from current levels, while the worst-case scenario would see a plunge of more than 50%. The low point might not arrive until “deep into next year,” he added. Grantham sees uncomfortable parallels between markets today and 2000, when an explosion in the price of tech stocks was followed by a dizzying crash. There are also echoes of 2008, when a painful comedown in the US housing market almost broke the banking system. What’s even more worrying is that this time, bubbles in the stock market and the real estate market are poised to burst simultaneously, Grantham said. The broader US banking system remains sound and stable, but the two regional banks that failed were “poorly managed” and “took unacceptable risks,” White House economic adviser Lael Brainard told CNN’s Poppy Harlow in an interview Wednesday at Semafor’s World Economy Summit in Washington, DC. Last month’s collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank roiled markets and spread fear through the economy of a possible wider banking crisis. The US Treasury, Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation all intervened to ensure bank customers could access all their money and to attempt to stave off future bank runs. “The banking system, it’s very sound, it’s stable; the core of the banking system has a great deal of capital that was put in place in the wake of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis,” said Brainard, director of the White House National Economic Council. “There were some banks who were not managing their risks effectively. They failed, and the president took strong actions along with the Secretary of the Treasury and the banking regulators,” she said. “Those actions reassured Americans their deposits are safe, the banking system is sound; but it was also important to the president that the executives of those failed banks were held accountable and, very important, that taxpayer money not be at risk,” she continued. Before its collapse last month, Silicon Valley Bank was known to investors of color as a place that fostered a community of minority entrepreneurs and provided them with both social and financial capital. SVB regularly sponsored conferences and networking events for minority entrepreneurs, and it was well known for funding the annual State of Black Venture Report spearheaded by BLK VC, a nonprofit organization that connects and empowers Black investors. “When other banks were saying no, SVB would say yes,” said Joynicole Martinez, a 25-year entrepreneur and chief advancement and innovation officer for Rising Tide Capital, a nonprofit organization founded in 2004 to connect entrepreneurs with investors and mentors. Minority business owners have long faced challenges accessing capital due to discriminatory lending practices, experts say. Data from the Small Business Credit Survey, a collaboration of all 12 Federal Reserve banks, shows disparities on denial rates for bank and nonbank loans. In 2021, about 16% of Black-led companies acquired the total amount of business financing they sought from banks, compared to 35% of White-owned companies, the survey shows. “We know there’s historic, systemic, and just blatant racism that’s inherent in lending and banking. We have to start there and not tip-toe around it,” Martinez told CNN. The Financial Services Forum, an organization representing the eight largest financial institutions in the United States has said banks have committed millions of dollars since 2020 to address economic and racial inequality.

1,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-03 04:52:58.000,Still haven't filed your taxes? Here's what you need to know,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/13/success/tax-filing-tips/index.html,2023-04-14 20:07:40.000,"Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks So far this tax season, the IRS has received more than 100 million income tax returns for 2022. That means tens of millions of households have yet to file their returns. If yours is among them, here are some last-minute tax-filing tips to keep in mind as the Tuesday, April 18 deadline approaches. Not everyone has to file on April 18: If you live in a federally declared disaster area, have a business there — or have relevant tax documents stored by businesses in that area — it’s likely the IRS has already extended the filing and payment deadlines for you. Here is where you can find the specific extension dates for each disaster area. Thanks to many rounds of extreme weather in recent months, for instance, tax filers in most of California — which accounts for 10% to 15% of all federal filers — have already been granted an extension until Oct. 16 to file and to pay, according to an IRS spokesperson. If you’re in the armed forces and are currently or were recently stationed in a combat zone, the filing and payment deadlines for your 2022 taxes are most likely extended by 180 days. But your specific extended filing and payment deadlines will depend on the day you leave (or left) the combat zone. This IRS publication offers more detail. Taxes and adulting: What to know about filing taxes on your own for the first time Lastly, if you made little to no money last year (typically less than $12,950 for single filers and $25,900 for married couples), you may not be required to file a return. But you may want to anyway if you think you are eligible for a refund thanks to, for instance, refundable tax credits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit. (Use this IRS tool to gauge whether you are required to file this year.) You also are likely eligible to use IRS Free File (intended for those with adjusted gross income of $73,000 or less) so it won’t cost you to submit a return. Your paycheck may not be your only source of income: If you had one full-time job you may think that is the only income you made and have to report. But that’s not necessarily so. Other potentially taxable and reportable income sources include: Organize your tax documents: By now you should have received every tax document that third parties are required to send you (your employer, bank, brokerage, etc.). If you don’t recall receiving a hard copy of a tax form in the mail, check your email and your online accounts — a document may have been sent to you electronically. Here are some of the tax forms you may have received: “Be aware that there’s no form for some taxable income, like proceeds from renting out your vacation property, meaning you’re responsible for reporting it on your own,” according to the Illinois CPA Society. One very last-minute way to reduce your 2022 tax bill: If you’re eligible to make a tax-deductible contribution to an IRA and haven’t done so for last year, you have until April 18 to contribute up to $6,000 ($7,000 if you’re 50 or older). That will reduce your tax bill and augment your retirement savings. Proofread your return before submitting it: Do this whether you’re using tax software or working with a professional tax preparer. Little mistakes and oversights delay the processing of your return (and the issuance of your refund if you’re owed one). You want to avoid things like having a typo in your name, birth date, Social Security number or direct deposit number; choosing the wrong filing status (e.g., married vs single); making a simple math error; or leaving a required field blank. What to do if you can’t file by April 18: If you’re not able to file by next Tuesday, fill out Form 4868 electronically or on paper and send it in by April 18. You will be granted an automatic six-month extension to file. Your tax refund may be smaller this year. Here's why Note, however, that an extension to file is not an extension to pay. You will be charged interest (currently running at 7%) and a penalty on any amount you still owe for 2022 but haven’t paid by April 18. So if you suspect you still owe tax — perhaps you had some income outside of your job for which tax wasn’t withheld or you had a big capital gain last year — approximate how much more you owe and send that money to the IRS by Tuesday. You can choose to do so by mail, attaching a check to your extension request form. Make sure your envelope is postmarked no later than April 18. Or the more efficient route is pay what you owe electronically at IRS.gov, said CPA Damien Martin, a tax partner at EY. If you do that, the IRS notes you will not have to file a Form 4868. “The IRS will automatically process an extension of time to file,” the agency notes in its instructions. If you opt to electronically pay directly from your bank account, which is free, select “extension” and then “tax year 2022” when given the option. You can also pay by credit or debit card, but you will be charged a processing fee. Doing so, though, may become much more costly than just a fee if you charge your tax payment but don’t pay your credit card bill off in full every month, since you likely pay a high interest rate on outstanding balances. If you still owe income taxes to your state, remember that you may need to go through a similar exercise of filing for an extension and making a payment to your state’s revenue department, Martin said. Use this interactive tax assistant for basic questions you may have: The IRS provides an “interactive tax assistant” that can help you answer more than 50 basic questions pertaining to your individual circumstance on income, deductions, credits and other technical questions.

1,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-03 04:52:58.000,Retail spending fell in March as consumers pull back,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/14/economy/march-retail-sales/index.html,2023-04-14 14:29:52.000,"Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Spending at US retailers fell in March as consumers pulled back after the banking crisis fueled recession fears. Retail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation, fell by 1% in March from the prior month, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. That was steeper than an expected 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv, and above the revised 0.2% decline in the prior month. Investors chalk up some of the weakness to a lack of tax returns and concerns about a slowing labor market. The IRS issued $84 billion in tax refunds this March, about $25 billion less than they issued in March of 2022, according to BofA analysts. That led consumers to pull back in spending at department stores and on durable goods, such as appliances and furniture. Spending at general merchandise stores fell 3% in March from the prior month and spending at gas stations declined 5.5% during the same period. Excluding gas station sales, retail spending retreated 0.6% in March from February. However, retail spending rose 2.9% year-over-year. Smaller tax returns likely played a role in last month’s decline in retail sales, along with the expiration of enhanced food assistance benefits, economists say. “March is a really important month for refunds. Some folks might have been expecting something similar to last year,” Aditya Bhave, senior US economist at BofA Global Research, told CNN. Credit and debit card spending per household tracked by Bank of America researchers moderated in March to its slowest pace in more than two years, which was likely the result of smaller returns and expired benefits, coupled with slowing wage growth. Enhanced pandemic-era benefits provided through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program expired in February, which might have also held back spending in March, according to a Bank of America Institute report. Average hourly earnings grew 4.2% in March from a year earlier, down from the prior month’s annualized 4.6% increase and the smallest annual rise since June 2021, according to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Employment Cost Index, a more comprehensive measure of wages, has also shown that worker pay gains have moderated this past year. ECI data for the first quarter of this year will be released later this month. Still, the US labor market remains solid, even though it has lost momentum recently. That could hold up consumer spending in the coming months, said Michelle Meyer, North America chief economist at Mastercard Economics Institute. “The big picture is still favorable for the consumer when you think about their income growth, their balance sheet and the health of the labor market,” Meyer said. Employers added 236,000 jobs in March, a robust gain by historical standards but smaller than the average monthly pace of job growth in the prior six months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The latest monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, showed that the number of available jobs remained elevated in February — but was down more than 17% from its peak of 12 million in March 2022, and revised data showed that weekly claims for US unemployment benefits were higher than previously reported. The job market could cool further in the coming months. Economists at the Federal Reserve expect the US economy to head into a recession later in the year as the lagged effects of higher interest rates take a deeper hold. Fed economists had forecast subdued growth, with risks of a recession, prior to the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. For consumers, the effects of last month’s turbulence in the banking industry have been limited so far. Consumer sentiment tracked by the University of Michigan worsened slightly in March during the bank failures, but it had already shown signs of deteriorating before then. The latest consumer sentiment reading, released Friday morning, showed that sentiment held steady in April despite the banking crisis, but that higher gas prices helped push up year-ahead inflation expectations by a full percentage point, rising from 3.6% in March to 4.6% in April. “On net, consumers did not perceive material changes in the economic environment in April,” Joanne Hsu, director of the surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan, said in a news release. “Consumers are expecting a downturn, they’re not feeling as dismal as they were last summer, but they’re waiting for the other shoe to drop,” Hsu told Bloomberg TV in an interview Friday morning.

1,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-03 04:52:58.000,Analysis: Fox News is about to enter the true No Spin Zone,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/14/media/fox-news-dominion-hnk-intl/index.html,2023-04-14 06:41:00.000,"Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks This is it. The media defamation trial of the century is on the precipice of kicking off in Wilmington, Delaware, in just days. Jury selection in Dominion Voting Systems’ monster $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit took place all of Thursday, with 300 potential jurors being summoned to court. Good progress was made and the presiding judge noted that there were “more than enough jurors” to start the trial as scheduled on Monday. It is there, in Courtroom 7E, where the biggest figures in Murdoch Media, accompanied by a throng of high-powered lawyers, will attempt to mount their defense after repeatedly failing to convince a judge to toss the now-historic case. A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. It’s, frankly, extraordinary to write those words. When I watched Fox News broadcast election lies in the aftermath of the 2020 election, never did I expect the network to be held accountable in a meaningful way. I’ve covered Fox News for a while now. I’ve watched thousands and thousands of hours of the right-wing channel’s programming. I’ve seen its hosts over the years undermine public health, make gross anti-immigrant remarks, peddle lies and propaganda and push deranged conspiracy theories that were once reserved for the right-wing’s furthest fringes. The network has always seemed to find a way to sail through the controversy, even the most hellish storms it has faced. Sometimes it has emerged even stronger and more emboldened than before. But this time is different. This time, the normal tricks the network turns to during times of crisis will not free it from trouble. This time, in a court of law, the network will need to put forward an honest, fact-driven argument. Fox News is about to enter the true No Spin Zone, where deception is strictly prohibited. Where it is not in charge. And where its top executives like Rupert Murdoch and Suzanne Scott and hosts like Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity cannot simply ignore a request for comment and resort to, instead, attacking “the media” on-air. In this setting, where lies cannot be casually told and truth cannot be distorted beyond reality to fit a dishonest narrative, it will be fascinating to see how the network fares. If the pre-trial hearings are any indicator, it won’t be pretty. The case hasn’t even started and the presiding judge has already lost his patience with Fox’s legal team and put them on notice. Perhaps the winds will shift for Fox News when the judge gavels in the trial on Monday. But if they play out like the last few weeks of court have, Fox News is in for a brutal ride.

1,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-03 04:52:58.000,Silicon Valley Bank collapse renews calls to address disparities impacting entrepreneurs of color ,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/13/business/silicon-valley-bank-entrepreneurs-of-color-reaj/index.html,2023-04-13 21:13:04.000,"Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks When customers at Silicon Valley Bank rushed to withdraw billions of dollars last month, venture capitalist Arlan Hamilton stepped in to help some of the founders of color who panicked about losing access to payroll funds. As a Black woman with nearly 10 years of business experience, Hamilton knew the options for those startup founders were limited. SVB had a reputation for servicing people from underrepresented communities like hers. Its failure has reignited concerns from industry experts about lending discrimination in the banking industry and the resulting disparities in capital for people of color. Hamilton, the 43-year-old founder and managing partner of Backstage Capital, said that when it comes to entrepreneurs of color, “we’re already in the smaller house. We already have the rickety door and the thinner walls. And so, when a tornado comes by, we’re going to get hit harder.” Established in 1983, the midsize California tech lender was America’s 16th largest bank at the end of 2022 before it collapsed on March 10. SVB provided banking services to nearly half of all venture-backed technology and life-sciences companies in the United States. Hamilton, industry experts and other investors told CNN the bank was committed to fostering a community of minority entrepreneurs and provided them with both social and financial capital. SVB regularly sponsored conferences and networking events for minority entrepreneurs, said Hamilton, and it was well known for funding the annual State of Black Venture Report spearheaded by BLK VC, a nonprofit organization that connects and empowers Black investors. “When other banks were saying no, SVB would say yes,” said Joynicole Martinez, a 25-year entrepreneur and chief advancement and innovation officer for Rising Tide Capital, a nonprofit organization founded in 2004 to connect entrepreneurs with investors and mentors. Martinez is also an official member of the Forbes Coaches Council, an invitation-only organization for business and career coaches. She said SVB was an invaluable resource for entrepreneurs of color and offered their clients discounted tech tools and research funding. Minority business owners have long faced challenges accessing capital due to discriminatory lending practices, experts say. Data from the Small Business Credit Survey, a collaboration of all 12 Federal Reserve banks, shows disparities on denial rates for bank and nonbank loans. In 2021, about 16% of Black-led companies acquired the total amount of business financing they sought from banks, compared to 35% of White-owned companies, the survey shows. “We know there’s historic, systemic, and just blatant racism that’s inherent in lending and banking. We have to start there and not tip-toe around it,” Martinez told CNN. Asya Bradley is an immigrant founder of multiple tech companies like Kinley, a financial services business aiming to help Black Americans build generational wealth. Following SVB’s collapse, Bradley said she joined a WhatsApp group of more than 1,000 immigrant business founders. Members of the group quickly mobilized to support one another, she said. Immigrant founders often don’t have Social Security numbers nor permanent addresses in the United States, Bradley said, and it was crucial to brainstorm different ways to find funding in a system that doesn’t recognize them. “The community was really special because a lot of these folks then were sharing different things that they had done to achieve success in terms of getting accounts in different places. They also were able to share different regional banks that have stood up and been like, ‘Hey, if you have accounts at SVB, we can help you guys,’” Bradley said. Many women, people of color and immigrants opt for community or regional banks like SVB, Bradley says, because they are often rejected from the “top four banks” — JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citibank. In her case, Bradley said her gender might have been an issue when she could only open a business account at one of the “top four banks” when her brother co-signed for her. “The top four don’t want our business. The top four are rejecting us consistently. The top four do not give us the service that we deserve. And that’s why we’ve gone to community banks and regional banks such as SVB,” Bradley said. None of the top four banks provided a comment to CNN. The Financial Services Forum, an organization representing the eight largest financial institutions in the United States has said the banks have committed millions of dollars since 2020 to address economic and racial inequality. Last week, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told CNN’s Poppy Harlow that his bank has 30% of its branches in lower-income neighborhoods as part of a $30 billion commitment to Black and Brown communities across the country. Wells Fargo specifically pointed to its 2022 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion report, which discusses the bank’s recent initiatives to reach underserved communities. The bank partnered last year with the Black Economic Alliance to initiate the Black Entrepreneur Fund — a $50 million seed, startup, and early-stage capital fund for businesses founded or led by Black and African American entrepreneurs. And since May 2021, Wells Fargo has invested in 13 Minority Depository Institutions, fulfilling its $50 million pledge to support Black-owned banks. Black-owned banks work to close the lending gap and foster economic empowerment in these traditionally excluded communities, but their numbers have been dwindling over the years, and they have far fewer assets at their disposal than the top banks. OneUnited Bank, the largest Black-owned bank in the United States, manages a little over $650 million in assets. By comparison, JPMorgan Chase manages $3.7 trillion in assets. Because of these disparities, entrepreneurs also seek funding from venture capitalists. In the early 2010s, Hamilton intended to start her own tech company — but as she searched for investors, she saw that White men control nearly all venture capital dollars. That experience led her to establish Backstage Capital, a venture capital fund that invests in new companies led by underrepresented founders. “I said, ‘Well, instead of trying to raise money for one company, let me try to raise for a venture fund that will invest in underrepresented — and now we call them underestimated — founders who are women, people of color, and LGBTQ specifically,’ because I am all three,” Hamilton told CNN. Since then, Backstage Capital has amassed a portfolio of nearly 150 different companies and has made over 120 diversity investments, according to data from Crunchbase. But Bradley, who is also an ‘angel investor’ of minority-owned businesses, said she remains “really hopeful” that community banks, regional banks and fintechs “will all stand up and say, ‘Hey, we are not going to let the good work of SVB go to waste.’” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

In addition to water loss due to an intense multiyear drought, the US Geological Survey and the Bureau of Reclamation report found, Lake Powell faced an average annual loss in storage capacity of about 33,270 acre-feet, or 11 billion gallons, per year between 1963 and 2018. That’s enough water to fill the Reflecting Pool on the National Mall about 1,600 times. The capacity of the reservoir is shrinking because of sediments flowing in from the Colorado and San Juan rivers, according to the report. Those sediments settle at the bottom of the reservoir and decrease the total amount of water the reservoir can hold. As of Monday, Lake Powell was around 25% full, according to data from the Bureau of Reclamation. It’s bad news for a region already facing water shortages and extreme wildfires due to the drought. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration drought experts said last week these conditions are expected to at least continue – if not worsen – in the coming months. Lake Powell is an important reservoir in the Colorado River Basin. Both Lake Powell and nearby Lake Mead, the nation’s largest reservoir, have drained at an alarming rate. In August, the federal government declared a water shortage on the Colorado River for the first time after Lake Mead’s water level plunged to unprecedented lows, triggering mandatory water consumption cuts for states in the Southwest that began in January. And last week, Lake Powell dipped below the critical threshold of 3,525 feet above sea level, sparking additional concerns about water supply and hydropower generation millions of people in the West rely on for electricity. The significance of the dwindling water supply along the Colorado cannot be overstated. The system supplies water for more than 40 million people living across seven Western states and Mexico. Lakes Powell and Mead provide a critical supply of drinking water and irrigation for many across the region, including rural farms, ranches and native communities. “It is vitally important we have the best-available scientific information like this report to provide a clear understanding of water availability in Lake Powell as we plan for the future,” Tanya Trujillo, assistant secretary for water and science with the US Department of Interior, said in a statement. “The Colorado River system faces multiple challenges, including the effects of a 22-year-long drought and the increased impacts of climate change.” © 2024 Cable News Network.

The report by IQAir, a company that tracks global air quality, found that average annual air pollution in every country — and 97% of cities — exceeded the World Health Organization’s air quality guidelines, which were designed to help governments craft regulations to protect public health. Related article Not only is Lake Powell's water level plummeting because of drought, its total capacity is shrinking, too Only 222 cities of the 6,475 analyzed had average air quality that met WHO’s standard. Three territories were found to have met WHO guidelines: the French territory of New Caledonia and the United States territories of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. India, Pakistan and Bangladesh were among the countries with the worst air pollution, exceeding the guidelines by at least 10 times. The Scandinavian countries, Australia, Canada, Japan and United Kingdom ranked among the best countries for air quality, with average levels that exceeded the guidelines by 1 to 2 times. In the United States, IQAir found air pollution exceeded WHO guidelines by 2 to 3 times in 2021. “This report underscores the need for governments around the world to help reduce global air pollution,” Glory Dolphin Hammes, CEO of IQAir North America, told CNN. “(Fine particulate matter) kills far too many people every year and governments need to set more stringent air quality national standards and explore better foreign policies that promote better air quality.” Above: IQAir analyzed average annual air quality for more than 6,000 cities and categorized them from best air quality, in blue (Meets WHO PM2.5 guildline) to worst, in purple (Exceeds WHO PM2.5 guideline by over 10 times). An interactive map is available from IQAir. It’s the first major global air quality report based on WHO’s new annual air pollution guidelines, which were updated in September 2021. The new guidelines halved the acceptable concentration of fine particulate matter — or PM 2.5 — from 10 down to 5 micrograms per cubic meter. PM 2.5 is the tiniest pollutant yet also among the most dangerous. When inhaled, it travels deep into lung tissue where it can enter the bloodstream. It comes from sources like the burning of fossil fuels, dust storms and wildfires, and has been linked to a number of health threats including asthma, heart disease and other respiratory illnesses. Related article Allergy season will start much earlier than normal and be far more intense because of climate crisis, study suggests Millions of people die each year from air quality issues. In 2016, around 4.2 million premature deaths were associated with fine particulate matter, according to WHO. If the 2021 guidelines had been applied that year, WHO found there could have been nearly 3.3 million fewer pollution-related deaths. IQAir analyzed pollution-monitoring stations in 6,475 cities across 117 countries, regions and territories. In the US, air pollution spiked in 2021 compared to 2020. Out of the more than 2,400 US cities analyzed, Los Angeles air remained the most polluted, despite seeing a 6% decrease compared to 2020. Atlanta and Minneapolis saw significant increases in pollution, the report showed. “The (United States’) reliance on fossil fuels, increasing severity of wildfires as well as varying enforcement of the Clean Air Act from administration to administration have all added to U.S. air pollution,” the authors wrote. Researchers say the main sources of pollution in the US were fossil fuel-powered transportation, energy production and wildfires, which wreak havoc on the country’s most vulnerable and marginalized communities. “We are heavily dependent on fossil fuels, especially in terms of transportation,” said Hammes, who lives a few miles from Los Angeles. “We can act smartly on this with zero emissions, but we’re still not doing it. And this is having a devastating impact on the air pollution that we’re seeing in major cities.” Related article Big-box stores could help slash emissions and save millions by putting solar panels on roofs. Why aren't more of them doing it? Climate change-fueled wildfires played a significant role in reducing air quality in the US in 2021. The authors pointed to a number of fires that led to hazardous air pollution — including the Caldor and Dixie fires in California, as well as the Bootleg Fire in Oregon, which wafted smoke all the way to the East Coast in July. China — which is among the countries with the worst air pollution — showed improved air quality in 2021. More than half of the Chinese cities analyzed in the report saw lower levels of air pollution compared to the previous year. The capital city of Beijing continued a five-year trend of improved air quality, according to the report, due to a policy-driven drawdown of polluting industries in the city. The report also found that the Amazon Rainforest, which had acted as the world’s major defender against the climate crisis, emitted more carbon dioxide than it absorbed last year. Deforestation and wildfires have threatened the critical ecosystem, polluted the air and contributed to climate change. “This is all a part of the formula that will lead to or is leading to global warming.” Hammes said. The report also unveiled some inequalities: Monitoring stations remain scant in some developing countries in Africa, South America and the Middle East, resulting in a dearth of air quality data in those regions. “When you don’t have that data, you’re really in the dark,” Hammes said. Related article Could Russia's war kick-start a renewable-energy revolution? It depends where in the world you look Hammes noted the African country of Chad was included in the report for the first time, due to an improvement in its monitoring network. IQAir found the country’s air pollution was the second-highest in the world last year, behind Bangladesh. Tarik Benmarhnia, a climate change epidemiologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography who has studied the health impact of wildfire smoke, also noted that relying only on monitoring stations can lead to blind spots in these reports. “I think it is great that they relied on different networks and not only governmental sources,” Benmarhnia, who was not involved in this report, told CNN. “However, many regions do not have enough stations and alternative techniques exist.” The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded in its 2021 report that, in addition to slowing the speed of global warming, curbing the use of fossil fuels would have the added benefit of improving air quality and public health. Hammes said the IQAir report is even more reason for the world to wean off fossil fuel. “We’ve got the report, we can read it, we can internalize it and really devote ourselves to taking action,” she said. “There needs to be a major move towards renewable energy. We need to take drastic action in order to reverse the tide of global warming; otherwise, the impact and the train that we’re on (would be) irreversible.” © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

1,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-03 04:52:58.000,Big-box stores could help slash emissions and save millions by putting solar panels on roofs. Why aren't more of them doing it?,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/20/us/solar-power-on-big-box-store-rooftops-climate/index.html,2022-03-20 07:01:50.000,"As the US attempts to wean itself off its heavy reliance on fossil fuels and shift to cleaner energy sources, many experts are eyeing a promising solution: your neighborhood big-box stores and shopping malls. The rooftops and parking lot space available at retail giants like Walmart, Target and Costco is massive. And these largely empty spaces are being touted as untapped potential for solar power that could help the US reduce its dependency on foreign energy, slash planet-warming emissions and save companies millions of dollars in the process. At the IKEA store in Baltimore, installing solar panels on the roof and over the store’s parking lot cut the amount of energy it needed to purchase by 84%, slashing its costs by 57% from September to December of 2020, according to the company. (The panels also provide some beneficial shade to keep customers’ cars cool on hot, sunny days.) Related article Could Russia's war kick-start a renewable-energy revolution? It depends where in the world you look As of February 2021, IKEA had 54 solar arrays installed across 90% of its US locations. Big-box stores and shopping centers have enough roof space to produce half of their annual electricity needs from solar, according to a report from nonprofit Environment America and research firm Frontier Group. Leveraging the full rooftop solar potential of these superstores would generate enough electricity to power nearly 8 million average homes, the report concluded, and would cut the same amount of planet-warming emissions as pulling 11.3 million gas-powered cars off the road. The average Walmart store, for example, has 180,000 square feet of rooftop, according to the report. That’s roughly the size of three football fields and enough space to support solar energy that could power the equivalent of 200 homes, the report said. “Every rooftop in America that isn’t producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them,” Johanna Neumann, senior director for Environment America’s campaign for 100% Renewable, told CNN. “Now is the time to lean into local renewable energy production, and there’s no better place than the roofs of America’s big-box superstores.” Advocates involved in clean energy worker-training programs tell CNN that a solar revolution in big-box retail would also be a significant windfall for local communities, spurring economic growth while tackling the climate crisis, which has inflicted disproportionate harm on marginalized communities. Yet only a fraction of big-box stores in the US have solar on their rooftops or solar canopies in parking lots, the report’s authors told CNN. Related article Why record-high gas prices won't be solved by drilling more oil in the US CNN reached out to five of the top US retailers — Walmart, Kroger, Home Depot, Costco and Target — to ask: Why not invest in more rooftop solar? Many renewable energy experts point to solar as a relatively simple solution to cut down on costs and help rein in fossil fuel emissions, but the companies point to several roadblocks — regulations, labor costs and structural integrity of the rooftops themselves — that are preventing more widespread adoption. The need for these kinds of clean energy initiatives is becoming “unquestionably urgent” as the climate crisis accelerates, said Edwin Cowen, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Cornell University. “We are behind the eight ball, to put it mildly,” Cowen told CNN. “I would have loved to see policy help incentivize rooftop solar 15 years ago instead of five years ago in the commercial space. There’s still a tremendous amount of work to do.” Neumann said Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, possesses by far the largest solar potential. Walmart has around 5,000 stores in the US and more than 783 million square feet of rooftop space — an area larger than Manhattan — and more than 8,974 gigawatt hours of annual rooftop solar potential, according to the report. It’s enough electricity to power more than 842,000 homes, the report said. “Every rooftop in America that isn’t producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them.” Johanna Neumann, Environment America Walmart spokesperson Mariel Messier told CNN the company is involved in renewable energy projects around the world, but many of them are not rooftop solar installations. The company has reported having completed on- and off-site wind and solar projects or had others under development with a capacity to produce more than 2.3 gigawatts of renewable energy. Neumann said Environment America has met with Walmart a few times, urging the retailer to commit to installing solar panels on roofs and in parking lots. The company has said it’s aiming to source 100% of its energy through renewable projects by 2035. “Of all the retailers in America, Walmart stands to make the biggest impact if they put rooftop solar on all of their stores,” Neumann told CNN. “And for us, this report just underscores just how much of an impact they could make if they make that decision.” According to Environment America, Walmart had installed almost 194 megawatts of solar capacity on its US facilities as of the end of the 2021 fiscal year and additional capacity in off-site solar farms. The company’s installations in California were expected to provide between 20% to 30% of each location’s electricity needs. Target ranked No. 1 for on-site solar capacity in 2019, according to industry trade group Solar Energy Industries Association’s most recent report. It currently has 542 locations with rooftop solar — around a quarter of the company’s stores — a Target spokesperson told CNN. Rooftop solar generates enough energy to meet 15% to 40% of Target properties’ energy needs, the spokesperson said. Richard Galanti, the chief financial officer at Costco, said the company has 121 stores with rooftop solar around the world, 95 of which are in the US. Walmart, Target and Costco did not share with CNN what their biggest barriers are to adding rooftop or parking lot solar panels to more stores.  “My suspicion is that they want an even stronger business case for deviating from business-as-usual,” Neumann said. “Historically, all those roofs have done is cover their stores, and rethinking how [they] use their buildings and thinking of them as energy generators, not just protection from rain, requires a small change in their business model.” Home Depot, which has around 2,300 stores, currently has 75 completed rooftop solar projects, 12 in construction and more than 30 planned for future development, said Craig D’Arcy, the company’s director of energy management. Solar power generates around half of these stores’ energy needs on average, he said. Aging rooftops at stores are a “huge impediment” to solar installation, D’Arcy added. If a roof needs to be replaced in the next 15 to 20 years or sooner, it doesn’t make financial sense for Home Depot to add solar systems today, he said. “We have a goal of implementing solar rooftop where the economics are attractive,” D’Arcy told CNN. CNN also reached out to Kroger, which owns about 2,800 stores across the US. Kristal Howard, a Kroger spokesperson, said the company currently has 15 properties — stores, distribution centers and manufacturing plants — with solar installations. One of the “multiple factors affecting the viability of a solar installation” was the stores’ ability to support a solar installation on the roofs, Howard said. Cowen, the engineering professor at Cornell, said solar is already attractive, but that labor costs, incentives and the different layers of regulation likely pose some financial challenges in solar installations. “For them, this means usually hiring a local site firm that can do that installation that also knows local policy,” Cowen said. “It’s just another layer of complexity that I think is beginning to make sense because the costs have come down enough, but it needs kind of reopening that door of getting into an existing building.” Related article 'Delay means death': We're running out of ways to adapt to the climate crisis, new report shows. Here are the key takeaways Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois, who co-chairs the power sector task force in the House, said the US has “failed to provide the incentives to people who have the expertise to go in and build these things.” The reason both retail companies and the power sector have not made much progress on solar is because “our system is so disjointed” and has a complex regulation structure, Casten said. “Why aren’t we doing something that makes economic sense? The answer is this horribly disjointed federal policy where we massively subsidize fossil energy extraction, and we penalize clean energy production,” Casten told CNN. “For a long, long time, if you wanted to build a solar panel on the rooftop of Walmart, your biggest enemy was going to be your local utility because they didn’t want to lose the load. “We could have done this decades ago,” Casten added. “And had we done it, we would not be in this dire position with the climate, but we’d also have a lot more money in our pocket.” For Charles Callaway, director of organizing at the nonprofit group WE ACT for Environmental Justice, strengthening the rooftop solar capacity in big box retail stores is a no-brainer, especially if companies allow the local community to reap benefits either through installation jobs or sharing the electricity produced later. Either way, it would put a massive dent in curbing the climate crisis and help usher in an equitable transition away from fossil fuels — and it’s doable, Callaway told CNN. The New York City resident led a worker training program that helped train more than 100 local community members, mostly people of color, to become solar installers. He also formed a solar workers cooperative to ensure many of the participants of the training program get jobs in a tough market. In the last two years, Callaway said his group has not only installed solar panels on roofs of affordable housing units, but also equipment capable of producing 2 megawatts of solar energy on shopping malls up in upstate New York. He emphasized that hiring locally would be most beneficial since local installers know the community and local regulations best. Related article Allergy season will start much earlier than normal and be far more intense because of climate crisis, study suggests “One of my huge concerns is social equity,” Cowen said. “Access to renewable energy is a fairly privileged position these days, and we’ve got to figure out ways to make that not true.” Jasmine Graham, WE ACT’s energy justice policy manager, said the potential of building rooftop solar on big box superstores is encouraging, only “if these projects use local labor, if they are paying prevailing wages, and if this solar is being used in a manner such as community solar, which would allow [utility] bill discounts for folks that live in the same utility zone.” Pressure is mounting for global leaders to act urgently on the climate crisis after a UN report in late February warned the window for action is rapidly closing. Neumann believes the US can meet its energy demand with renewables. All it takes, she said, is the political will to make that switch, and the inclusion of the local community so no one gets left behind in the transition. “The sooner we make that transition, the sooner we’ll have cleaner air, the sooner we’ll have a more protected environment and better health and the sooner we’ll have a more livable future for our kids,” Neumann said. “And even if that requires investment, it is an investment worth making.” CNN’s Judson Jones contributed to this report. © 2024 Cable News Network.

1,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-03 04:52:58.000,Look of the Week: Blackpink headline Coachella in Korean hanboks,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/blackpink-coachella-2023-hanboks-lotw/index.html,2023-04-18 15:39:40.000,"Editor’s Note: Featuring the good, the bad and the ugly, ‘Look of the Week’ is a regular series dedicated to unpacking the most talked about outfit of the last seven days. Bringing the second day of this year’s Coachella to a close, K-Pop girl group Blackpink made history Saturday night when they became the first Asian act to ever headline the festival. To a crowd of, reportedly, over 125,000 people, Jennie, Jisoo, Lisa and Rosé used the ground-breaking moment to pay homage to Korean heritage by arriving onstage in hanboks: a traditional type of dress. While the garments were shrugged off a few seconds into their opening track, “Pink Venom,” revealing each member’s custom black and pink Dolce and Gabbana outfit, fans across the world had already received the message. Screenshots of the moment quickly spread among Blackpink superfans, otherwise known as Blinks. “The way they stepped onto the biggest western stage in hanboks … literally proved their place at the top of the industry,” tweeted one Blink. “Blackpink really are in a league of their own.” Another called the group “Korea’s cultural delegation” on Instagram, in reference to not only the hanboks but other visual cues incorporated into their show, such as one of the stage backdrops featuring an angular tiled roof reminiscent of traditional Korean architecture. Look of the Week: Are we about to see more men in tights? In recent years, Blackpink have enjoyed a meteoric rise to global fame. According to Guinness World Records, they are currently the most streamed female group on Spotify, and have the most-viewed music YouTube channel. Last year, they were the first female K-Pop group to reach number 1 in the UK and US album charts, and in 2020 their track “How You Like That” became the most viewed video on YouTube in 24 hours. (The group also wore modernized hanboks, designed by Kim Danha, in one of the music video’s scenes.) Their landmark set over the weekend was in fact a follow-up to another milestone: In 2019, they became the first female K-Pop group to ever play at Coachella or any other US festival. From the iconic Jean Paul Gaultier cone bra worn by Madonna for her 1990 Blond Ambition tour to Geri “Ginger Spice” Halliwell’s Union Jack mini dress, the right stage costume can live on forever in public memory. Particularly when worn at a career-defining moment. During another watershed Coachella performance — Beyonce’s 2018 headline set — the singer’s custom Balmain collegiate-style yellow hoodie was a joyful nod to Black culture, specifically historically Black colleagues and universities. The group’s four black hanboks were custom created by South Korean pattern design brand OUWR and traditional Korean dressmakers Kumdanje. Inspired by the Cheol-lik silhouette, each garment was hand-embroidered with metallic traditional Korean motifs, including dan-cheong patterns and peonies (a symbol of royalty in Korea). “It was our pleasure and such an honor to be able to show the beautiful values of Korea and Hanbok together,” the designers wrote in a combined Instagram post. “Blackpink showed the beauty of Korea and dazzled the world.” In Korea, hanboks are still worn for special occasions and often seen on TV dramas. Many designers in the country have also created contemporary takes that are incorporated into everyday wear. At Seoul Fashion Week, JULYCOLUMN’s Fall-Winter 2023 collection drew on the hanbok’s voluminous silhouette to create shirts and structured jackets. Last September, Korean label BlueTamburin brought the garment to a Western audience by exclusively using traditional hanbok fabric to create its Spring-Summer 2023 collection at Milan Fashion Week. Look of the Week: 'Barbie' stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling hit the road in bubblegum pink Whether you’re a devoted Blink or not, the looks marked a moment of Asian visibility, recognition of traditional craftsmanship and a powerful example of feeling seen through fashion — representing Korean culture and symbolically embracing both its past and future. At the end of their performance, and having addressed the audience between numbers in English throughout their two-hour-long performance, Blackpink finished their set in Korean: “Until now, it has been Jennie, Jisoo, Lisa, and Rosé Blackpink. Thank you.” Top image: Blackpink performing at the first weekend of Coachella 2023, shortly after removing their hanboks. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

1,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-03 04:52:58.000,Scientists identify secret ingredient in Leonardo da Vinci paintings,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/old-masters-da-vinci-egg-yolk-painting-scn/index.html,2023-03-30 17:43:18.000,"Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. “Old Masters” such as Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli and Rembrandt may have used proteins, especially egg yolk, in their oil paintings, according to a new study. Trace quantities of protein residue have long been detected in classic oil paintings, though they were often ascribed to contamination. A new study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications found the inclusion was likely intentional — and sheds light on the technical knowledge of the Old Masters, the most skilled European painters of the 16th, 17th, or early 18th century, and the way they prepared their paints. Scientists confirm long held theory about what inspired Monet “There are very few written sources about this and no scientific work has been done before to investigate the subject in such depth,” said study author Ophélie Ranquet of the Institute of Mechanical Process Engineering and Mechanics at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany, in a phone interview. “Our results show that even with a very small amount of egg yolk, you can achieve an amazing change of properties in the oil paint, demonstrating how it might have been beneficial for the artists.” Simply adding some egg yolk to their works, it turns out, could have long-lasting effects that went beyond just aesthetics. Compared with the medium formulated by ancient Egyptians called tempera — which combines egg yolk with powdered pigments and water — oil paint creates more intense colors, allows for very smooth color transitions and dries far less quickly, so it can be used for several days after its preparation. However, oil paint, which uses linseed or safflower oil instead of water, also has drawbacks, including being more susceptible to color darkening and damage caused by exposure to light. Because making paint was an artisanal and experimental process, it is possible that the Old Masters might have added egg yolk, a familiar ingredient, to the newer type of paint, which first showed up in the seventh century in Central Asia before spreading to Northern Europe in the Middle Ages and Italy during the Renaissance. In the study, the researchers recreated the process of paint-making by using four ingredients — egg yolk, distilled water, linseed oil and pigment — to mix two historically popular and significant colors, lead white and ultramarine blue. “The addition of egg yolk is beneficial because it can tune the properties of these paints in a drastic way,” Ranquet said, “For example by showing aging differently: It takes a longer time for the paint to oxidize, because of the antioxidants contained in the yolk.” The chemical reactions between the oil, the pigment and the proteins in the yolk directly affect the paint’s behavior and viscosity. “For example, the lead white pigment is quite sensitive to humidity, but if you coat it with a protein layer, it makes it a lot more resistant to it, making the paint quite easy to apply,” Ranquet said. “On the other hand, if you wanted something stiffer without having to add a lot of pigment, with a bit of egg yolk you can create a high impasto paint,” she added, referring to a painting technique where the paint is laid out in a stroke thick enough that the brushstrokes are still visible. Using less pigment would have been desirable centuries ago, when certain pigments — such as lapis lazuli, which was used to make ultramarine blue — were more expensive than gold, according to Ranquet. A direct evidence of the effect of egg yolk in oil paint, or lack thereof, can be seen in Leonardo da Vinci’s “Madonna of the Carnation,” one of the paintings observed during the study. Currently on display at the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, Germany, the work shows evident wrinkling on the face of Mary and the child. “Oil paint starts to dry from the surface down, which is why it wrinkles,” Ranquet said. One reason for wrinkling may be an insufficient quantity of pigments in the paint, and the study has shown that this effect could be avoided with the addition of egg yolk: “That’s quite amazing because you have the same quantity of pigment in your paint, but the presence of the egg yolk changes everything.” Because wrinkling occurs within days, it’s likely that Leonardo and other Old Masters might have caught onto this particular effect, as well as additional beneficial properties of egg yolk in oil paint, including resistance to humidity. The “Madonna of Carnation” is one of Leonardo’s earliest paintings, created at a time when he might have been still trying to master the then newly popular medium of oil paint. Another painting observed during the study was “The Lamentation Over the Dead Christ,” by Botticelli, also on display at the Alte Pinakothek. The work is mostly made with tempera, but oil paint has been used for the background and some secondary elements. “We knew that some parts of the paintings show brushstrokes that are typical for what we call an oil painting, and yet we detected the presence of proteins,” Ranquet said. “Because it’s a very small quantity and they are difficult to detect, this might be dismissed as contamination: In workshops, artists used many different things, and maybe the eggs were just from the tempera.” However, because adding egg yolk had such desirable effects on oil paint, the presence of proteins in the work might be an indication of deliberate use instead, the study suggested. Ranquet hopes that these preliminary findings might attract more curiosity toward this understudied topic. DNA analysis of Beethoven's hair reveals health issues — and a family secret Maria Perla Colombini, a professor of analytical chemistry at the University of Pisa in Italy, who was not involved in the study, agreed. “This exciting paper provides a new scenario for the understanding of old painting techniques,” she said in an email. “The research group, reporting results from molecular level up to a macroscopic scale, contributes to a new knowledge in the use of egg yolk and oil binders. They are not more looking at simply identifying the materials used by Old Masters but explain how they could produce wonderful and glittering effects by employing and mixing the few available natural materials. They try to discover the secrets of old recipes of which little or nothing is written,” she added. “This new knowledge contributes not only to a better conservation and preservation of artworks but also to a better comprehension of art history.” Top image: The “Mona Lisa” by Leonardo Da Vinci © 2024 Cable News Network.

1,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-03 04:52:58.000,How Playboy cut ties with Hugh Hefner to create a post-MeToo brand,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/playboy-the-conversation/index.html,2023-04-11 07:10:28.000,"Editor’s Note: The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation. Hugh Hefner launched Playboy Magazine 70 years ago this year. The first issue included a nude photograph of Marilyn Monroe, which he had purchased and published without her knowledge or consent. Hefner went on to build the Playboy brand off the backs of the countless women featured in its pages, whose beauty and performance of heightened feminine sexuality have entertained its readers for generations. Approaching its 70th anniversary in December, Playboy has radically shifted. With the magazine no longer in publication, the Playboy Mansion sold to a developer and London’s last remaining Playboy Club closing in 2021, what is the future for Playboy? The brand is changing to keep up with the post-#MeToo world. Hefner passed away one month before allegations against film producer Harvey Weinstein surfaced in 2017 giving momentum to the #MeToo movement (which saw survivors of sexual assault and harassment speak out against their abusers). READ MORE: Sex, love and companionship … with AI? Why human-machine relationships could go mainstream In recent years, many have re-evaluated Hefner’s legacy and relationships with women. The 2022 docuseries “The Secrets of Playboy” (which aired on Channel 4 in the UK) detailed sexual misconduct accusations against Hefner from several ex-girlfriends, including model Sondra Theodore and TV personality Holly Madison. Hefner and Playboy’s relationship with women has been complicated. Playboy was an early supporter of abortion rights, helped fund the first rape kit and was at times an early proponent of inclusivity (for example featuring transgender model, Caroline “Tula” Cossey, in its June 1981 issue). But most women featured in Playboy have fit within a narrow beauty standard — thin, white, able-bodied and blonde. Meanwhile Hefner’s personal relationship with his much younger girlfriends reportedly followed patterns of control and emotional abuse. Ex-girlfriend Holly Madison described Hefner as treating her “like a glorified pet” in her 2015 memoir, “Down the Rabbit Hole.” Hefner’s passing meant he evaded reckoning with the #MeToo movement. Playboy, however, responded, releasing a statement in which it affirmed support for the women featured in “The Secrets of Playboy” and called Hefner’s actions “abhorrent.” The statement declared that the brand was no longer affiliated with the Hefner family and would be focusing on aspects of the company’s legacy that align with values of sex positivity and free expression. READ MORE: The ‘milf’: a brief cultural history, from Mrs Robinson to Stifler’s mom Today, Playboy is a very different company from the one Hefner launched nearly 70 years ago. Roughly 80% of Playboy staff identify as women, according the company, and its motto has changed from “Entertainment for Men” to “Pleasure for All.” Shares in the company are publicly traded and 40% of its board and management are women. The company has also moved towards more creator-led content through its app, Playboy Centerfold. Similar to subscription content service OnlyFans, Playboy Centerfold allows subscribers to view content from and interact with its creators, which it call “bunnies.” On the app, creators — or bunnies — are able portray their own bodies however they wish, putting the power back in their hands. Perhaps Playboy’s future is no longer in serving the male gaze, but instead the very audience Hefner dismissed in his first letter from the editor: “If you’re a man between the ages of 18 and 80 Playboy is meant for you … If you’re somebody’s sister, wife or mother-in-law and picked us up by mistake, please pass us along to the man in your life and get back to your Ladies Home Companion.” The stars of Playboy’s mid-2000s reality series, Holly Madison and Bridget Marquardt, are also enjoying a resurgence among fans. “The Girls Next Door” launched in 2004. The show focused on the lives of Hefner’s three girlfriends, Madison, Marquardt and Kendra Wilkinson. It became E’s best performing show and cultivated a new female audience for Playboy. “The Girls Next Door” was a story of complicated empowerment despite patriarchal interference. Its three female protagonists went from being known solely as some of Hefner’s many blonde girlfriends, to celebrities in their own right. They each ultimately broke up with Hefner, leaving the Mansion and going on to lead successful careers. The show’s depiction of Madison, Marquardt and Wilkinson as empowered, fun-loving and complex individuals, who found joy and agency through expressing their sexuality was perhaps what drew so many female fans to the show. However, amid the girls’ fight for agency, Hefner retaliated. The series shows that he maintained final say in every Playboy photograph of the girls, as well as imposing strict curfews and spending allowances. In Madison and Wilkinson’s memoirs, “Down the Rabbit Hole,” and “Sliding into Home,” they claim that production consistently undermined them. They refused to pay them for the first season, didn’t credit them until season four and aired their uncensored nude bodies in foreign broadcasts and DVD releases without consent. READ MORE: #MeToo in space: We must address the potential for sexual harassment and assault away from Earth Fan interest in “The Girls Next Door” remains strong. In August 2022 Madison and Marquardt launched their podcast “Girls Next Level,” where they interview previous playmates and interact with fans. They also recap episodes from their own points of view, unpacking their experiences of working on the show. Having reached 10 million downloads as of February 2023, the success of the podcast — 14 years after the last episode of “The Girls Next Door” — speaks to the cultural legacy of the Playboy brand. It also shows that despite Hefner’s original editor’s note, Playboy resonates with some women. Playboy is now in a post-Hefner era, where the imagery of women found within old issues of Playboy can serve as inspiration for others to enjoy their own sexuality. Whatever the future has for the company, the concept of Playboy has become public property — be that in the appearance of Playboy bunny costumes each Halloween, the popularity of cheeky Playboy logo tattoos or branded lingerie and clothing. In a post-#MeToo era, the women of Playboy are speaking up and taking over. With the mansion gates closed, the bunnies are finally reclaiming the brand as their own.

Inside fashion's worrying runway trend,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/fashion-week-fall-winter-2023-size-diversity-skinny-wegovy/index.html,2023-04-06 20:53:38.000,"Now that the Fall-Winter 2023 catwalks have been disassembled, it’s clear one trend was more pervasive than any collective penchant for ruffles, pleated skirts or tailored coats. Across runways in New York, London, Milan and Paris, there was a notable scarcity of plus-size models. This comes at a time when there are five injectable medications which can be used as appetite suppressants currently available by prescription in the US, stirring much conversation; a sixth medication, Rybelsus, is taken as an oral pill. Two are officially approved in the UK — the largest influx of weight loss medication seen in the country in almost a decade. Dior's landmark Mumbai show signals India's growing luxury status In recent months, injectables such as Wegovy and Ozempic — which share the same active ingredient, semaglutide — have been widely reported as Hollywood’s worst-kept weight loss secret. (Ozempic is intended for use primarily to treat Type 2 diabetes.) Comedian Chelsea Handler claimed her “anti-aging doctor just hands (Ozempic) out to anybody” while appearing on a podcast in January. Even Elon Musk tweeted last year about being on Wegovy. For many fashion commentators and diversity advocates, the Fall-Winter 2023 runways were in sharp contrast to the (albeit limited) progress and heady promise of recent seasons. This rollback has been widely criticized in the style media as such. And its potential impact is being assessed more broadly: With the rise of these weight loss panaceas, the pursuit of size zero is now just a prescription away. In 2020, Jill Kortleve and Paloma Elsesser became the first models outside of a sample size to walk for the Italian fashion house Fendi. (Traditionally, a sample size falls between a US 0-4.) British label Erdem entered the plus-size market in 2021, extending its offering to a UK size 22 (or US size 18). And in January 2022, Valentino made headlines after its haute couture show featured a broad spectrum of body types. But this season, there was a visible lack of curve bodies on their runways — or many others. Fendi and Valentino did not respond when contacted by CNN, while Erdem declined to comment. According to fashion search engine Tagwalk, the number of mid and plus-size models dropped by 24% in comparison to Spring-Summer 2023. Similarly, a size inclusivity report conducted by Vogue Business found that 95.6% of all looks presented for Fall-Winter 2023 were in a size US 0-4. For context, industry market firm Plunkett Research estimated in 2015 that 68% of American women wear a size US 14 or above. “It was a definitive backslide,” said IMG model agent Mina White, who represents plus-size and curve supermodels including Elsesser and Ashley Graham. “It was frustrating to see some of these designers not using curved bodies where they had in the past.” Fendi and Valentino did not respond when contacted by CNN, while Erdem declined to comment. “Watching somebody like Ashley Graham attend the front row for so many of these major houses in full looks (provided by the designer), it was frustrating,” White continued. “They wanted to utilize her image and her social following to command a certain space in the market, but they didn’t want to be reflective on their runways.” For others, even the term “backslide” was too generous. “Slipping back from… what? A glorious time when the average American woman (size 16) was as present on the runways as she is in everyday life? A time when fashion ads cast as many ‘plus-size’ and ‘mid-size’ women as ‘straight-size’ women?” fashion journalist Amy Odell wrote in her Substack newsletter of this past season’s runways. “No one needed any data to understand that representing a wide array of body shapes and sizes in runway shows or in fashion imagery is not a priority for the industry.” That said, a handful of — mostly smaller — brands pushed ahead this season. In London, emerging labels Di Petsa, Karoline Vitto and Sinead O’Dwyer showcased lineups of size-diverse models. Inclusivity at Christian Siriano, Coach, Kim Shui, Collina Strada and Bach Mai stood out in New York; while in Paris, Belgian brand Esther Manas — a consistent flag-bearer for size diversity — staged one of the city’s most refreshing runways with an assortment of fun, sensual, feminine looks that complimented a range of bodies. There was also a smattering of mid- and plus-size castings to be seen elsewhere: Off-White and Michael Kors, for example, featured a few such models. At Harris Reed’s debut for Nina Ricci, Precious Lee opened the show — which also featured three more plus- and mid-size models. Fashion samples and sample size pieces are one-off garments made before an item is mass-produced, typically to be worn during runway shows. Prioritizing the same body type in sample sizes means runway models are more easily interchangeable, saving fashion houses time and money if someone were to drop out or get sick during or after the casting process for a show. It’s also partly why, according to White, casting curve models is still an uphill battle. She says she introduces brands to new faces months in advance of runway season, with their specific measurements up-top and easy to read in all correspondence. “I want to be ahead of that,” White said. “So I’m never told ‘Oh, we wanted to make it work, but we didn’t have her size’ or whatever that conversation might look like.” Look of the Week: What Pope Francis' AI puffer coat says about the future of fashion But despite her efforts, she says she’s frequently told it’s too much of a “financial lift” to make larger samples — even by legacy brands. “I get very upset when brands say that,” White said. “I don’t believe that it is, I believe that it’s people not being properly educated on how to do this right.” Beyond the lack of representation, White notes it’s painful for plus-size consumers to watch brands leverage resources to create custom, made-to-fit pieces for celebrities — all the while claiming the pot is empty for more inclusive runway samples. London-based stylist and editor Francesca Burns agrees sample sizes are part of the problem. In 2020, Burns went viral after she posted on Instagram about a fashion job gone wrong. She says she was sent five looks to style from Celine, none of which fit the size UK 8 (US 4) model booked for the shoot— an 18-year-old on her first job in the business. The experience left her “horrified,” Burns told CNN, recalling what she saw as the model’s shame and embarrassment. “Looking into this girl’s eyes,” Burns said, “she shouldn’t have felt like that.” Burns’ post, which called the current system “unacceptable,” was picked up widely in the fashion media. (When reached by CNN, Celine declined to comment on the incident.) “Ultimately, the desire to see change has to be there,” Burns said. “And I wonder whether luxury has that desire?” Progress has been slow, but not entirely inexistent. Across fashion campaigns, magazine covers and editorial shoots, there is a growing enthusiasm for inclusivity. “I see the options rolling in for the plus-sized talent, and they’re great offerings,” said White. “Great, strong editorials and covers and campaigns. But I do feel like without the clothes, we are going to go back to see more naked curve stories, or lingerie curve stories or a curve girl in a trench coat. That’s what I don’t want.” For British Vogue’s April issue, unveiled March 16, Elsesser, Lee and Jill Kortleve were dubbed “The New Supers.” Preceding the cover story is a letter written by editor-in-chief, Edward Enninful commending the models for “leading the way” and holding “powerful space” in the industry. “Catwalks are once again under scrutiny for a stark lack of body diversity,” read the magazine’s Instagram caption, unveiling the cover. “But this cover was not conceived as a statement. It is a crowning of an all-powerful trio, the supermodels for a new generation.” But many online were quick to point out the disconnect: Two of the Saint Laurent Spring-Summer 2023 dresses were modeled by plus-size women, though they are not available to buy in most plus sizes. In his own social media post, Enninful wrote about his disappointment at the Fall-Winter 2023 runways. “I thought I had gotten into a time machine. Show after show dominated by one body type, so many limited visions of womanhood… one prescribed notion of beauty prevailed again, and it felt like the reality of so many women around the world were being ignored.” But for White, the power rests within the entire industry — not just at the feet of brands. “I really do believe there should be an industry standard between the (Council of Fashion Designers of America), the British Fashion Council and key editors at some of these major mass market magazines,” she continued. “If there was a call-to-action from these figureheads saying, moving forward samples need to be readily available for a few different body types, we would see significant and impactful change.” Burns agrees there must be a trickle-down effect. “I think a lot of responsibility is put on young designers to solve all these issues around sustainability or issues around body inclusivity,” she said. “It’s important that the big powerhouses, which have the capacity to action change, really take some responsibility.” On March 8, Wegovy — developed primarily as a treatment for those living with obesity and weight-related conditions — was approved in the UK. It’s the second injectable weight management medication to be made available with a prescription via the country’s National Health Service (NHS) in about 3 years, after almost a decade of quiet. Before 2020, the last weight loss medication was approved in the UK was in 2010. Similarly, the US has now approved three weight management injections: Wegovy, Saxenda and IMCIVREE. Medications for type-2 diabetes like Mounjaro and Ozempic are not FDA-approved for weight loss, though some doctors are issuing them at their own discretion. While these medicines are a revolutionary tool for those who struggle to lose weight for genetic or medical reasons, they are at risk of being abused. Semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic, was originally developed for treating type-2 diabetes. It quells hunger signals to the brain by mimicking the hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). “It can slow how quickly your stomach empties out and may give you a little more feeling of feeling full,” said Dr. Robert Lash, an endocrinologist and Chief Medical Officer of the Endocrine Society in Washington, D.C. In clinical trials, over a period of 68 weeks, participants who used the medication in conjunction with eating fewer calories and increasing their physical activity on average lost around 15% of their body weight compared to 2.4% of those using a placebo, according to the manufacturer Novo Nordisk. On March 13, the European Medicines Agency issued a statement warning of an Ozempic shortage that could continue through the year, urging doctors to prioritize prescriptions to diabetics. “Any other use, including for weight management, represents off-label use and currently places the availability of Ozempic for the indicated population at risk,” read the release. Patients typically need a BMI of 27 or higher (along with another weight-related condition like high blood pressure or diabetes) or have a genetic predisposition towards obesity to be prescribed such appetite suppressant medication by their doctor. But talk of these injectables has been sweeping the West. In January, the New York Times reported on the term “Ozempic Face,” coined by a New York-based dermatologist who reported treating several patients with a hollowed-out appearance that can come with rapid weight loss. By the end of February, the medication had made it to the cover of New York Magazine in a feature titled “Life After Food?” Adverts for GLP-1 injections are even blanketing New York City subway stations. And across social media, online forums and private group chats, some people looking to lose weight for primarily aesthetic purposes are searching for a way to skirt the requirements. “I was just looking for a way to lose a few pounds, like 10 to 15 at most,” said one 30-year-old American woman, who wished to remain anonymous, in a phone interview. She scoured social media and forums for guidance on securing a weight loss drug. “I’m certainly a normal BMI, I just have a trip to Mexico coming up and I want to look really good,” she said. Although she says she found a way to access Wegovy, she decided against the medication after considering the cost (which can reach more than $1,000 a month without insurance). “I’ve always very much fit the societal standard but lately I was just like f*ck it, I want to be skinny,” she told CNN. Dr. Lash emphasized the importance of taking weight loss drugs only with medical supervision and a valid prescription. “If somebody was a normal weight and they took this drug because they thought they could be even thinner than they are now, that could lead to complications,” he told CNN, warning of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and even gallbladder problems. “These drugs are not benign, they do have side effects involving the GI tract. There’s no such thing as a free lunch.” Fashion has long promoted size 0 as the ultimate virtue — regardless of its viability for many people, or any health risks. And now with the accessibility of accelerated weight loss medication, the stakes are even higher. For Burns and White, the industry is responsible for amplifying a new, more inclusive vision of beauty. “There’s a very archaic way of looking at women over a size 16 and just assuming that they’re unhealthy or uneducated or unstylish. Or don’t have the resources to buy into luxury,” said White. “The reality is the same women these brands are alienating in their fashion space are the same women running out to buy their handbags, shoes, perfumes, cosmetics and skincare.” Not only do designers need to create clothes with this consumer in mind, according to White, but they need to be seen on the runway, too. “It shouldn’t be a conversation. It should just be normalized that we’re not just looking at a single view of beauty,” echoed Burns. Ester Manas and Balthazar Delepierre, whose bridal-inspired Fall-Winter 2023 collection was one of this season’s most size-diverse runways, summarized it best in their accompanying show notes: “The body is not the subject. Because, obviously, at a wedding, everybody is invited. And all to the party. That is where the designer duo Ester and Balthazar take their stand.” © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

1,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-03 04:52:58.000,Michael Jordan's 1998 NBA Finals sneakers sell for a record $2.2 million,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/michael-jordan-sneakers-1998-finals-sothebys-auction-record/index.html,2023-04-12 03:17:57.000,"Editor’s Note: This story was updated with the final sale price and other details following the auction. In 1998, Michael Jordan laced up a pair of his iconic black and red Air Jordan 13s to bring home a Bulls victory during Game 2 of his final NBA championship — and now they are the most expensive sneakers ever to sell at auction.The game-winning sneakers sold for $2.2 million at Sotheby’s in New York on Tuesday, smashing the sneaker auction record of $1.47 million, set in 2021 by a pair of Nike Air Ships that Jordan wore earlier in his career. Remember when Dennis Rodman put on a wedding dress and claimed to marry himself? The sale arrives during “Jordan Year” — a reference to the NBA star player’s iconic jersey number 23. In January, Air Jordan partnered with Sotheby’s to auction off 13 pairs of retro sneakers that were designed in memory of The Notorious B.I.G. All lots outsold their high estimates of $5,000 by multiples, with the highest selling for more than $32,000. Last year, Jordan’s Game 1 jersey, also from the 1998 finals, became the most expensive item of worn sports memorabilia to sell at auction when it fetched $10.1 million at a Sotheby’s sale. Jordan’s farewell run with the Chicago Bulls is often referred to as “The Last Dance,” after the title of an ESPN and Netflix documentary that chronicled the season. Jordan announced his (second) retirement weeks before the finals, leading to the six-game series against the Utah Jazz becoming the most-watched in NBA history, based on Nielsen TV ratings. (Jordan would later return from 2001 to 2003 to play with the Washington Wizards, but did not win another championship). “Michael Jordan game-worn sports memorabilia has proven time and time again to be the most elite and coveted items on the market,” said Brahm Wachter, Sotheby’s head of streetwear and modern collectables, in a press release prior to the sale. “However, items from his ‘Last Dance’ season are of a greater scale and magnitude as seen with our record-breaking sale of his Game 1 jersey in 2022.” The pair of sneakers sold Tuesday were worn during Game 2, in Salt Lake City, which the Bulls won 93-88 after losing Game 1, with Jordan scoring 37 points. They are the last pair of black and red Air Jordan 13s that Jordan ever wore on the court for an NBA game, a press release from Sotheby’s noted. 13 of the best menswear looks from Oscars history Following Game 2, Jordan signed and gifted the set of worn shoes to the ball boy in the visitor’s locker room, as he was known to do, according to Sotheby’s. The Air Jordan 13 sneakers starred in a sports memorabilia sale called “Victoriam,” which featured items worn by athletes including Tom Brady, Kobe Bryant and Roger Federer. Several other Jordan items were included in the two-part auction, with a game-worn 1998 Bulls jersey and a pair of 1985 Air Jordan 1s fetching $508,000 and $127,000 respectively. Other top lots included one of Kobe Bryant’s LA Lakers shooting shirts, which sold for over $406,000, and a soccer jersey, worn by the late Pelé on his debut for the New York Cosmos in 1975, that sold fetched over $177,000.

1,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-03 04:52:58.000,The surreal facades of America's strip clubs,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/francois-prost-gentlemens-club/index.html,2023-03-06 14:13:40.000,"Some people travel the world in search of adventure, while others seek out natural wonders, cultural landmarks or culinary experiences. But French photographer François Prost was looking for something altogether different during his recent road trip across America: strip clubs. From Miami to Los Angeles, Prost’s latest book “Gentlemen’s Club” charts his route across the US via nearly 150 strip clubs with names like Pleasures, Temptations and Cookies N’ Cream. There isn’t a single nude woman to be seen, however, as Prost’s camera was exclusively trained on the buildings themselves — and specifically their often-colorful facades. Over the course of five weeks in 2019 he traversed over 6,000 miles, with the resulting photos capturing everything from the pastel hues of Florida’s Club Pink Pussycat to venues hiding in plain sight in the country’s more religious states. “I’d divide these venues into two types: One is very integrated into the public landscape, and one is a bit more hidden and dodgy,” Prost said, speaking to CNN on a video call and email. The first type, he added, could be found in “very American” settings, such as “around amusement parks and fast food and malls.” The latter venues, however, would sometimes look indistinguishable from any store in a strip mall. Prost said he found many such establishments along the Bible Belt, a socially conservative region in the country’s south. He was especially keen to explore the area due to the apparent contrast between the prevalence of strip clubs and what he describes in his book as “conservatism and extreme puritanism.” Prost insisted that he had little interest in the interiors or services of the strip clubs, which he always visited during the day. Instead, he hoped to learn more about American culture by creating objective, documentary-style photographs of establishments sitting at the intersection of sex, gender and commerce. Documenting changing attitudes toward sex through the lens of architecture, he added that the series was primarily of a landscape photography project. Artful photos inside Houston's ONYX strip club tell a story of beauty and confidence “The prism of this theme of strip club facades became a way of studying and trying to understand the country,” he wrote in “Gentlemen’s Club,” photographs from which will feature in an exhibition in Tokyo in March. ”(‘Gentlemen’s Club’ is) an objective panorama of dominant opinions and gender and the sexualization of the feminine image.” The genesis of Prost’s project dates back to his 2018 series, “After Party,” which focused on the flamboyant facades of French nightclubs. He said that people frequently commented that the buildings’ exteriors looked as though they had been ripped straight out of American cities, sparking the idea that he should visit the US and extend the project. As he meticulously planned his trip, he was struck not only by the sheer volume of strip clubs in America but that — unlike In Europe — they often demanded to be seen. Hot pink walls, gigantic nude silhouettes and even candy-cane-striped storefronts made no secret of the kind of entertainment provided inside. From Brutalist Boston to Modernist Palm Springs, America's most eye-catching city halls “A good example would be Las Vegas, where strip clubs are everywhere and their signs blink as much as a fast food (restaurant) or casino sign,” Prost said. Miami’s clubs were often painted in vivid, Wes Anderson-esque hues. Other photos show brightly covered venues contrasting with their sparse desert surroundings. If the establishments were open during the day, Prost would enter and ask for permission to take photos in order “to not look suspicious… and explain what my intentions were,” he said. The interiors rarely lived up to the tantalizing promises plastered across the signs outside, but the photographer met a host of characters during his five-week trip, from indifferent bouncers to managers who were thrilled about the project. “Most of the time, people were OK — 99% of them would say yes to a facade picture,” he said, adding they typically wouldn’t mind his presence, as long as he didn’t take photos of patrons or dancers. “Some would think that it was a bit strange, some would be really excited about it and give me their business card to send me the picture when it was done,” he said. Prost said his biggest surprise, however, was how “normalized” strip clubs appeared to be in everyday life. As he reflects in his book, “The relationship that Americans seem to have with strip clubs is quite different to what you see in Europe. Going to a strip club seems to be a lot more normalized … You go as a couple, or amongst friends at night to have fun.” Giant doughnuts and a shoe you can walk into: California's strangest buildings He was struck, for instance, by the fact that so many Las Vegas strip clubs doubled as restaurants — with many boasting happy hour deals, buffets and special discounts for truck drivers or construction workers. “I noticed a few strip clubs that would advertise being a strip club and steakhouse, so you could eat a big piece of meat (while) watching strippers. That is also something that seems very American to me,” he said, adding: “I heard from some people I met in Portland there are even strip clubs (that offer) vegan food.” The facades are littered with jokes like “My sex life is like the Sahara, 2 palms, no dates” and pun-based names like Booby Trap and Bottoms Up. Prost’s documentarian approach heightens the signs’ surreal comedy. But it also doubles as a neutral lens through which viewers can make up their own minds about the objectification of women. By honing in on the faceless dancing bodies of female silhouettes and the quintessential “girls girls girls” signs, “Gentleman’s Club” explores the commodification of women who are, in reality, completely absent in Prost’s works (an observation reflected in the book’s title, which is a phrase that crops up numerous times on signs throughout his photographs). The strip clubs he visited market women as things to be consumed, from the many food-themed names to an advertisement reading, “1,000’s of beautiful girls & three ugly ones.” For his next project, Prost plans to visit Japan to document the nation’s love hotels, which occupy a similar role as strip clubs in some parts of the US: open secrets in a conservative society. But the photographer believes the American establishments he visited say something unique about the country — something that is less about sexuality and more about the American dream. Museum of Sex to open new outpost in Miami What his project has shown him is, he said, this: “As long as you’re successful in terms of business, (it doesn’t matter) if your activity deals with sex.” “Gentlemen’s Club” will be exhibited at Agnes b. Galerie Boutique in Tokyo, Japan, between March 17 and April 15, 2023. The book, published by Fisheye Editions, is available now. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

1,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-03 04:52:58.000,Here's the real reason to turn on airplane mode when you fly,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/airplane-mode-reasons-why/index.html,2023-04-07 12:52:23.000,"Editor’s Note: The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation. We all know the routine by heart: “Please ensure your seats are in the upright position, tray tables stowed, window shades are up, laptops are stored in the overhead bins and electronic devices are set to flight mode.” Now, the first four are reasonable, right? Window shades need to be up so we can see if there’s an emergency, such as fire. Tray tables need to be stowed and seats upright so we can get out of the row quickly. Laptops can become projectiles in an emergency, as the seat back pockets are not strong enough to contain them. And mobile phones need to be set to flight mode so they can’t cause an emergency for the airplane, right? Well, it depends whom you ask. Aviation navigation and communication relies on radio services, which has been coordinated to minimize interference since the 1920s. The digital technology currently in use is much more advanced than some of the older analog technologies we used even 60 years ago. Research has shown personal electronic devices can emit a signal within the same frequency band as the aircraft’s communications and navigation systems, creating what is known as electromagnetic interference. Half of the world's 10 busiest airports for 2022 are in one country But in 1992, the US Federal Aviation Authority and Boeing, in an independent study, investigated the use of electronic devices on aircraft interference and found no issues with computers or other personal electronic devices during non-critical phases of flight. (Takeoffs and landings are considered the critical phases.) The US Federal Communications Commission also began to create reserved frequency bandwidths for different uses – such as mobile phones and aircraft navigation and communications – so they do not interfere with one another. Governments around the globe developed the same strategies and policies to prevent interference problems with aviation. In the EU, electronic devices have been allowed to stay on since 2014. What's the safest seat on a plane? We asked an aviation expert Why then, with these global standards in place, has the aviation industry continued to ban the use of mobile phones? One of the problems lies with something you may not expect – ground interference. Wireless networks are connected by a series of towers; the networks could become overloaded if passengers flying over these ground networks are all using their phones. The number of passengers that flew in 2021 was over 2.2 billion, and that’s half of what the 2019 passenger numbers were. The wireless companies might have a point here. Of course, when it comes to mobile networks, the biggest change in recent years is the move to a new standard. Current 5G wireless networks – desirable for their higher speed data transfer – have caused concern for many within the aviation industry. Radio frequency bandwidth is limited, yet we are still trying to add more new devices to it. The aviation industry points out that the 5G wireless network bandwidth spectrum is remarkably close to the reserved aviation bandwidth spectrum, which may cause interference with navigation systems near airports that assist with landing the aircraft. Airport operators in Australia and the US have voiced aviation safety concerns linked to 5G rollout, however it appears to have rolled out without such problems in the European Union. Either way, it is prudent to limit mobile phone use on planes while issues around 5G are sorted out. Most airlines now provide customers with Wi-Fi services that are either pay-as-you-go or free. With new Wi-Fi technologies, passengers could theoretically use their mobile phones to make video calls with friends or clients in-flight. On a recent flight, I spoke with a cabin attendant and asked her opinion on phone use during flights. It would be an inconvenience for cabin crew to wait for passengers to finish their call to ask them if they would like any drinks or something to eat, she stated. On an airliner with 200+ passengers, in-flight service would take longer to complete if everyone was making phone calls. For me, the problem with in-flight use of phones is more about the social experience of having 200+ people on a plane, and all potentially talking at once. In a time when disruptive passenger behaviour, including “air rage”, is increasingly frequent, phone use in flight might be another trigger that changes the whole flight experience. Disruptive behaviours take on various forms, from noncompliance to safety requirements such as not wearing seat belts, verbal altercations with fellow passengers and cabin crew, to physical altercations with passengers and cabin crews – typically identified as air rage. In conclusion – in-flight use of phones does not currently impair the aircraft’s ability to operate. But cabin crews may prefer not to be delayed in providing in-flight service to all of the passengers – it’s a lot of people to serve. However, 5G technology is encroaching on the radio bandwidth of aircraft navigation systems; we’ll need more research to answer the 5G question regarding interference with aircraft navigation during landings. Remember that when we are discussing the two most critical phases of flight, takeoffs are optional – but landings are mandatory.

He survived, and here's his advice",https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/hippo-attack-avoid-survive-paul-templer/index.html,2023-04-12 12:44:43.000,"Paul Templer was living his best life. He was 28 and conducting tours in his native Zimbabwe, with a focus on photographic safaris. He had been away for a few years, including a stint in the British army. But he had returned to Africa’s bush country “and fell back in love with it. The wildlife, the flora, the fauna, the great outdoors, the space – just everything about it. I was at home.” Templer said Zimbabwe’s guide certification program was rigorous, and there was a lot of pride among the guides who passed. He reveled in showing tourists the area’s majestic wildlife – including the water-loving, very territorial hippos. “It was idyllic,” he told CNN Travel. “Life was really, really good – until one day I had a really bad day at the office.” March 9, 1996. A Saturday. Templer learned a good friend who was to lead a canoe safari down the Zambezi River had malaria. He agreed to take his pal’s place. “I loved that stretch of the river. It was an area I know like the back of my hand.” The expedition consisted of six safari clients (four Air France crewmembers and a couple from Germany), three apprentice guides plus Templer. They had three canoes – clients in the first two seats and a guide in the back. Then one apprentice guide was in a one-person safety kayak. And down the famed Zambezi they went. “Things were going the way they were supposed to go. Everyone was having a pretty good time.” Eventually, they came across a pod of about a dozen hippos. That’s not unexpected on the Zambezi, Africa’s fourth-longest river. They weren’t alarmed at first as they were at a safe distance. But “we were getting closer, and I was trying to take evasive action. … The idea was let’s just paddle safely around the hippos.” Templer’s canoe led the way, with the other two canoes and kayak to follow. He pulled into a little channel waiting on the others. But the third canoe had fallen back from the group and was off the planned course. Templer’s not sure how that happened. Suddenly, there’s this big thud. And I see the canoe, like the back of it, catapulted up into the air. Paul Templer “Suddenly, there’s this big thud. And I see the canoe, like the back of it, catapulted up into the air. And Evans, the guide in the back of the canoe, catapulted out of the canoe.” The clients managed to remain in the canoe somehow. “Evans is in the water, and the current is washing Evans toward a mama hippo and her calf 150 meters [490 feet] away. … So I know I’ve got to get him out quickly. I don’t have time to drop my clients off.” He yells to Ben, one of the other guides, to retrieve the clients who were in the canoe that had been attacked. Ben got the clients to safety on a rock in the middle of the river that hippos couldn’t climb. Meanwhile, Templer turned his canoe around to get Evans. The plan was to pull alongside of him and pull him into Templer’s canoe. “I was paddling towards him … getting closer, and I saw this bow wave coming towards me. If you’ve ever seen any of those old movies with a torpedo coming toward a ship, it was kind of like that. I knew it was either a hippo or a really large crocodile coming at me,” he said. “But I also knew that if I slapped the blade of my paddle on water … that’s really loud. And the percussion underwater seems to turn the animals away,” he said. “So I slapped the water, and as it was supposed to do, the torpedo wave stops.” He was getting closer to Evans, but they were also getting closer to the female and calf. “I’m leaning over – it’s kind of a made-for-Hollywood movie – Evans is reaching up. … Our fingers almost touched. And then the water between us just erupted. Happened so fast I didn’t see a thing.” What happened next was nightmarish and surreal. “My world went dark and strangely quiet.” Templer said it took a few seconds to figure out what was going on. “From the waist down, I could feel the water. I could feel I was wet in the river. From my waist up, it was different. I was warm, and it wasn’t wet like the river, but it wasn’t dry either. And it was just incredible pressure on my lower back. I tried to move around; I couldn’t. “I realized I was up to my waist down a hippo’s throat.” There’s a good reason a fully grown hippopotamus can fit a large portion of a fully grown adult in its mouth. Hippos can grow up to 16.5 feet long (5 meters), 5.2 feet tall (1.6 meters) and weigh up to 4.5 tons (4 metric tonnes), according to National Geographic. They sport enormous mouths and can open their strong jaws to 150 degrees. Their teeth might be the most frightening thing of all. Their molars are used for eating plants, but their sharp canines, which might reach 20 inches (51 centimeters), are for defense and fighting. Their bite is almost three times stronger than that of a lion. One bite from a hippo can possibly cut a human body in half. They’re found naturally in various parts sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in East and Southern Africa, living in or near rivers and other water sources. (And they are an invasive species in Colombia thanks to escapees from drug lord Pablo Escobar’s menagerie). Hippos are very territorial and might aggressively attack any animal encroaching on their territory, including hyenas, lions and crocodiles. They also kill people. That we know for sure. Many internet sources say around 500 a year, but an exact figure is still uncertain because some attacks and deaths come in very remote regions and don’t get reported. “The question I get asked the most when people find out I study hippos is: ‘Is it true hippos kill more people than any animal?’ Rebecca Lewison, conservation ecologist and associate professor at San Diego State University, told CNN Travel in an email interview. How to survive a cobra bite -- or better yet, avoid one entirely “I’m not entirely sure where that started but … there is no authority or reliable data. People are surprised that hippos kill people. They look slow, and they are mostly in water. There are some nonfatal interactions, but people (or hippos) tend to fare badly from interactions.” Dr. Philip Muruthi, chief scientist and vice president of species conservation and science of the African Wildlife Foundation, said the AWF doesn’t have a credible source on the number of attacks or fatalities either. While more stats need to be collected, one study found that the probability of being killed by a hippopotamus attack is in the range of 29% to 87% – higher than that of a grizzly bear attack at 4.8%, shark attack at 22.7% and crocodile attack at 25%. Those were rather bad odds of survival working against Templer. “I’m guessing I was wedged so far down its throat it must have been uncomfortable because he spat me out. So I burst to the surface, sucked a lungful of fresh air and I came face to face with Evans, the guide who I was trying to rescue. And I said, ‘We got to get out of here!’ ” So once again, I’m up to my waist down the hippo’s throat. But this time, my legs are trapped but my hands are free. Paul Templer But Evans was in serious trouble. Templer started swimming back for him “and I was just moving in for your classic lifesaver’s hold when – WHAM! – I got hit from below. So once again, I’m up to my waist down the hippo’s throat. But this time my legs are trapped but my hands are free.” He tried to go for his gun, but he was being thrashed around so much he couldn’t grab it. The hippo – which turned out to be an older, aggressive male – spat Templer out a second time. “This time when I come to the surface I look around, there’s no sign of Evans.” Templer assumed Evans had been rescued, and he tried to escape himself. “I’m making pretty good progress and I’m swimming along there and I come up for the stroke and swimming freestyle and I look under my arm – and until my dying day I’ll remember this – there’s this hippo charging in towards me with his mouth wide open bearing in before he scores a direct hit.” This time, Templer was sideways in the hippo’s mouth, legs dangling out one side of the mouth, shoulders and head on the other side of its mouth. “And then he just goes berserk. … When hippos are fighting, the way they fight is they try to tear apart and just destroy whatever it is they’re attacking,” Templer said. “For me, fortunately everything was happening in slow motion. So when he’d go under water, I’d hold my breath. When we were on the surface, I would take a deep breath and I would try to hold onto tusks that were boring through me” to stop from being ripped apart. Templer said one of the clients watching the horror later described it like a “vicious dog trying to rip apart a rag doll.” He figures the whole attack took about three and a half minutes. Meanwhile, apprentice guide Mack in the safety kayak – “showing incredible bravery, risking his life to save mine – pulls his boat in inches from my face.” Templer managed to grab a handle on the kayak, and “Mack dragged me to the relative safety of this rock.” The expedition was still in one hell of a mess, though. People living near hippo territory are more likely victims of attacks than tourists, said Lewison. “Most of the attacks happen in the water, but because hippos raid crops on farms, there are also attacks on people trying to protect their crops. There are some tourists, but largely the attacks are happening to local residents,” Lewison said. Human encroachment from Africa’s booming population makes matters worse, increasing the chances of deadly interactions, she said. You encounter a bear in the wild. Do you know what to do next? Despite the encounters gone bad, sub-Saharan Africa depends on hippos. “Hippos are important ecosystem engineers of the ecology of freshwater areas they inhabit. This is through nutrient recycling from dung (they consume large amounts of vegetation),” Muruthi said. “Hippos attack not to eat people, but to get them the hell away from them,” Lewison said. “I don’t think hippos are particularly aggressive, but I think when under pressure, they attack.” Back on the rock in the Zambezi, Templer asked Mack where Evans was. Mack said, “He’s gone, man, he’s just gone.” Templer knew he needed to come up with a plan to get them off the rock and to the riverbank, but “first I needed to settle myself down.” He assessed the situation: One man missing. The first aid kit, radio and gun all gone. Six scared clients, two canoes and one paddle left. And his own body was shattered. “My left foot was especially bad; it looked as if someone had tried to beat a hole through it with a hammer.” He couldn’t move his arms. One arm from elbow down was “crushed to a pulp.” Blood was bubbling out of his mouth. They realized his lung was punctured. Mack rolled Templer over and could see a gaping hole in his back and plugged it with Saran Wrap from a plate of snacks. Templer made the call: No matter the risk, they had to get off that rock. He was loaded into a canoe. Ben paddled. The hippo kept bumping the canoe. He went from being terrified to calm on that ride back. He described “a profound spiritual experience in which I had this incredible sense of peace and realization this was my moment of choice. Like do I go, or do I stay? Do I close my eyes and drift off, or do I fight my way through this and stick around?” It was so intense I thought I was going to die, and when I didn’t, I kind of wished I would. Paul Templer on the pain after the attack “I chose to stick around, and as soon as I made that choice, it was more pain than I could ever imagine I could endure. It was so intense I thought I was going to die, and when I didn’t, I kind of wished I would.” Ben and Templer made it out of the river, but without finding Evans. His body was found three days later. They concluded he had drowned because he didn’t have any signs of animal attack on him. “Evans did nothing wrong. The fact that he died was purely a tragedy.” Meanwhile, some people on shore had realized something was wrong in the river. A well-trained Zimbabwe rescue team was able to safely ferry everyone else off the rock. “And that was my bad day at the office.” Templer was out of the river but not out of the woods. It took eight hours to drive him to the nearest hospital. In a month’s time, he had several major surgeries. He thought he would lose one leg and both arms. His surgeon didn’t think he’d live. But not only did the surgeon save Templer’s life, he saved his legs and one arm. The other arm, however, was beyond salvation. If you're attacked by an alligator, here's how to fight for your life He realized that in the ICU when he woke up and was feeling for his left hand. It was gone. “I just remember feeling devastated. I spent my whole life being active and it was almost more than I could bare.” But then he was flooded with relief to realize his right arm and legs had been saved. For the next month, he was “emotionally all over the map.” He got physical and occupational therapy in Zimbabwe and then more in the United Kingdom. He got a prosthesis “and then just started trying to get back to life.” Templer, Muruthi and Lewison all say safe outings start with education – and avoiding trouble in the first place. “Hippos have no interest in dealing with people. Stay away from them, and they will leave you alone. They are not hunting humans,” Lewison said. “Do not get close to them,” Muruthi said. “They don’t want any intrusion. … They’re not predators; it’s by accident if they’re injuring people.” Want close-up views and photos of the creatures? Instead of venturing too close, invest in good binoculars and telephoto camera lenses. Follow the rules. If you are a tourist, and it says ‘Stay in your vehicle,’ then stay in your vehicle. Philip Muruthi on avoiding hippo attacks Do not walk along well-worn hippo paths, stay close to your group and don’t approach them from behind, Muruthi said. “Follow the rules. If you are a tourist, and it says ‘Stay in your vehicle,’ then stay in your vehicle. And even when you’re in your vehicle, don’t drive it right to the animal.” Muruthi also advised that your party make some noise in areas known for hippos. “It’s good for them to know you’re around.” “Hippos usually come out of water late in the evening and at night to forage, so avoid trekking along the river at that time,” Muruthi said. Also stay on high alert during the dry season when food is scarce. Get to know the signs of disturbed hippos, Muruthi advised, in case you wander too closely. An agitated one will open its mouth wide and yawn as aggressive display. Also watch for a head thrown back, shaking of the head, grunting and snorting. “These are signs you should have left already!” Muruthi said. If you’ve attracted unwanted attention, Muruthi said to always remember you cannot outrun a hippo. They may look sluggish, but they can run 30 mph (almost 43 kph). Instead, you should try to climb a tree or find an obstacle to put between you and the hippo such as a rock or anthill. Muruthi, Lewison and Templer all said never stay between a hippo and the water. If it’s charging you, run parallel to the water source. As with so many other protective female animals, never get between a mama hippo and her young, Templer said. He was alone, deep in the moutains. And a rattlesnake just bit him. What if you’re in a small watercraft? “Typically, if a hippo is going to be attacking, you’ll see it coming way before. There will be that bow wave. … If you slap the water, the percussion 99.9 times out of 100 will turn the hippo,” Templer said. “If you’re in a canoe and a hippo knocks you in the water, get away from the canoe. The hippo is going for this big shape, getting it off its territory.” It’s also safer to view hippos on the water in a larger vessel, which the animal would have a harder time capsizing, Muruthi said. Unlike attacks by some other wild animals, humans are almost defenseless once an attack by a large hippo begins. “Once attacked, there is nothing you can do,” Muruthi said. “Fight for dear life and watch for any chance to escape.” He said you could try to poke at the eyes or any spot that might inflict unexpected pain. But given the size just of a hippo head, even that’s a tall order. Hippos typically hole punch you, so there isn’t much you can do if they get hold of you. Rebecca Lewison “Hippos typically hole punch you, so there isn’t much you can do if they get hold of you,” Lewison said. Based on his attack, Templer said try not to panic “when dragged underwater. Remember to suck in air if on the surface.” Another hippo attack survivor in this National Geographic video also was able to conserve her breath. She also grabbed the hippo’s snout, and one expert in the video theorizes that might have startled the hippo into letting her go. Two years after that attack, Templer said that he and a team made the longest recorded descent of the Zambezi River to date. It took three months and covered 1,600 miles (2,575 kilometers). How did Templer find the resilience to reclaim his life? After a particularly rough day trying to maneuver in a wheelchair, he said that his surgeon told him: “You’re the sum of your choices. You’re exactly who, what and where you choose to be in life.” Templer said he focused on what’s possible vs. what he’s lost. “If you look for what’s possible, it generally is.” Templer later moved to United States; got married to the sister of a journalist on the record-setting Zambezi trip; wrote the book “What’s Left of Me”; and is a speaker. Should people be afraid to even go on safari – especially in hippo areas – after learning of a harrowing story like Templer’s? Muruthi said go, but go smartly. Be sure to get advice from professional tour guides – and then follow their guidance, Muruthi said. “In Kenya, for example, contact the Kenya Professional Safari Guides Association,” he said. Templer said his attack was an “anomaly,” and he doesn’t want anyone to be dissuaded by what happened on his 1996 river run. “My biggest counsel would be: Absolutely go and do it. But hook yourself up with someone who knows what they’re doing out there. But by all means, go out … and experience it.” © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Get the latest news in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments. He’d spent years backpacking around the world, and Japanese traveler Daisuke Kajiyama was finally ready to return home to pursue his long-held dream of opening up a guesthouse. In 2011, Kajiyama arrived back in Japan with his Israeli partner Hila, who he met in Nepal, and the pair set about finding the perfect location for their future venture. However, there were a couple of major stumbling blocks in their way. To start with, Kajiyama had very little money to speak of after years of globetrotting around destinations like Korea, Taiwan, India, Nepal, Guatemala, Cuba and Canada. He also happened to have his heart set on a traditional Japanese house, typically known as kominka, which are usually passed down over generations. “I wanted to have a traditional house in the countryside,” Kajiyama tells CNN Travel, explaining that he was determined to find two houses located next to each other, so that he and Hila could live in one, while the other would be a guesthouse that they’d run together. “I had a vision.” This US couple bought and renovated a 14th-century Italian home When he was unable to find anything that met his requirements, Kajiyama decided to shift his search to include the growing number of abandoned homes in the country. As younger people ditch rural areas in pursuit of jobs in the city, Japan’s countryside is becoming filled with “ghost” houses, or “akiya.” According to the Japan Policy Forum, there were 61 million houses and 52 million households in Japan in 2013, and with the country’s population expected to decline from 127 million to about 88 million by 2065, this number is likely to increase. Kajiyama was driving around Tamatori, a small village located in the Shizuoka prefecture, between Kyoto and Tokyo, surrounded by green tea plantations and rice fields, when he came across an elderly woman farming, and decided to approach her. “I said ‘Do you know if there are any empty houses around here?’ And she just pointed,” he recalls. He looked over at the area that she was signaling to and spotted two neglected houses side by side – a former green tea factory and an old farmer’s home – located close to a river. Both properties had been uninhabited for at least seven years and needed a huge amount of work. Kajiyama asked the woman to contact the owner to find out if they’d be interested in selling. “The owner said that no one could live there, as it was abandoned,” he says. “But he didn’t say ‘no.’ Everybody was always saying ‘no.’ But he didn’t. So I felt there was a small chance.” Expats buy Japanese country house for a song and get way more than they bargained for Kajiyama returned to visit the houses around five times, before going to visit the owner himself to negotiate an agreement that would see him use the old green tree factory as a home, and convert the farmer’s house into the guesthouse he’d always envisioned. While he was keen to purchase both of the homes, he explains that the traditions around home ownership in Japan mean that he is unable to do so until it’s passed down to the son of the current owner. “They said ‘if you take all the responsibility yourself, you can take it.’ So we made an agreement on paper,” he says. Both he and Hila were aware that they had a lot of work ahead of them, but the couple, who married in 2013, were thrilled to be one step closer to having their own guesthouse in an ideal spot. “It’s a very nice location,” says Kajiyama. “It’s close to the city, but it’s really countryside. Also people still live here and go to work [in the city]. “The house is also in front of the river, so when you go to sleep you can hear the sound of the water.” According to Kajiyama, the process of clearing the house, which is around 90 years old, before beginning the renovation works was one of the hardest parts of the process, simply because there was so much stuff to sort through. However, he was able to repurpose some of the items. During the first year, he spent a lot of time connecting with locals, gaining knowledge about the home, and helping the local farmers with farming for the first year or so. Although he wasn’t hugely experienced with renovation work, he had spent some time farming and completing building while he was backpacking, and had also taken odd jobs fixing peoples homes. He completed much of the work on the guesthouse himself, replacing the floors and adding in a toilet, which he says was a wedding present from his parents, at a cost of around $10,000. “I’m not really a professional,” he says.” I like to do carpentry and I enjoy creating things, but I have no experience in my background. “From my several years of backpacking, I saw so many interesting buildings, so many houses of interesting shapes and I’ve been collecting those in my brain.” Kajiyama was determined to keep the house as authentic as possible by using traditional materials. He saved money by collecting traditional wood from building companies who were in the process of breaking down traditional houses. “They need to spend the money to throw it away,” he explains. “But for me, some of the stuff is like treasure. So I would go and take the material that I wanted. “The house is a very, very old style,” he says. “So it wouldn’t look nice if I brought in more modern materials. It’s totally authentic.” He explains that very little work had previously been done to the house, which is quite unusual for a home built so many years ago. “It’s totally authentic,” he says. “Usually, with traditional houses, some renovations are made to the walls, because the insulation is not so strong. So you lose the style.” He says he received some financial support from the government, which meant he was able to bring in a carpenter and also benefited from Japan’s working holiday program, which allows travelers to work in exchange for food and board, when he needed extra help. After doing some research into Japanese guesthouse permits, he discovered that one of the simplest ways to acquire one would be to register the property as an agriculture guesthouse. As the area is filled with bamboo forests, this seemed like a no-brainer, and Kajiyama decided to learn everything he could about bamboo farming so that he could combine the two businesses. “This is how I started farming,” he says. In 2014, two years after they began working on the house, the couple were finally able to welcome their first guests. “It was a beautiful feeling,” says Kajiyama. “Of course, this was my dream. But people really appreciate that it was abandoned and I brought it back to life.” He says that hosting guests from all over the world has helped him to stay connected to his former life as a backpacker. “I stay in one place, but people come to me and I feel like I’m traveling,” he says. “Today, it’s Australia, tomorrow it’s the UK and next week South Africa and India. “People come from different places and they invite me to join them for dinner, so sometimes I join someone’s family life.” Sadly, Hila passed away from cancer in 2022. Kajiyama stresses that his beloved wife played a huge part in helping him achieve his dream of having a guesthouse and says he couldn’t have done it without her. “We were really together,” he adds. “She created this place with me. Without her it would not have been like this.” While the three-bedroom guesthouse, which measures around 80 square meters, has been open for around eight years, Kajiyama is still working on it, and says he has no idea when he’ll be finished. “It’s never ending,” he admits. “I’m halfway, I feel. It is beautiful already. But it started off abandoned, so it needs more details. And I’m getting better at creating, so I need time to do it.” He explains that he’s unable to complete work on the home while guests are there. And while the property is closed during the winter, he spends two months as a bamboo farmer and usually spends a month traveling, which doesn’t leave him much time for renovations. “Sometimes I don’t do anything,” he admits. Yui Valley, which offers activities such as bamboo weaving workshops, has helped to bring many travelers to the village of Tamatori over the years. “Most of the guests come after Tokyo, and it’s such a contrast,” he says. “They are really happy to share the nature and the tradition in our house. “Most people have dreamed of coming to Japan for a long time and they have a very short time here. “So they have such a beautiful energy. I’m happy to host in this way and join their holiday time. It’s very special [for me].” Kajiyama estimates that he’s spent around $40,000 on the renovation work so far, and if the feedback from guests, and locals, is anything to go by, it seems to have been money well spent. “People appreciate what I’ve done,” he adds. “So that makes me feel special.” As for Hiroko, the woman who pointed out the house to him over a decade ago, Kajiyama says she’s stunned at the transformation, and is amazed at how many international travelers are coming to Tamatori to stay at Yui Valley. “She cannot believe how much more beautiful it is [now],” he says. “She didn’t think it was going to be like this. So she really appreciates it. She says ‘thank you’ a lot.” Yui Valley, 1170 Okabecho Tamatori, Fujieda, Shizuoka 421-1101, Japan © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Due to its remoteness and short summer season, Mongolia has long been a destination overlooked by travelers. But as the country moves to further open up to tourism by easing its entry conditions for international visitors and upgrading its infrastructure, 2023 might just be the best time yet to get there. Here are 10 reasons travelers should start planning their long-dreamed-of Mongolia visit now. With the government of Mongolia declaring 2023 through 2025 the “Years to Visit Mongolia,” citizens from an additional 34 countries can now visit the country visa-free through the end of 2025. The addition of several European countries, including Denmark, France, Greece, Italy, Norway, Spain, and the UK, as well as Australia and New Zealand, now brings the total number of countries and territories on the visa-exempt list to 61. The full list is here. After years of delays, a pandemic and several controversies, the newly built Chinggis Khaan International Airport finally opened in the summer of 2021. With the ability to handle approximately 3 million passengers a year (double that of the old airport), the addition of 500 new aircraft parking spaces and the infrastructure to support an increase in domestic as well as budget flights, the airport is a welcome addition to the country’s efforts to grow tourism. Budget flights to Hong Kong from EZNIS Airways have been relaunched since the airport’s opening, and talks to resume direct flights to the United States are reportedly underway. The recently opened Chinggis Khaan Museum offers a beautiful, fresh look at Mongolia’s tumultuous history. With more than 10,000 artifacts spanning over 2,000 years, the museum explores the history of the Mongols and the empire they created – and eventually lost. The museum’s artifacts are presented over eight floors, with six permanent and two temporary exhibition halls. Guided tours are offered in English every Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. free of charge. When most people think of Mongolia, music festivals and conservation-focused art installations in the heart of one of the world’s largest deserts are the last things to come to mind. But that’s all changing thanks to festivals like Playtime, Spirit of Gobi, INTRO Electronic Music Festival and the Kharkhorum 360 Visual Art & Music Experience. Placing international bands, DJs, and musicians from around the world alongside Mongolia’s eclectic mix of rappers, bands and folk singers, the country just might be one of the world’s most underrated places for festival lovers. The annual Naadam event has always been a great reason to visit Mongolia, but now that the festival has just celebrated its 100 year anniversary, 2023 is as good a time as ever to attend. While the festival’s origins are rooted in the days of Genghis Khan, when he used horse racing, wrestling and archery competitions to keep his warriors in shape between battles, Naadam only officially became a national holiday 100 years ago. Today, the festival – held in Ulaanbaatar at the National Sports Stadium, has a few more bells and whistles than it did during the days of the Great Khan. A seat at July 11’s opening ceremony is always one of the hardest tickets to score in town. Mounted archery is seeing a resurgence in Mongolia thanks to guys like Altankhuyag Nergui, one of the most accomplished archers in the sport and his archery academy, Namnaa. Here, locals learn the fundamentals of Mongolian archery before mounting a horse and taking their new found skills to another level. In the summer months, students and academy members put on weekly shows for interested spectators. The academy also offers day-long training sessions for those wanting to try this intense sport. Speaking of giving life to Mongolia’s most ancient traditions, the resurrection of Mongol bichig, or the traditional Mongolian script written from top to bottom and read from left to right, has also seen a major resurgence in recent years. Visit the Erdenesiin Khuree Mongolian Calligraphy Center in Karakorum to learn from master calligraphist Tamir Samandbadraa Purev about this important cultural heritage. And, while you’re there, browse the yurts filled with Tamir’s works. Pair the release of Husqvarna’s new Norden 901 Expedition motorbike with Nomadic Off-Road’s newly announced Eagle Hunter Tour, and you have one of the fastest adventures in Mongolia. The tour takes six riders 1,700 kilometers from Ulaanbaatar to Bayan-Ulgii, where riders eventually meet their hosts, Mongolia’s famous eagle hunters. The only thing faster than this adventure is the rate at which Nomadic Off-Road’s tours sell out. Capturing the art of the last eagle hunters of Mongolia Professional musher Joel Rauzy has been leading dogsledding tours across the frozen Lake Khuvsgul for 18 years. With fewer crowds, lower hotel rates and the chance to see one of the largest freshwater lakes in the world completely frozen over, winter in Mongolia is something else to see and experience. Rauzy’s company, Wind of Mongolia, offers tours of the lake, where each person is assigned their own sled and dogs for the journey. Following Rauzy’s lead, mushers will make a loop of the lake. Activities include ice fishing, while travelers stay in winterized yurts and spend time with nomadic families along the journey. Nestled in the heart of Selenge province on the Yeruu River, Yeruu Lodge is the brainchild of Norwegian founder Eirik Gulsrud Johnsen, who first visited Mongolia in 2017. With a minimal Scandinavian-style restaurant and dining area, a handful of fully kitted out yurts for guests to stay in, two pétanque courts, kayaks, a driving range, mountain bikes and a yoga area, the lodge is a destination for nature lovers. Completely off-grid, the lodge runs off solar panels, uses of thermal heating, and all of the property’s water comes from an on-property well and is recycled after use. Additionally, all glass, metal and plastic used at the lodge is also recycled, and food waste is turned into compost used to grow vegetables, berries and herbs onsite. The lodge is set to open in April 2023. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved. CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."
1,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-03 04:52:58.000,The most beautiful sections of China's Great Wall,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/china-beautiful-great-wall-sections-cmd/index.html,2023-09-18 02:57:08.000,"Editor’s Note: Monthly Ticket is a CNN Travel series that spotlights some of the most fascinating topics in the travel world. In September, we’re celebrating superlatives as we look at some of the world’s biggest, tallest and most expensive attractions and destinations. Having lived in Beijing for almost 12 years, I’ve had plenty of time to travel widely in China. I’ve visited more than 100 cities, not to mention countless towns and villages throughout the mainland’s 31 provinces. Looking back, I’ve come to realize it was my frequent visits to different parts of the Great Wall in Beijing that were a driving force behind my desire to explore the rest of the country and, along with it, the many sections of wall that lie outside the capital’s boundaries. Work on the Great Wall began more than 2,500 years ago, its origins dating back to China’s Spring and Autumn Period of around 770 BCE to 476 BCE. Various sections were added in subsequent eras as competing dynasties and factions sought to exert their control. Work eventually stopped in the 17th century. What's it like to walk the entire length of China's Great Wall? Though not a single, unbroken structure, the wall spans over 21,000 kilometers, winding through 15 provinces, 97 prefectures and 404 counties. And while certain sections have been incredibly popular among tourists, many parts have slipped into obscurity, disrepair and sometimes oblivion. Whether you’re planning to visit the Great Wall for the first time or the 50th, the following destinations are sure to make your trip to China even more worthwhile. (Check out the above video for dramatic aerial footage of some of these amazing sites.) The Great Wall is not simply a brick and mortar bulwark; in certain places, towers on jagged mountain peaks, fortress towns or even wide rivers count as sections of “wall.” The Turtle City, built in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) as part of the Great Wall’s “Yellow River Defense Line,” was completed in 1608 and was home to around 2,000 infantrymen and 500 cavalry units during peak use. Today, this fortress city is located in the Sitan Township of Jingtai County in north central Gansu province. While there aren’t many real turtles in the “Turtle City,” the garrison town got its nickname due to its unique shape. The south gate acts as the head and the west and east gates as the flippers. The town’s oval wall is the body, while the north gate acts as its tail. As one of the most well-preserved and truly authentic walled cities left in China today, it’s definitely worth your time. Staying in the Jingtai County center is recommended. The ancient city is only a 30-minute cab ride from your lodgings, so you can visit whenever the light is best for photos. When in Jingtai, try local specialties such as the five Buddha tofu and the Jingtai cold mixed noodles – both are spicy vegetarian dishes. A walk through the sprawling night market in Jingtai County People’s Square, which boasts more than 50 snack stalls, is also recommended for adventurous foodies. Regional Chinese food: 8 lesser-known cuisines worth trying Getting there: Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu province, has a major international airport and high-speed train connections from many cities in China. The drive to Yongtai Turtle City from downtown Lanzhou takes about 2.5 hours (195 kilometers). From Lanzhou Zhongchuan Airport, it’s only 1.5 hours (125 kilometers). Mutianyu and Jiankou are two parts of the same Stone Dragon – two contiguous sections of the Great Wall that together stretch for roughly 25 kilometers along Beijing’s mountaintops. Historical records show that millions of men spent centuries constructing the Great Wall. Stand atop the wall at either Mutianyu or Jiankou, and you’ll begin to comprehend the gravity of this statement. These two sections are arguably the two most classic examples of Ming Dynasty Great Wall surviving today, and climbing either is guaranteed to be a life-changing experience. Mutianyu is the best portion of the “tourist wall.” Restored in the 1980s, it’s very commercial but also superbly beautiful. Visitors not up for the hike can take a cable car to the top. Off-the-radar destinations every visitor to China should consider To the west of Mutianyu, Jiankou is colloquially known as the “wild wall” – no ticket needed and not commercialized. That being said, as of 2020, hiking at Jiankou has become somewhat frowned upon by the local government because of safety concerns. Mutianyu and Jiankou are less than a 90-minute drive (without traffic) from downtown Beijing, yet it’s highly recommended to enjoy a night in the countryside if time allows. Jiankou can be accessed via Xizhazi village; if dates align, you might even be able to spend a few days with William Lindesay, world-renowned Great Wall historian, and his wonderful family at The Barracks, their wall-side courtyard home. For lodgings around Mutianyu, The Brickyard is a superbly comfortable choice. In fall and spring, shades of the wall’s gray brick contrast with nature’s vibrant colors. Peak autumn foliage and spring cherry blossoms provide stunning backdrops for photos. For winter sports enthusiasts, there’s skiing and skating next to the Wall at locations not far from Mutianyu. Getting to Mutianyu: Restrictions on applying for temporary driving licenses in China were relaxed in September 2019, so renting a car as a foreign tourist is entirely possible. (International driving licenses are not accepted in China.) You can also hire a car with a driver for the day or take the Mutianyu Special Tourism Bus from the Dongzhimen Wai Bus Station. Getting to Jiankou: Renting a car or booking private transport is recommended. As Xizhazi is a small village, buses are scarce so it can take up to five hours to get there by public transport, as opposed to 90 minutes by car. Bataizi village sits just inside the Motianling section of the Great Wall and is home to the ruins of a Gothic church built in 1876 under the direction of a German missionary. The church has been damaged and repaired numerous times in its nearly 150-year history; the bell tower is the only part still standing. The juxtaposition of its ruins against the rammed-earth Great Wall makes Bataizi a unique place to spend a morning or afternoon. China's best new outdoor attractions After finishing your hike along the wall and visiting the church ruins, drop in to the village’s “new” church to say hello to Father Pan; if you speak Chinese, he can answer any questions about the village’s long connection with Catholicism. Besides Bataizi, Datong should also be on your tourist map; visiting the Yungang Grottoes (a UNESCO world heritage site) and the Hengshan Hanging Temple will make your trip even more memorable. Late summer is an ideal time to visit Bataizi, as you’ll see a wonderful contrast between the Great Wall and the lush green hills. Getting there: Bataizi village is 80 kilometers west of Datong, one of Shanxi province’s largest and most famous cities. Zuoyun County is only 22 kilometers away from Bataizi – about a 35-minute drive. Datong is easily accessible by plane or high-speed train from other cities in China; a taxi from downtown Datong to Bataizi should cost roughly 300 yuan (about $43). Alternatively, you can make your way to Zuoyun County by bus then hop in a taxi. In Datong, luxury seekers will want to head for the five-star Yunzhong Traditional Courtyard Hotel. Zuoyun County has one hotel that can accept foreigners: Zuoyun Jinshan International Hotel. Both can be found on popular hotel booking sites. As the locals say, Laoniuwan is where the Great Wall and the mighty Yellow River shake hands. The Laoniuwan Fortress was built in 1467, while the most famous tower of the Great Wall in this area, Wanghe Tower (literally meaning river-watching tower), was constructed in 1544. Laoniuwan village is located in Pianguan County, part of Xinzhou city in Shanxi province, just across the river from Inner Mongolia. Late summer or early fall is a great time to visit, as you’ll avoid the potentially dangerous mountain roads during spring rainstorms, or being uncomfortably cold in a place without great infrastructure. Along the Great Wall, there are only a few places where it meets bodies of water; of all those, this is the most stunning. A boat ride along the river is highly recommended. You’ll be able to soak in the natural beauty of the Yellow River Gorge while marveling at the steadfast resolve of these ancient architects. Swell life: China's surf scene is heating up Getting there: Laoniuwan is difficult to get to by public transportation. The best option is to rent or book a car to take you from Datong to Laoniuwan via Bataizi – this way, you’ll be able to see two incredible locations along the Great Wall in one trip. Pianguan is the nearest city, about one hour away. Pianguan does not have a train station or an airport. The only option is to arrive by bus. Shuozhou, 140 kilometers from Laoniuwan, has an airport opening later this year. Construction on the Great Wall in Simatai began in 1373. It was expanded and reinforced periodically throughout the Ming Dynasty. The Fairy Tower is one of the best-known towers of the wall at Simatai but also one of the least visited due to how difficult it is to access. Instead, aim to take in incredible views of the Fairy Tower from Wangjing Tower (just a few hundred meters away). It’s a journey that will satiate even the most adventurous hikers, yet can be done without any ropes, ladders or other essential safety gear. As with a visit to Mutianyu/Jiankou, this section of wall is guaranteed to deliver stunning views any time of year. My only suggestion is to wait for a clear day (usually visibility is great the day after it rains or snows), as the view from Wangjing Tower is unobstructed in every direction. The hike to the Fairy Tower will leave you in awe of the Northern Barbarians’ supposed determination to reach the capital; the mountains are nearly impassable on foot, let alone by horse, with sheer cliff faces on either side. It makes for absolutely world-class hiking and an interesting history lesson. Five-star lodgings are available at Hobo Farm; they also have an incredible restaurant that serves delicious Western and Chinese fare. For 4.5 star lodgings with a lower price tag, try Yatou’s Homestay. Both can be found on major hotel booking sites. Getting there: Both the Fairy Tower and Wangjing Tower should be accessed via Tangjiazhai village, located in Beijing’s Miyun district. Tangjiazhai village is 140 kilometers from downtown Beijing, depending on your route. Booking a private car from the city is probably the most time-effective way to get there. You can also take a high-speed train from Beijing Station to Miyun district and switch to a bus or taxi from there. Constructed during the reign of Emperor Jiajing (1507-1567), this single-wall section stands seven meters tall in some spots – no small feat considering it was made by piling stones. It’s located just across the road from the town of Dushikou, in Chicheng in Hebei province. The piled-stone wall at Dushikou is unique, as many other sections of the Great Wall close to Beijing were constructed using kiln-fired bricks. Dushikou is best visited in the summer, specifically July and August, when the rolling hills of the surrounding grasslands are peak green. Cool evenings make for perfect outdoor barbecue/bonfire weather. You’ll be able to find clean and comfortable farmhouse lodgings in Dushikou town; alternatively, Chicheng, 45 minutes away, has a range of hotels to choose from. Lamb skewers and roast leg of lamb are specialties in these parts, as this part of Hebei is very close to the border with Inner Mongolia. Noodle lovers should also try the local oat noodles, which are delicious. Getting there: Thanks to all the infrastructure built for the 2022 Winter Olympics, the drive to Dushikou has been shortened by almost two hours. If you prefer not to drive, hop on a bus to Chicheng from the Liuliqiao Transport Hub in Beijing and take a 45-minute taxi ride to Dushikou. Note that public transportation will take one or two hours longer than private car. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

Related gallery Inside 2022's 'CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute' Online voters selected her from among this year’s Top 10 CNN Heroes. Cheboi’s nonprofit, TechLit Africa, has provided thousands of students across rural Kenya with access to donated, upcycled computers — and the chance at a brighter future. Cheboi accepted the award with her mother, who she said “worked really hard to educate us.” At the beginning of her acceptance speech, Cheboi and her mother sang a song onstage that she explained had a special meaning when she was growing up. As CNN Hero of the Year, Cheboi will receive $100,000 to expand her work. She and the other top 10 CNN Heroes honored at Sunday’s gala all receive a $10,000 cash award and, for the first time, additional grants, organizational training and support from The Elevate Prize Foundation through a new collaboration with CNN Heroes. Nelly will also be named an Elevate Prize winner, which comes with a $300,000 grant and additional support worth $200,000 for her nonprofit. Cheboi grew up in poverty in Mogotio, a rural township in Kenya. “I know the pain of poverty,” said Cheboi, 29. “I never forgot what it was like with my stomach churning because of hunger at night.” A hard-working student, Cheboi received a full scholarship to Augustana College in Illinois in 2012. She began her studies there with almost no experience with computers, handwriting papers and struggling to transcribe them onto a laptop. Related article This CNN Hero upcycles old computers to open new worlds for young Kenyans Everything changed in her junior year, though, when Cheboi took a programming course required for her mathematics major. “When I discovered computer science, I just fell in love with it. I knew that this is something that I wanted to do as my career, and also bring it to my community,” she told CNN. Many basic computer skills were still a steep learning curve, however. Cheboi remembers having to practice touch-typing for six months before she could pass a coding interview. Touch-typing is a skill that is now a core part of the TechLit curriculum. “I feel so accomplished seeing kids that are 7 years old touch-typing, knowing that I just learned how to touch-type less than five years ago,” she said. Once she had begun working in the software industry, Cheboi soon realized the extent of which computers were being thrown away as companies upgraded their technology infrastructure. Related video Watch Sofia Carson perform 'Applause' at CNN Heroes celebration “We have kids here (in Kenya) — myself included, back in the day — who don’t even know what a computer is,” she said. So, in 2018, she began transporting donated computers back to Kenya — in her personal luggage, handling customs fees and taxes herself. “At one point, I was bringing 44 computers, and I paid more for the luggage than I did for the air ticket,” she said. A year later, she co-founded TechLit Africa with a fellow software engineer after both quit their jobs. The nonprofit accepts computer donations from companies, universities and individuals. The hardware is wiped and refurbished before it’s shipped to Kenya. There, it’s distributed to partner schools in rural communities, where students ages 4 to 12 receive daily classes and frequent opportunities to learn from professionals, gaining skills that will help improve their education and better prepare them for future jobs. “We have people who own a specific skill coming in and are just inspiring the kids (with) music production, video production, coding, personal branding,” Cheboi said. “They can go from doing a remote class with NASA on education to music production.” The organization currently serves 10 schools; within the next year, Cheboi hopes to be partnered with 100 more. “My hope is that when the first TechLit kids graduate high school, they’re able to get a job online because they will know how to code, they will know how to do graphic design, they will know how to do marketing,” Cheboi said. “The world is your oyster when you are educated. By bringing the resources, by bringing these skills, we are opening up the world to them.” CNN’s Anderson Cooper and ABC’s Kelly Ripa co-hosted the 16th Annual “CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute,” which featured more than a dozen celebrity presenters. “We’re so deeply honored to be here,” said actress and singer Sofia Carson, who perfomed a song with award-winning songwriter Diane Warren at the event. “Diane wrote this incredible anthem ‘Applause’ for those leading, surviving and fighting and tonight we dedicate this song and performance to our heroes.” Actor Aubrey Plaza introduced CNN Hero Aidan Reilly, who launched his nonprofit while home from college during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic. “From his pandemic couch, Aidan and his friends co-founded Farmlink Project,” Plaza said. The nonprofit connects excess food from farms across the US – food that would otherwise be wasted – to those who need it. “In just two years, he .. has moved more than 70 million pounds,” Plaza added.

And Emmy award-winning actor Justin Theroux brought his rescue dog Kuma, on the stage to honor Carie Broecker ​​and her nonprofit, Peace of Mind Dog Rescue. Two teenagers making a difference in their communities were also honored as 2022 Young Wonders: Ruby Chitsey, a 15-year-old from Harrison, Arkansas, started “Three Wishes for Ruby’s Residents,” which donates personal items to nursing home residents who couldn’t otherwise afford them. Sri Nihal Tammana, a 13-year-old from Edison, New Jersey, started “Recycle My Battery,” which keeps used batteries out of the ecosystem through a network of collection bins. The show also honored two Georgia poll workers, Shaye Moss and her mother Ruby Freeman, whose lives were upended after false allegations that they had been involved in election fraud spread on social media. CNN has partnered with GoFundMe to enable donations to this year’s Top 10 honorees. GoFundMe is the world’s largest fundraising platform that empowers people and charities to give and receive help. Supporters can make online donations to the Top 10 CNN Heroes’ non-profit organizations directly from CNNHeroes.com.

If you need a 0% intro APR for as long as possible, then the Wells Fargo Reflect® Card is worth getting. It gives you plenty of time to pay off purchases and balance transfers without incurring interest charges. Those who can make do with a shorter intro APR period should look for cards with more benefits, such as cash rewards and a welcome offer. The nice thing about credit cards with a 0% intro APR is that it's easy to compare them. The key factor is how long the intro rate lasts -- on purchases, balance transfers, or both, depending on what you need the card for. For example, if you have a lot of debt and are looking for a way to refinance it, then you'd probably want to go with the card that has the longest 0% intro APR on balance transfers. Wells Fargo has done a great job in this regard. Not only does this card have a lengthy introductory period, it applies to purchases and balance transfers. Want to know what other sites and real cardholders think of the Wells Fargo Reflect® Card? Here's what we found. Average competitor rating: 4.1 / 5 stars After reading reviews from five other top sites, there's a pretty clear consensus about this Wells Fargo card. We all agree that the 0% intro APR offer is excellent, making it one of the best credit cards for avoiding interest, and that the cellphone protection is a valuable extra. Everyone's in agreement about this card's drawbacks, too: Lack of rewards, a high balance transfer fee, and a foreign transaction fee. The only difference of opinion is the overall rating each of us gave this card. The Wells Fargo Reflect® Card hasn't exactly set the social media world on fire, but responses have generally been positive. It's widely recognized as an excellent 0% intro APR and balance transfer card. Some cardholders have called out the balance transfer fee of 5%, min: $5, since that's more than the 3% charged by several other cards. But they also acknowledge that 21 months from account opening is a long time to pay off credit card debt. If you need to avoid interest charges for as long as possible, look no further. The Wells Fargo Reflect® Card has a 0% intro APR on purchases and qualifying balance transfers for 21 months from account opening. That's nearly two years where you won't be paying credit card interest. Balance transfers made within the first 120 days qualify for the intro rate. After the intro period ends, the go-to 18.24%, 24.74%, or 29.99% Variable APR applies on your card's balance going forward. This is the longest 0% intro APR I've seen. Since it applies to purchases and balance transfers, there are all kinds of ways to use it. You could: Considering how much smartphones cost, and the many hazards they seem to face, it's a good idea to have yours insured. They may seem affordable when you're paying them off across 24 monthly payments. When you lose one and need to pay MSRP for a new iPhone, that's when you realize it costs about as much as a rent payment. If you have this card and use it to pay your monthly cellphone bill, you won't need to shell out extra for insurance. It has complimentary cellphone protection of up to $600, with a $25 deductible. This covers damage, theft, and involuntary or accidental parting (when you know where your phone is, but it's impractical to recover it). The biggest drawback with this card is that it doesn't offer any sort of rewards program. That means: To be fair, this card has special offers through My Wells Fargo Deals, where you can earn cash back statement credits on shopping, dining, and experiences you pay for with your eligible Wells Fargo card. But earning some statement credits here and there isn't nearly as valuable as earning cash rewards on all your everyday purchases. Because of the lack of rewards, this card doesn't have much long-term value. Once the 0% intro APR ends, there's no incentive to continue using it. You're better off switching to a rewards credit card at that point. It's worth noting that there are 0% APR credit cards that also have rewards programs. They just have shorter 0% APR intro periods. If you don't need the entire 21 months from account opening this Wells Fargo card offers, then it could make more sense to pick a card with a shorter intro period that earns rewards. The Wells Fargo Reflect® Card is a great balance transfer card because of its 0% intro APR. But it also has a balance transfer fee of 5%, min: $5. Balance transfer cards normally have a fee like this, but some of them only charge 3%. It may not seem like much, but if you're transferring $5,000, that 2% difference would cost you an extra $100. If you don't need 21 months from account opening to get out of debt, you may want to look at more credit card reviews and pick a card with a lower balance transfer fee. There's also a foreign transaction fee of 3%, which is another reason why this isn't the best card for long-term use. If you ever travel outside the United States, it's important to have a card you can use without any extra fees, like a travel credit card A FICO® Score of 670 or higher, which is considered good credit, is suggested to apply for the Wells Fargo Reflect® Card. Keep in mind that credit card applications depend on many factors, including your income and other parts of your financial profile. Wells Fargo offers an online prequalification tool. All you need to do is provide some basic information, and you'll see any prequalified credit card offers you have with Wells Fargo, which may or may not include the Wells Fargo Reflect® Card. The Wells Fargo Reflect® Card has a 0% intro APR for 21 months from account opening on purchases and qualifying balance transfers. Balance transfers made within 120 days from account opening qualify for the introductory rate. Here are the fees for the Wells Fargo Reflect® Card: The minimum credit limit on the Wells Fargo Reflect® Card is $1,000. It's possible to get a much larger amount -- some cardholders have reported being approved for limits of over $25,000. When you're approved for this card, Wells Fargo sets a credit limit based on several factors, primarily your income and credit history. If you want to earn cash rewards: The Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card earns an unlimited 2% cash rewards on purchases and has a $200 cash rewards welcome bonus for spending $500 in the first three months. This card's intro APR doesn't last as long, but if you don't need as long as 21 months, then its cash rewards could make it a better choice. If you want a lower balance transfer fee: The Citi Double Cash® Card has a balance transfer fee of 3% ($5 min.) on transfers in the first four months, 5% ($5 min.) thereafter. Those transfers also qualify for a 0% intro APR for 18 months. If you can pay off your debt within a year and a half, this card is a good choice, because you'll save money on fees.

2,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-03 05:36:43.000,Plea deal with accused 9/11 plotters revoked,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7202593k0xo,2024-08-03 03:19:06.000,"US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has revoked a pre-trial agreement reached with men accused of plotting the 11 September terrorist attacks. In a memo on Friday, Mr Austin also said he was revoking the authority of the officer overseeing the military court who signed the agreement on Wednesday. The original deal, which would reportedly have spared the alleged attackers the death penalty, was criticised by some families of victims. The memo named five defendants including the alleged ringleader of the plot, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, all of whom are held in Guantánamo Bay. The original deal named three men. ""I have determined that, in light of the significance of the decision to enter into pre-trial agreements with the accused… responsibility for such a decision should rest with me as the superior authority,"" Mr Austin wrote to Brig Gen Susan Escallier. ""I hereby withdraw your authority. Effective immediately, in the exercise of my authority, I hereby withdraw from the three pre-trial agreements."" The White House said on Wednesday that it had played no role in the plea deal. The five men named in the memo were: Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, often referred to as KSM, Walid Muhammad Salih Mubarak bin Attash, Mustafa Ahmed Adam al-Hawsawi; and two others not mentioned in the original plea: Ramzi bin al-Shibh and Ali Abdul Aziz Ali. The men have been in custody for decades without trial. All have alleged they were tortured - KSM was subjected to simulated drowning, so-called ""waterboarding"", 183 times before it was banned by the US government. All have already faced more than a decade of pre-trial hearings, complicated by the allegations and evidence of torture against them. Several family members of victims had criticised the terms of the deal struck on Wednesday as too lenient. Brett Eagleson, the president of 9/11 Justice, which represents survivors and relatives of victims, had told the BBC earlier this week that the families were ""deeply troubled by these plea deals"". Terry Strada, who lost her husband Tom, told the BBC's Today Programme: ""It was a gut-punch to hear that there was a plea deal today that was giving the detainees in Guantanamo Bay what they want."" A lawyer at Guantanamo representing Mr Mohammed told The New York Times that he was shocked by the sudden u-turn. “If the secretary of defence issued such an order, I am respectfully and profoundly disappointed that after all of these years the government still has not learned the lessons of this case,” said lawyer Gary Sowards. “And the mischief that results from disregarding due process and fair play.” The men have been accused of a litany of charges, including attacking civilians, murder in violation of the laws of war, hijacking and terrorism. In September, the Biden administration reportedly rejected the terms of a plea deal with five men held at the US Navy base in Cuba, including Mohammed. The men had reportedly sought a guarantee from the president that they would not be kept in solitary confinement and would have access to trauma treatment. KSM is alleged to have brought the idea of hijacking and flying planes into buildings to al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. He was captured in Pakistan in 2003 along with Hawsawi, a Saudi who was an alleged fundraiser. Ali, a computer scientist and nephew of KSM, is accused of providing technical support to the 9/11 operation. Bin al-Shibh, a Yemeni, allegedly co-ordinated the attacks and had planned to be a hijacker but could not secure a US visa. Bin Attash, also a Yemeni, is accused of bombing the USS Cole in Yemen in 2000, which killed 17 sailors, and involvement in the 11 September attacks. Several Republicans applauded the defence secretary for revoking the deal. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson said the ""Biden-Harris Administration is correct to reverse course"", which he said followed Republicans ""launching investigations into this terrible plea deal"". ""Now deliver long awaited justice for 9/11 families,"" he said. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham said the decision ""exercised good command judgement"". ""The previous plea deal would have sent absolutely the wrong signal to terrorists throughout the world,"" he added. Earlier on Friday, Republican Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee Mike Rogers demanded answers from Mr Austin on how the deal was struck. “This deal signals willingness to negotiate with terrorists who deliberately harm Americans,” he wrote in a letter to the defence secretary. The 9/11 attacks in New York, Virginia and Pennsylvania sparked the ""War on Terror"" and the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. They were the deadliest assault on US soil since the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, where 2,400 people were killed.

2,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-03 05:36:43.000,Kamala Harris formally chosen as Democratic nominee,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ng1my55vno,2024-08-02 17:26:34.000,"US Vice-President Kamala Harris has passed the threshold to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination in a vote of party delegates. Speaking by telephone, Ms Harris said she was ""honoured to be the presumptive nominee"" as the virtual roll call continues ahead of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago later this month. Ms Harris is the first black woman and first South Asian woman to become the White House standard-bearer for a major US political party. If she defeats Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, in November she would be America's first female president. She ran unopposed in the virtual roll call after President Joe Biden stepped aside last month and quickly endorsed her. Several potential rivals followed his lead. On Friday afternoon, Ms Harris formally became the nominee after securing the support of 2,350 delegates, the threshold required to earn the nomination. ""We believe in the promise of America and that’s what this campaign is about,"" she said in brief remarks by phone as she crossed the benchmark. ""We are in this, we are on the road and it's not going to be easy, but we’re going to get this done."" In total, Democrats have said 3,923 delegates - or 99% of the participants - plan to vote for her. The rollcall began on Thursday and ends on Monday. Presidential and vice-presidential nominees are typically anointed at their party conventions, but the relatively late date of the 2024 DNC risks falling afoul of state ballot access laws. Ms Harris, 59, was born in Oakland, California, and is the first Democratic nominee in the party's nearly 200-year history to hail from a western state. She rose through the ranks of state politics from San Francisco district attorney to California attorney general and then US senator. Before dropping out of the race, Mr Biden had easily won the Democratic primary. He did not face stiff opposition despite voter concerns about his age and had won backing from 99% of pledged DNC delegates. But the 81-year-old faced escalating pressure from within the party to withdraw after a poor June debate performance against Trump. The decision to hold a virtual nominating process ahead of the 19-22 August convention was made while Mr Biden was still the presumptive candidate. It came in response to rules for ballot access in the state of Ohio, which requires that candidates for the November ballot be formally selected 90 days before the election - or by 7 August. Republican leaders in the state had warned they would enforce the law and, though lawmakers eventually created an exemption as they have done in the past, Democrats said an early rollcall would pre-empt further risks of their candidates being excluded from the ballot. Delegates do not need to vote on the vice-presidential pick. Ms Harris is expected to name her running mate by Monday. The Trump campaign and some Republicans have criticised the replacement of Mr Biden with Ms Harris, arguing she is the first major party candidate to secure the nomination without holding a press conference or a sit-down interview. Some have referred to the substitution as a ""coup"". But Ms Harris has hit the campaign trail hard since Mr Biden's endorsement, making the case against Trump in multiple campaign rallies and fundraisers across battleground states. On Friday, the campaign announced it had raised more than $310m (£242m) in the month of July, with more than two-thirds of people donating money for the first time. That figure is more than double the $138m raised by the Trump campaign last month and marks the biggest haul of the 2024 election cycle so far. US defence secretary Lloyd Austin says he did not agree to deal and relieves officer overseeing court of authority. Pentagon announces Middle East reinforcements as Iran says it will ""punish"" Israel for assassination of Hamas leader. With no woman having served as president, the state run by women could offer pointers for a route to the White House. The daughter of an Indian-born mother and Jamaican-born father, Kamala Harris began her career as a prosecutor.

2,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-03 05:36:43.000,US deploys jets and warships as Iran threatens Israel,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw5y5637eqdo,2024-08-02 23:34:30.000,"The United States will deploy additional warships and fighter jets to the Middle East to help defend Israel from possible attacks by Iran and its proxies, the Pentagon said. Tensions remain high in the region over the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran and a key commander of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. Missile defence forces were placed on a state of increased readiness to deploy, the Pentagon said, adding that its commitment to defend Israel was ""ironclad"". Iran's leader Ayatollah Khamenei has vowed ""harsh punishment"" against Israel for the assassination of Haniyeh, and declared three days of national mourning. The Hamas leader was killed in Tehran on Wednesday. Iran and its proxy in Gaza blamed the attack on Israel, which has not commented. Haniyeh, 62, was widely considered Hamas's overall leader and played a key role in negotiations aimed at reaching a ceasefire in the Gaza war. His death came just hours after Israel claimed it killed Fuad Shukr, the top military commander of Iran's proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah. A Pentagon statement said the new deployments would ""improve US force protection... increase support for the defence of Israel, and ... ensure the US is prepared to respond to various contingencies"". The deployments would include additional ballistic missile defense-capable cruisers and destroyers, it said. The US military had also intensified deployments before 13 April, when Iran launched an attack on Israel with drones and missiles. Israel and its allies shot down almost all of roughly 300 drones and missiles that were fired. Israel has not commented directly on the strike which killed Haniyeh. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country had delivered ""crushing blows"" to its enemies in recent days, including the killing of Shukr in Beirut. He warned Israelis that ""challenging days lie ahead... we have heard threats from all sides. We are prepared for any scenario"". Earlier, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said the US did not believe escalation was inevitable. ""I think we are being very direct in our messaging that certainly we don't want to see heightened tensions and we do believe there is an off-ramp here and that is that ceasefire deal,"" Singh said. An Israeli delegation will travel to Cairo in coming days for negotiations to reach a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal, Mr Netanyahu said on Friday. Hamas sparked the war with its 7 October attack on Israel, which killed 1,200 people. Israel responded with an ongoing military operation in Gaza that has killed almost 40,000 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.  US defence secretary Lloyd Austin says he did not agree to deal and relieves officer overseeing court of authority.

2,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-03 05:36:43.000,Why Putin thinks he's the winner in prisoner swap,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cmj2jlgr65do,2024-08-02 13:22:57.000,"It’s something Vladimir Putin does rarely: go to the airport to meet people off a plane. Personally. But he was there last night: on the tarmac at Moscow’s Vnukovo Airport to meet and greet those Russians whose release he’d secured from foreign jails; part of the largest prisoner swap between Russia and the West since the Cold War. Out of the plane and down the steps came 10 people, including spies, sleeper agents and a convicted assassin. “Congratulations on your return to the Motherland!” he told them. You could tell that the Kremlin believes it has something to celebrate. For the returning Russians there was a red carpet reception and a guard of honour. There were bouquets of flowers and - for some - hugs from the president. Mr Putin embraced Vadim Krasikov, the FSB hitman who’d been serving a life sentence in Germany for assassinating a Georgian-born Chechen dissident. President Putin promised them all state awards. “I would like to address those of you who have a direct connection to military service,” he continued. “Thank you for your loyalty to your oath and your duty to your Motherland, which has never forgotten you for a moment.” There’s another message the pro-Kremlin press is putting out right now: good riddance to those Russia has freed from its prisons and who’ve been flown abroad. “Eight Russians who’d been jailed in Nato countries have returned to the Motherland in exchange for individuals who had been acting to the detriment of Russia’s national security,” says the government paper. Referring to the dissidents released by Moscow, Komsomolskaya Pravda claims “they have ditched their former Motherland and flown to those who hired them.” Attempts to discredit critics and opponents; lavish praise for loyal supporters who are portrayed as true patriots. All this helps the authorities make the case with the Russian people that the prisoner swap was a success for the Kremlin. There is little doubt that the Kremlin views the prisoner swap as a victory for Moscow. It got what it wanted… it got its agents back, including the man who was No.1 on its wish list, Krasikov. The German authorities had initially been unwilling to release a convicted assassin, who a German court had concluded had acted on behalf of the Russian authorities. That reluctance softened as a wider deal took shape. But why was it so important for the Kremlin to secure Vadim Krasikov’s release and to bring him home? Today’s Russian newspapers provide a clue. “We’re returning our guys” is the headline in the government paper Rossiyskaya Gazeta, “We don’t abandon our own!” declares the pro-Putin tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda. That is precisely the message the Kremlin wants to send to its agents and spies: if we send you on missions abroad, and things go wrong, we’ll find a way of getting you home. The deal between Russia and the West followed a tumultuous, dramatic path until its completion on Thursday. The signs were there that an East-West prisoner exchange was being discussed behind the scenes. Hungarian PM Viktor Orban sparked anger last week by accusing the EU of pursuing a ""pro-war policy"". Since the invasion of Ukraine, the measures used to clamp down on Kremlin critics have swelled. Vadim Shamarin oversaw military communications when he was accused of taking bribes from a factory.

2,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-03 05:36:43.000,Freed Russian dissidents refused to sign plea for mercy from Putin,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpe3ed2ejglo,2024-08-02 21:45:41.000,"Two Russian dissidents released in a prisoner swap on Thursday have said they refused to sign a petition for mercy to be sent to Russian President Vladimir Putin as requested by prison officials. During a news conference in Germany, Vladimir Kara-Murza and Ilya Yashin said they did not admit guilt nor give Russian officials their consent to be removed, and vowed to return home one day. Mr Kara-Murza said the deal had saved ""16 human lives"" and that he had been convinced he would die in prison. He added that many Russians were ""opposed to Putin's war in Ukraine"". The two men were released as part of the exchange, which saw 24 people jailed in seven different countries exchanged. Those released by Russia included US journalist Evan Gerschkovich and former Marine Paul Whelan. The Russians released by Western nations included convicted assassin Vadim Krasikov, who had been serving a life sentence in Germany for killing a Georgian-born Chechen dissident in a Berlin park. On Friday, Mr Kara-Murza and Mr Yashin - along with a third dissident, Andrei Pivovarov - pledged to continue working towards a ""free"" Russia and advocating on behalf of political prisoners still being held there. Mr Yashin said he had ""conflicting feelings"" about the swap. While he expressed gratitude for those who worked to free him, he said his first desire when he arrived in Germany was to buy a ticket to return to Russia. Mr Yashin told the BBC that it was ""much more comfortable"" for Mr Putin to have an exiled opposition ""because the voice of opposition in prison always has much more weight than the voice in emigration"". “I never imagined myself outside Russia,"" he said. ""I am eternally grateful for their help. But I am a guest here - and my main wish is to return to Russia."" He added: ""I’m not the only one who demanded not to be sent into exile... but no-one asked our opinion."" However, he acknowledged that his return to Russia would make it more difficult to negotiate the exchange of other political prisoners and could intensify criticism of the German government, which he said had faced an ""ethical dilemma"" in releasing Krasikov. Russian rights group Memorial says hundreds of political prisoners are currently held in prison. While Mr Pivovarov argued the latest swap was a ""sign of light"" for them that release was possible, Mr Kara-Murza said the exchange was a ""drop in the ocean, because so many innocent people who've never committed a crime in their life are being held in torturous conditions"". Mr Kara-Murza, a dual Russian and British citizen, said he was held in solitary confinement for more than 10 months - and was only able to talk to his wife over the phone once during two-and-a-half years of imprisonment. ""I did not believe I would ever see my wife again,"" he recalled. ""I did not believe I'd ever see my family again and this feels really surreal. This feels like a film."" The political activist said he thought he might be shot on the day of his release - only realising what was happening when he saw the other imprisoned dissidents. He recounted how, sitting on the plane out of Russia, a man he identified as a government agent told him it was the last time he would see his homeland. Mr Kara-Murza said he responded: ""I know that I will be back in my home country."" Sasha Skochilenko, another Russian dissident and artist among those freed told BBC Newshour that she also believed she was going to be killed on the day of her release. Ms Skochilenko said she was in ""shock"" and ""on adrenaline"" as a now-free woman. ""I'm so glad, I'm so happy and I'm so grateful"", she continued. ""I'm finally with my beloved family, with my girlfriend, my fiancée. We're going to marry. We finally can do it in Germany... This is the happiest day of my life"". The freed dissidents also paid tribute to Alexei Navalny, a leading critic of Mr Putin who died in prison in February after Russian officials said he became unwell. The White House said on Thursday that Mr Navalny had been due to be included in a deal. Mr Yashin said: ""The fact that Alexei Navalny is not with us is a crime committed by Putin, who bears direct responsibility for his murder."" Mr Kara-Murza said he wanted ""to remind people in democratic countries that Russia and Putin are not the same thing"". ""I will absolutely carry on,"" he told the BBC following the news conference. ""I care about my country - and I think Russia deserves better than a corrupt KGB dictator. I want to make sure that Russia becomes... a normal, modern, democratic country."" The president is using his final months in office to take a victory lap after weeks of personal and political turmoil. Eight Russian prisoners were released in the swap, including spies, agents and a convicted assassin. US President Joe Biden welcomed them off the plane at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. The prisoner exchange between Russia and Western countries is the biggest since the Cold War. Evan Gershkovich, Paul Whelan and Alsu Kurmasheva were among the Americans freed in the prisoner swap.

Funeral prayers were held at Qatar’s Imam Muhammed bin Abdul Wahhab mosque - the largest in the country - before his body was taken in a coffin draped in the Palestinian flag for burial at a cemetery in Lusail, a city north of Doha. Several foreign officials were present at the funeral, including Turkey’s Vice-President Cevdet Yilmaz and Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan. Haniyeh was killed during a visit to Iran’s capital. Iran and its allies have blamed Israel, though Israel has not claimed responsibility for his death. The funeral, a high-security affair, was attended by prominent figures from both Hamas and their Palestinian rivals Fatah - as well as members of the public. Hamas officials had earlier stood on the tarmac at Doha Airport as the plane carrying Haniyeh’s coffin landed from the Iranian capital Tehran on Thursday afternoon. Turkey and Pakistan announced a day of mourning on Friday in honour of Haniyeh, while Hamas has called for ""roaring anger marches... from every mosque"" to take place after Friday prayers to protest Haniyeh's killing. At a separate funeral ceremony for Haniyeh which took place in Tehran on Thursday, Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, led the prayers. He had earlier vowed that Israel would suffer a “harsh punishment” for the killing. Haniyeh had been based in Doha since about 2019. The Hamas political office moved to the Qatari capital in 2012, following the closure of its previous office in Damascus, Syria. Haniyeh had played a key role in indirect talks with Israel over a potential ceasefire deal for the war in Gaza. The heads of the CIA, Mossad and the intelligence services of Egypt and Qatar had attended negotiations in Doha Haniyeh’s burial caps a week of soaring tensions in the Middle East, which escalated with the killing of 12 children and teenagers in a strike on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Israel accused Hezbollah and vowed “severe” retaliation, though Hezbollah denied it was involved. Days later, senior Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr was killed in a targeted Israeli air strike in Beirut. Four others, including two children, were also killed. Hours after that, Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Iran, Hamas's main backer. He was visiting to attend the inauguration of Iran's new president, Masoud Pezeshkian. Israel has not claimed responsibility for the assassination, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said afterward that Israel delivered “crushing blows” to Iran’s proxy groups in recent days. A senior Hamas official told the BBC the killing took place in the same building where Haniyeh had stayed during previous visits to Iran. Three Hamas leaders and a number of guards were with him in the same building, they said. The killing of Haniyeh left the leadership of Hamas in “a state of shock”, top Hamas officials told the BBC. The circumstances around his death remain unclear. Khalil al-Hayya, a senior Hamas official, told a news conference that a missile hit Haniyeh ""directly"", citing witnesses who were with him. But a report in the New York Times, which cites seven officials, says Haniyeh was killed by a bomb that had been smuggled two months ago into the building where he was staying. The BBC has not been able to verify either of these claims. Pentagon announces Middle East reinforcements as Iran says it will ""punish"" Israel for assassination of Hamas leader. The US president made the criticism in his first comments on the apparent Israeli assassination.

2,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-03 05:36:43.000,Dozens of children killed in Bangladesh protests - Unicef,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c16j6w1dxl1o,2024-08-02 17:21:33.000,"At least 32 children have died during student protests that engulfed Bangladesh last month, the UN's children's agency has said. The youngest child killed had yet to turn five years old, a Unicef spokesperson said, adding that most of those who died were bystanders. They were among more than 200 people who were killed during demonstrations against job quotas in the civil service, according to figures verified by BBC Bangla. The quota system has now been scaled back by the government following a Supreme Court ruling, but students have continued protesting - now demanding justice for those who died or have been injured or detained. While the protests are now smaller in scale, the government is struggling to control the rising tide of anger over how it initially responded to the demonstrations. ""Why are our brothers in graves and the killers outside?"" asked a crowd which had gathered outside the largest mosque in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, following Friday prayers, according to the AFP news agency. Security forces responded to the thousands who filled the streets with tear gas and rubber bullets, according to Reuters news agency. It reported that at least 20 people were injured. Sanjay Wijesekera, Unicef's regional director for south Asia, said he had been made aware of reports of children being detained during a visit to Bangladesh this week. He added that the 32 deaths the organisation had confirmed were ""a terrible loss"". A spokesperson for the UN agency said most of those killed were aged 13 or older, with one under five and one child aged between six and 12. ""Children must be protected at all times,"" Mr Wijesekera said. ""That is everyone’s responsibility."" Bangladeshi junior Information Minister Mohammad Ali Arafat responded that the government had no information regarding Unicef's death toll. ""We don’t know where they [Unicef] got the numbers from,"" he told the BBC, adding: ""Our position is clear: Whoever has been killed, we are going to investigate and bring the perpetrators to book."" Security forces have been accused of using excessive force to quell the initial protests, with many of the dead and injured suffering gunshot wounds, according to doctors who spoke to the BBC. But the government - which has said a number of police officers were also killed - has blamed political opponents for the unrest. On Thursday, it banned the country's main Islamist party - Jamaat-e-Islami and its student wing, Islami Chhatra Shibir - which it claimed was behind some of the violence. ""We have evidence that they have participated in the killings and in the destruction of government and private properties,"" Anisul Huq, Bagladesh's law minister, told the BBC. The opposition party's leader described the move as ""illegal, extrajudicial and unconstitutional"". Leaders of the student protest were also detained for a week - something done for their own protection, officials claimed. However, their release on Thursday has done little to dampen the outrage. In a joint statement released on Friday, the students questioned the grounds on which they were held. The group alleged ""harassment, torture and drama"" towards them and their families during their seven days of detention. ""No one is safe in the custody of those who kill unarmed students and citizens,"" the statement said, as it urged people to continue taking to the streets. Nearly 10,000 people have reportedly been detained since the authorities began their crackdown on the protests. But Mr Arafat rebuffed the statement by the student leaders. He said the authorities had to take the student leaders into custody because the government was aware of a potential threat to their lives. ""Their protection became our top priority,"" he added. More than 200 people have been killed in recent weeks after a crackdown on demonstrations. Aminan Rahman, 46, attacked Suma Begum, 24, during a video call with her boyfriend last April A UN expert describes the violence seen in videos analysed by the BBC as ""unlawful"". They were being treated for injuries they say were sustained after police tortured them in detention. Many said she did not appear to express the same level of sympathy towards those who had died.

2,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-03 05:36:43.000,'Still alive' - graduate Asmaa's texts to BBC from the ruins of Gaza,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c728vj21qepo,2024-08-02 23:06:33.000,"For six years the BBC’s Paul Adams has been in contact with a young graduate in Gaza. Her text messages give a unique insight into the terrors and small triumphs she has experienced during the current conflict, and her fears for the future. My phone lights up. It is Asmaa. “Still alive,” she writes. It is 19 March 2024 and after several weeks of silence, Asmaa Tayeh has reappeared on WhatsApp. “Sorry. Bad internet connection and dangerous days.” And then silence. For another two months. It has been like this since 7 October. Long disappearances, punctuated by flurries of text messages, as the 28-year-old emerges, briefly, amid the nightmare of Gaza’s longest war. It is always late at night. Somewhere, Asmaa has found a signal. Far away in London, my phone pings as the messages tumble in. I met Asmaa in 2018. I was in Gaza, reporting on daily protests at the border fence with Israel, where thousands of mostly young Palestinians angrily commemorated their ancestors’ displacement during Israel’s War of Independence, 70 years earlier. Asmaa was not part of the protests. I found her at her family’s home a few miles away in Jabalia, quietly writing stories, some of which I had read online, about daily life in a place she both loved and hated. Her laptop was a cherished portal to the world outside. She had only ever known the Gaza Strip and its stifling sense of isolation. From her spartan room, she watched vloggers and Youtubers casually exploring places she could only dream of. As a recent graduate in a place with few job prospects and frequent outbreaks of extreme violence, the exotic images flashing onto her computer screen were intoxicating but painful. “They show me how handcuffed I am,” she wrote that year. A refugee camp of tents and tin shacks in the 1950s, Jabalia had long since morphed into a small city, more than 100,000 people crammed together in a place of tall buildings, teeming alleyways and open sewers. Despite her narrow confines, the young Asmaa was hopeful. In September 2022, she launched her own business, Star Café, an online coffee delivery service. Her social media feeds suggested an optimistic young entrepreneur, finally achieving long-cherished goals and planning for the future. A year later, on 6 October 2023, in an Instagram post artfully depicting her branded products alongside a vase of roses and a manicured hand, she thanked God for “the blessing of self-employment”. But what she didn’t know was that a meteor was hurtling in her direction, about to obliterate everything. The following day, Hamas gunmen stormed across the border fence, killing about 1,200 Israelis and foreigners in nearby communities and at the Nova music festival. Israel’s response was like nothing Gazans had ever seen before. Its military would go on to kill tens of thousands of people, displace more than 80% of the population, and render large parts of the Gaza Strip uninhabitable. Three days later, on 10 October, Asmaa got in touch. “Hey Paul. It’s nice to hear from you. We are unharmed,” she messaged. “But to be honest, I don’t feel safe at all. We could be bombed at any minute.” Despite hearing airstrikes hitting nearby targets, Asmaa was hopeful the war would soon be over. But this was not a repeat of earlier Gaza wars. Within days, Israeli planes dropped leaflets, telling everyone in the northern Gaza Strip - more than one million people - to move south. Jabalia started to empty, but Asmaa’s family - 13 people spanning three generations - stayed put, fearing going south would prove a one-way journey. For the descendants of refugees who were forced or fled from their homes in 1948, never to return, the thought of history repeating itself stirred deep fears. Only her grandparents, elderly and frail, travelled, eventually finding shelter in Rafah. With electricity cut, food in freezers spoiling, and communications increasingly difficult, the family used a small generator every couple of days to charge mobiles and monitor the news. Asmaa’s messages were becoming increasingly sporadic. “It’s dangerous all over the Gaza Strip,” she told me on 15 October. At the end of October, Jabalia experienced its worst airstrikes so far. Israel said it had targeted underground Hamas structures and killed large numbers of fighters. The scenes were apocalyptic, with civilians and rescue workers searching for survivors through vast craters and wrecked buildings. Asmaa vanished. My WhatsApp messages were no longer being read. I assumed the worst. But six weeks later, she suddenly reappeared. “I’m still alive, by God’s miracles,” she wrote on 12 December. It did, indeed, feel miraculous. In a torrent of messages that followed, Asmaa described the previous chaotic weeks. The family’s reluctant decision to leave Jabalia, efforts to head south thwarted by the intensity of the fighting, terrifying journeys through a city at war. “I saw so much that I cannot find words to describe,” she said. “The streets are scary and the smell of death is everywhere. People are getting skinny and sick. I feel like I’m living inside a horror movie.” When forced to walk, the family would spread out along the road, hoping this would improve their chances of survival. “We kept distance between us, so if any air strike comes, not all of us will die.” During a week-long ceasefire in late November, the family had briefly returned to the house in Jabalia. The top floor was gone. Asmaa’s own room, which had doubled up as her Star Café office and studio, was pockmarked by shrapnel. When the ceasefire collapsed on 1 December, they fled once more, finding refuge in a printing shop in Gaza City where one of Asmaa’s brothers had worked before the war. It was filthy, reeked of paint, and had no kitchen, mattresses, or water. “We basically lived with rats,” she says. When it was safe enough to go outside, they would walk, sometimes for hours, searching for clean water - especially vital to make up the formula for Asmaa’s two-month-old nephew. But after less than three weeks in the shop, Asmaa got a phone call from the Israeli army. She was used to the army’s recorded messages and leaflets dropped from the sky, with instructions to leave areas about to be attacked. But this time she found herself talking to a real person. The man said Israel was about to start an operation nearby. For her safety, and that of her family, she needed to leave. “I wanted to curse him, but I couldn’t.” She says she was curious, after two-and-a-half months of war, to find herself speaking to an Israeli. She imagined what it must feel like to spend your whole day making the same phone call over and over. “I felt like there is on the other side an employee who’s sick of his work.” For all the horrifying immediacy of the war consuming the north, this was as close as Asmaa ever came to meeting an Israeli soldier. Part of her wishes that she’d had more contact. “I’m really curious about the way they’re fighting, how they look at us, how they understand the struggle,” she told me later. “I feel like I need to dive inside their minds.” At the end of December, as the bulk of the fighting moved south, the family made its weary way back to the house in Jabalia. “We started the new year in the best way ever - all together in our partially-destroyed home.” Asmaa’s father, a retired carpenter, spent the following weeks repairing the damage, fixing windows, doors and cupboards. But food was in desperately short supply. International aid agencies warned that famine was looming. Asmaa noticed that people in Jabalia were starting to look gaunt. Asmaa’s family had stocked up on canned goods. But flour, meat, fruit and vegetables had all disappeared from the markets. Aid agencies were struggling to bring humanitarian relief to the north. The family eked out their dwindling rations, ate twice a day, and drank tea without sugar - something practically unheard of among Palestinians. On the roof of the house, where her brother’s room had once stood, her father started growing vegetables. Asmaa had lost 9kg (almost 20lb) and felt her appetite ebbing away. But slowly, the humanitarian situation started to improve. Air drops and new aid routes into the north kept famine at bay. Flour was back. The family had chicken and tomatoes for the first time in months. There was more water, too. Enough for the occasional shower. “We started to feel a little bit settled down.” But then the war came back. On 12 May, the Israeli army returned to Jabalia, saying intelligence indicated Hamas was once more operating out of the area. Asmaa was bewildered. “Only days ago, they were talking about a very possible ceasefire,” she wrote, “and suddenly I woke to ‘Let’s pack, we have to leave asap.’” The family went west, to an area known as al-Nasr, near the coast, where her grandparents had lived before the war. Al-Nasr was a wasteland, much of it reduced to rubble months earlier. But her grandparents’ house was intact. Long-since looted following their departure for the south, but somehow undamaged. The family moved in and settled down, wondering how long this third dislocation would last. One day, driven by curiosity, Asmaa walked to the nearby beach, where she marvelled at the sight of Gazans frolicking in the waves, despite the ominous presence of Israeli gunboats patrolling offshore. “We’ve started to feel careless,” she told me. “We don’t care for our lives any more. That’s how tired we are.” On 19 May came the news that Asmaa had long dreaded. Her grandfather had died the day before, aged 91. After being forced to move repeatedly, he and his wife had recently settled in a tent in al-Mawasi, a desperately overcrowded place of dismal conditions, where many Palestinians had fled after the Israeli army began an operation in Rafah at the start of the month. Sheltering in his abandoned house, Asmaa felt bereft. She hadn’t seen her grandfather since just before the war, when she had persuaded him to pose for a selfie. “I was so happy that I managed to take that memory.” Israeli forces finally left Jabalia on 1 June. Four days later, the family trudged back through streets so ravaged they were barely recognisable, to find their home still standing but increasingly battle-scarred. The whole process - of cleaning, repairing and planting - had to start again, made harder this time by the fact that a missile had destroyed the workshop where her father kept all his tools. For months, Asmaa and I had only ever communicated by text. Finally, in early July, we spoke on the phone. Two long conversations in which Asmaa took me through her Gazan odyssey and described how it had changed her. Each time, her voice faded in and out and the line crackled, creating the impression of enormous distance. Each time, Israeli drones, ubiquitous since this war began, could be heard buzzing in the background. Asmaa said survival was a mixed blessing. Everyone in the house was alive. But the war wasn’t over and the threat of death was constant. “I feel anxious all the time, thinking that there will be one day in which I will lose something,” she said. “I mean, our turn will come.” Gaza, where Asmaa had nurtured her dreams, had been devastated. But it wasn’t the physical changes that were absorbing her the most. Society, she said, had been utterly transformed. The constant shocks of death, displacement and trauma leaving whole neighbourhoods teetering on the brink of disintegration. Tight-knit communities had been blown apart, she said, with family members and neighbours scattered up and down the length of the Gaza Strip, and beyond. Sometimes, in the struggle for survival, Gazans had turned on themselves. A total breakdown in law and order leaving gangs and rival families to battle it out for control of precious resources. “It’s becoming really normal to see people even killing each other,” Asmaa said. But if war had brought out the worst in people, it had also brought out the best. In Jabalia, Asmaa said, people were sharing food and water, exchanging the latest news and information on where to charge mobile phones. With basic foodstuffs once again in short supply, women were swapping improvised recipes. “Everyone is really taking care of each other.” Asmaa said it would take decades for Gazans to recover the meagre, confined, life they knew before 7 October. Defiant talk of reconstruction and renewal, she said, felt delusional. As for herself, Asmaa’s only dream now was to escape. “I don’t have any hope in this place,” she told me. “I’m not the same person any more. I don’t think I’ll recover.” Pentagon announces Middle East reinforcements as Iran says it will ""punish"" Israel for assassination of Hamas leader.

2,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-03 05:36:43.000,Overwhelming evidence Venezuela opposition won election - Blinken,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd1d10453zno,2024-08-03 03:44:25.000,"The US secretary of state has said there was ""overwhelming evidence"" Venezuela's opposition won the recent presidential election. In a statement Antony Blinken said it was clear Edmundo González, had won the most votes - despite incumbent president Nicolás Maduro declaring a disputed victory. ""Given the overwhelming evidence, it is clear to the United States and, most importantly, to the Venezuelan people that Edmundo González Urrutia won the most votes in Venezuela's 28 July presidential election,"" Mr Blinken said. His intervention comes as the presidents of Brazil, Mexico and Colombia all called on Venezuela to release the full details of last Sunday's election. The US State Department later said Mr Blinken had spoken to Mr González to congratulate him ""for receiving the most votes"". In a call with Mr González and the opposition party's leader María Corina Machado, Mr Blinken ""expressed his concern for their safety and well-being"" and ""condemned all political violence and repression"". On Friday, Venezuela's election authority ratified Mr Maduro's disputed victory - saying he had won about 52% of votes to Mr González's 43%, from 97% of votes counted. Mr Maduro accused the opposition of producing fake evidence to contest the result of the election and said the US was behind what he described as a farce and a coup attempt. In a media conference, he also blamed the opposition for spreading false information and encouraging violence in Venezuela. Last Sunday, the electoral council, which is government-controlled, announced President Maduro had won the election for a third term. But this was immediately disputed by the opposition who said, with access to the majority of receipts from electronic voting machines around the country, it was false. The opposition has said its own vote tally shows it won the election by a wide margin. Opinion polls ahead of the election had suggested a clear victory for the challenger. The announcement of Mr Maduro’s victory on Sunday set off deadly protests in Caracas. It has also attracted global criticism, with many governments around the world demanding the Venezuelan government release proof of the result. The result has been recognised by Venezuelan allies China, Russia and Iran. But, the US, European Union and other G7 countries have called on Mr Maduro’s government to release detailed voting data. Posting on social media, Mr Blinken said: ""Electoral data overwhelmingly demonstrate the will of the Venezuelan people: democratic opposition candidate Edmundo González won the most votes in Sunday’s election. ""Venezuelans have voted, and their votes must count."" The intervention by Mr Blinken is significant. After the last election in 2018 was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair, countries including the US decided to recognise the then-opposition leader Juan Guaido as interim president and imposed sanctions on Venezuela. Mr Blinken said it was ""time for the Venezuelan parties to begin discussions on a respectful, peaceful transition in accordance with Venezuelan electoral law and the wishes of the Venezuelan people"". Argentine Foreign Minister Diana Mondino shared Mr Blinken's view, writing in a post on X, formerly Twitter: ""We can all confirm, without a doubt, that the legitimate winner and President-elect is Edmundo González."" Ecuador, Uruguay, Costa Rica and Peru have also recognised Mr González as the president-elect. However, the governments of Brazil, Colombia and Mexico called for an ""impartial verification"" of the result, urging Venezuela to publish voting data broken down by polling stations in a joint statement. Opposition leader Ms Machado, who says she is in hiding, has called for mass demonstrations on Saturday. Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, she said Mr Maduro did not win the election. She claimed her party's candidate, Mr Gonzalez, won by a landslide and Ms Machado said she could prove this because she had receipts from more than 80% of polling stations. Ms Machado appealed for help, saying it was now up to the international community to decide whether to tolerate what she called an illegitimate government. Hundreds of demonstrators have been detained following Venezuela's disputed presidential election. Under pressure to back up claims he won the election, President Maduro turns to the country's top court. The Carter Center says the presidential election ""cannot be considered democratic"". Jordan Goudreau, 48, allegedly sent weapons, ammunition and other gear without a US export licence. The opposition says it has proof President Maduro's victory claim is fraudulent; his defence minster has warned of a ""coup"". Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

2,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-03 05:36:43.000,"Kim Jong Un wants Trump back, elite defector tells BBC",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jqjwdyl1ko,2024-08-02 08:02:17.000,"Donald Trump returning to the White House would be “a once-in-a-thousand-year opportunity” for North Korea, according to a man in a unique position to know. Ri Il Kyu is the highest-ranking defector to escape North Korea since 2016 and has been face to face with Kim Jong Un on seven separate occasions. The former diplomat, who was working in Cuba when he fled with his family to South Korea last November, admits to ""shivering with nerves"" the first time he met Kim Jong Un. But during each meeting, he found the leader to be “smiling and in a good mood”. “He praised people often and laughed. He seems like an ordinary person,” Mr Ri tells the BBC. But he is in no doubt Mr Kim would do anything to guarantee his survival, even if it meant killing all 25 million of his people: “He could have been a wonderful person and father, but turning him into a god has made him a monstrous being.” In his first interview with an international broadcaster, Mr Ri provides a rare understanding of what one of the world’s most secretive and repressive states is hoping to achieve. He says that North Korea still views Mr Trump as someone it can negotiate with over its nuclear weapons programme, despite talks between him and Kim Jong Un breaking down in 2019. Mr Trump has previously hailed the relationship with Kim as a key achievement of his presidency. He famously said the two “fell in love” exchanging letters. Just last month, he told a rally Mr Kim would like to see him back in office: “I think he misses me, if you want to know the truth.” North Korea is hoping it can use this close personal relationship to its advantage, says Mr Ri, contradicting an official statement from Pyongyang last month that it “did not care” who became president. The nuclear state will never get rid of its weapons, Mr Ri says, and would probably seek a deal to freeze its nuclear programme in return for the US lifting sanctions. But he says Pyongyang would not negotiate in good faith. Agreeing to freeze its nuclear programme “would be a ploy, 100% deception”, he says, adding that this was therefore a “dangerous approach” which would “only lead to the strengthening of North Korea”. Eight months after his defection, Ri Il Kyu is living with his family in South Korea. Accompanied by a police bodyguard and two intelligence agents, he explains his decision to abandon his government. After years of being ground down by the corruption, bribery and lack of freedom he faced, Mr Ri says he was finally tipped over the edge when his request to travel to Mexico to get an operation on a slipped disc in his neck was denied. “I lived the life of the top 1% in North Korea, but that is still worse than a middle-class family in the South."" As a diplomat in Cuba, Mr Ri made just $500 (£294) a month and so would sell Cuban cigars illegally in China to make enough to support his family. When he first told his wife about his desire to defect, she was so disturbed she ended up in hospital with heart problems. After that, he kept his plans secret, only sharing them with her and his child six hours before their plane was due to depart. He describes it as a “life-or-death gamble”. Regular North Koreans who are caught defecting would typically be tortured for a few months, then released, he says. “But for elites like us, there are only two outcomes - life in a political prison camp or being executed by a firing squad."" “The fear and terror were overwhelming. I could accept my own death, but I could not bear the thought of my family being dragged to a gulag,” he says. Although Mr Ri had never believed in God, as he waited nervously at the airport gate in the middle of the night, he began to pray. The last known high-profile defection to the South was that of Tae Yong-ho in 2016. A former deputy ambassador to the UK, he was recently named the new leader of South Korea's presidential advisory council on unification. Turning to North Korea’s recent closer ties with Russia, Mr Ri says the Ukraine war had been a stroke of luck for Pyongyang. The US and South Korea estimate the North has sold Moscow millions of rounds of ammunition to support its invasion, in return for food, fuel and possibly even military technology. Mr Ri says the main benefit of this deal for Pyongyang was the ability to continue developing its nuclear weapons. With the deal, Russia created a ""loophole"" in the stringent international sanctions on North Korea, he says, which has allowed it “to freely develop its nuclear weapons and missiles and strengthen its defence, while bypassing the need to appeal to the US for sanctions relief”. But Mr Ri says Kim Jong Un understands this relationship is temporary and that after the war, Russia is likely to sever relations. For this reason, Mr Kim has not given up on the US, Mr Ri says. “North Korea understands that the only path to its survival, the only way to eliminate the threat of invasion and develop its economy, is to normalise relations with the United States."" While Russia might have given North Korea a temporary respite from its economic pain, Mr Ri says the complete closure of North Korea’s borders during the pandemic “severely devastated the country’s economy and people’s lives”. When the borders reopened in 2023 and diplomats were preparing to return, Mr Ri says families back home had asked them to “bring anything and everything you have, even your used toothbrushes, because there is nothing left in North Korea”. The North Korean leader demands total loyalty from his citizens and the mere whiff of dissent can result in imprisonment. But Mr Ri says years of hardship had eroded people’s loyalty, as no-one now expected to receive anything from their “Supreme Leader” Kim Jong Un. “There is no genuine loyalty to the regime or to Kim Jong Un anymore, it is a forced loyalty, where one must be loyal or face death,” he says. Recent change has largely been driven by an influx of South Korean films, dramas and music, which have been smuggled into the North and are illegal to watch and listen to. “People don’t watch South Korean content because they have capitalist beliefs, they are simply trying to pass the time in their monotonous and bleak lives,” Mr Ri says, but then they begin to ask, “Why do those in the South live the life of a first-world country while we are impoverished?"" But Mr Ri says that although South Korean content was changing North Korea, it would not bring about its collapse, because of the systems of control in place. “Kim Jong Un is very aware that loyalty is waning, that people are evolving, and that’s why he is intensifying his reign of terror,” he says. The government has introduced laws to harshly punish those who consume and distribute South Korean content. The BBC spoke to one defector last year who said he had witnessed someone be executed after sharing South Korean music and TV shows. North Korea’s decision, at the end of last year, to abandon a decades-old policy of eventually reunifying with the South, was a further attempt to isolate people from the South, Mr Ri says. He describes this as Kim Jong Un’s “most evil act”, because all North Koreans dream of reunification. He says that while North Korea’s past leaders had “stolen people’s freedom, money and human rights, Kim Jong Un has robbed what was left of them: hope”. Outside North Korea, much attention is paid to Kim Jong Un’s health, with some believing that his premature death could trigger the collapse of the regime. Earlier this week, South Korea’s intelligence agency estimated that Mr Kim weighed 140kg, putting him at risk of cardiovascular disease. But Mr Ri believes the system of surveillance and control is now too well established for Kim’s death to threaten the dictatorship. “Another evil leader will merely take his place,” he says. It has been widely speculated that Mr Kim is grooming his young daughter, thought to be called Ju Ae, to be his successor, but Mr Ri dismisses the notion. Ju Ae, he says, lacks the legitimacy and popularity to become the leader of North Korea, especially as the sacred Paektu bloodline, which the Kims use to justify their rule, is believed to run only through the men of the family. At first, people were fascinated by Ju Ae, Mr Ri says, but not any more. They question why she was attending missile tests rather than going to school, and wearing luxury, designer clothes instead of her school uniform, like other children. Rather than waiting for Mr Kim to become ill or die, Mr Ri says the international community has to come together, including North Korea’s allies China and Russia, to “persistently persuade it to change”. “This is the only thing that will bring about the end of the North Korean dictatorship,"" he adds. Mr Ri is hoping that his defection inspires his peers, not to defect themselves, but to push for small changes from the inside. He does not have lofty ambitions, that North Koreans will be able to vote or travel, merely that they can choose what jobs to work, have enough food to eat and be able to share their opinions freely among friends. For now, though, his priority is helping his family settle into their new life in South Korea and for his child to assimilate into society.

2,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-03 05:36:43.000,Justin Timberlake licence suspended in drink-driving case,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g0gzprryzo,2024-08-02 15:45:26.000,"Justin Timberlake had his driving licence suspended in the state of New York, as he pleaded not guilty to a charge of driving while intoxicated. The pop star was arrested 18 June for going through a stop sign and failing to stay on the right side of the road. Timberlake, 43, appeared virtually from Europe where he is on tour as he was formally charged with the crime in Sag Harbor, New York. Sag Harbor Village Justice Justice Carl Irace suspended Timberlake's driving licence for an undetermined period, as is standard after a DWI arrest. Timberlake's lawyer has denied he was under the influence at the wheel and says the charges should be dismissed. On Friday, Timberlake wore a black-collared shirt and spoke twice during the virtual court hearing, answering ""yes"" to questions from the judge. He was appearing from Germany, where he is preparing to perform in Antwerp, Belgium, this weekend. The 10-time Grammy winner missed his first court hearing last week because of his world tour, called Everything I Thought It Was. The court had to hold another hearing because of a paperwork issue to formally charge him with the crime. The actor and pop star was stopped shortly after midnight in Sag Harbor in the Hamptons, a popular summer destination for celebrities on Long Island. When officers pulled him over, Timberlake's eyes were ""bloodshot and glassy"" and a ""strong odour of an alcoholic beverage was emanating from his breath"", according to a charging document. He refused a breathalyser test and performed poorly on sobriety tests, the police said. ""I had one martini and I followed my friends home,"" Timberlake allegedly told the officer who stopped him. During Friday's hearing, Judge Irace reportedly criticised the defence lawyer, Edward Burke, for making ""irresponsible"" comments to journalists outside court. He said he would impose a gag order on the attorney if he continued to make such remarks, NBC reported. ""It comes off as an attempt to poison the case before it even begins,"" Judge Irace was quoted as saying. Mr Burke told reporters last week that police had made ""a number of very significant errors"". “The most important fact to know about this case is that Justin was not intoxicated and should not have been arrested for DWI,” he said. In New York, penalties for charges related to driving while intoxicated include up to a year in jail, a $1,000 (£786) fine and the suspension of a driver’s licence for at least six months. Timberlake - who has been open about struggles with excessive drinking in the past - referred to the arrest days afterwards at a performance in Chicago. ""It's been a tough week,"" the Cry Me A River singer told the crowd. US defence secretary Lloyd Austin says he did not agree to deal and relieves officer overseeing court of authority. Pentagon announces Middle East reinforcements as Iran says it will ""punish"" Israel for assassination of Hamas leader.

2,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-03 05:36:43.000,Idris Elba's studio plan sparks dreams of 'Zollywood',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8808gyxr8jo,2024-08-02 17:20:35.000,"Hollywood star Idris Elba has been allocated land in Zanzibar, a Tanzanian archipelago, to launch a film studio. The British actor, who has roots in Sierra Leone and Ghana, has previously voiced his ambitions to develop Africa's expanding film industry. Roughly a year-and-a-half after discussing his plans with Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan, the authorities in the East African nation have given Elba the green light. The studio would be similar to any in “Hollywood, Nollywood or Bollywood"" - and may give rise to “Zollywood”, Zanzibar's investment minister is quoted by local media as saying. ""I'm not sure how we will call it in Zanzibar, whether Zollywood or Zawood,"" Shariff Ali Shariff joked as he addressed industry figures at the Zanzibar International Film Festival on Thursday. President Samia spoke with Elba, best known for his roles in Luther and the Wire, about the studio in January 2023 at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. Following the discussions, the president's spokesperson said ""if successful, the project will help not only Tanzania but also eastern and central Africa"". Zanzibar - a semi-autonomous region off the coast of Tanzania - is a tourism hotspot known for its striking white beaches. Last year, the 51-year-old Golden Globes winner also spoke of his plans to build a film studio in Ghana. ""Currently, we call it West African Studios, but that's a working title. We've been working on this for three or four years to raise a plan that puts a facility at the centre of African filmmaking,"" the actor told Ghanaian media in February 2023. He recognised the talent in Africa's film industry, but said the facilities were ""lacking"". A 2022 report from Unesco backs Elba's statement. The UN's cultural agency said that despite ""significant growth in production"", industries across the content were hindered by issues such as piracy, insubstantial training opportunities and a lack of official film institutions. Elba not only hopes to strengthen Africa's film ecosystem, he also has dreams of building an eco-friendly ""smart city"" in his father's birthplace, Sierra Leone. Elba and his childhood friend are planning to regenerate an island off the West African country's coast. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

2,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-03 05:36:43.000,Al Jazeera rebuffs Israeli claim killed journalist was Hamas operative,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1rwr8lj9jro,2024-08-02 16:35:45.000,"Al Jazeera has strongly rejected the Israeli military’s claim that its correspondent killed in an air strike in Gaza this week was a Hamas operative who participated in the 7 October attacks. Harrowing video shared on social media showed Ismail al-Ghoul’s decapitated body after he was targeted in his car in Gaza City on Wednesday. His cameraman, Rami al-Rifi, and a boy passing on a bicycle, Khalid Shawa, were also killed. While regional news this week has been dominated by other high-profile assassinations, many Palestinians have also focused on the killing of the locally prominent journalist. In a statement on Thursday, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) described Ismail al-Ghoul as a “Hamas military wing operative and Nukhba terrorist” - the assertion being he was part of an elite unit in the armed group. It alleged that as part of his role he “instructed other operatives on how to record operations and was actively involved in recording and publicising attacks against IDF troops”. The IDF did not include Rami al-Rifi in its statement. Al Jazeera called the accusation against its staff member “baseless” and said it “highlights Israel’s long history of fabrications and false evidence used to cover up its heinous crimes”. Ismail's brother Jihad also told the BBC that his late sibling was strictly a civilian “portraying the suffering of the Palestinian people inside Gaza City to the outside world”. Based in Gaza City, the reporter had become a regular face on the Qatar-based TV channel, which is a popular news source in the region but has faced intense criticism from Israeli authorities. As Friday prayers in Gaza were dedicated to the late Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated in the Iranian capital Tehran, some Palestinians said they were also thinking about those who had been killed closer to home. “I am truly heartbroken about Ismail [al-Ghoul],” commented Maha Sarsak, who has been displaced from Shujaiyeh to the centre of the strip. “I was keeping up on the news in the north through him on social media. We didn’t always have a TV, but we could hear his voice on the radio.” Journalists in Gaza laid down their flak jackets at one gathering to honour al-Ghoul and al-Rifi this week. A friend of the pair said: “They hadn’t been sleeping for days nor eating. They had even lost a lot of weight.” Ismail al-Ghoul covered Israel’s raid of Shifa Hospital in March and was arrested by the IDF at the site - but released after 12 hours without charge. Al Jazeera claimed this “debunks and refutes their false claim of his affiliation with any organisation”. The two Al Jazeera journalists’ last assignment had been gathering reaction to news of Haniyeh’s death. Their car was targeted close to the Hamas leader’s destroyed house in Shati Camp, an urban refugee camp. Israel has blocked international journalists from entering the Palestinian territory during the war, except on limited and highly controlled visits with the Israeli military. Prior to the closure of its Rafah border crossing with Gaza, Egypt also prevented reporters from entering. Over 10 months, many networks, including the BBC, have relied on local Palestinian staff for their on-the-ground news coverage and taken on new employees or freelancers. Al Jazeera said that Ismail al-Ghoul had been working for the channel since November. It said that he had endured “hardships” during the war including losing his father and brother. Other cameramen spoke of how al-Rifi had used his technical expertise to help them with their filming. After images of a dead Khaled al-Shawa, the boy killed in the strike, were widely publicised, the boy’s mother put out a message on social media pleading for him to be remembered too. “My son is not an unidentified martyr,” she said. “We must say the names of our martyrs. They should not talk about us as numbers.” Al Jazeera, which broadcasts in English and Arabic, has recently seen a series of attacks against its staff in Gaza and their families. In late October, Wael Dahdouh, the network’s well-known bureau chief, was reporting when he received word on-air that his wife, daughter, a son, and grandchild were killed in an Israeli airstrike. In December, he was injured in an attack that also killed another Al Jazeera cameraman, Samer Abudaqa. In January, a strike killed Mr Dahdouh’s son, Hamza, and Mustafa Thuria, a video stringer, while they were working for Al Jazeera. The IDF later alleged the men were “members of Gaza-based terrorist organizations"". Al Jazeera has previously fiercely denied Israel’s claims and accused it of systematically targeting its employees. The network has also condemned the decision by Israel’s government in May to ban its broadcast in the country on accusations it harms national security. Last month, the ban was extended by the Tel Aviv District Court. The United Nations has called for a full investigation and accountability for the killings of the Al Jazeera journalists and others, saying that journalists everywhere must be protected. There are differing tallies of the number of media workers killed since the unprecedented, deadly Hamas-led attacks on Israel that prompted the war in Gaza. However, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, the latest deaths in Gaza bring the number of journalists killed to 113, including 108 Palestinians, three Lebanese and two Israelis who were killed during the 7 October assault.

2,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-03 05:36:43.000,Nigerians hit with 24-hour curfews amid protests,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxr2r5qrn52o,2024-08-02 14:30:56.000,"Millions of residents in northern Nigeria have been placed under 24-hour curfews amid nationwide protests against the high cost of living. Governments in the states of Kano, Jigawa, Yobe and Katsina have ordered locals not to leave their homes - and therefore not attend protests - on Friday. The authorities say the curfew is necessary because ""hoodlums"" have hijacked the protests in order to loot and vandalise properties. There is a heavy security presence around the country with nine more ""days of rage"" scheduled by the movement's organisers. On the first day, demonstrations in the northern city of Kano drew the largest crowds. Police fired live bullets and tear gas - and sprayed hot water - to try and disperse thousands of demonstrators. Three people were shot dead and many others were injured. Looters also broke into a warehouse near the Kano governor's house and police say 269 people have since been arrested with the recovery of many 25-litre groundnut oil cartons and other items taken. According to rights group Amnesty International, 13 protesters across Nigeria were killed by security forces on the first day of the protests. On Thursday night, Nigeria's police chief Kayode Egbetokun said four people in the north-eastern state of Borno had been killed by an ""explosion"" within a crowd of protesters. Thirty-four others were ""severely"" injured, he said. A curfew was announced there after anti-government protesters began marching in the state capital, Maiduguri, although the authorities cited an earlier explosion as the reason why Borno had joined its neighbouring states in imposing a 24-hour lockdown. The blast on Wednesday night had killed 16 people at a teashop in the rural community of Kawori, according to local reports. No-one has said they were behind the attack, but locals suspect it was carried out by notorious jihadist group Boko Haram, which has been active in the north-east since 2009. On Friday, protesters regrouped in major cities across the country. In the capital city, Abuja, police fired tear gas in an effort to stop protesters marching on the city centre and other satellite towns. In Lagos, Nigeria's biggest city, some banks and shops reopened after closing on the first day of the protests - and the internet connection remains glitchy. Inspector-General Egbetokun said he had placed his officers on ""red alert"". The police are prepared to respond swiftly to any threats to public safety and order, he added. The nationwide demonstrations were organised via social media using the hashtag #EndBadGovernance and inspired by the recent success of protesters in Kenya, who forced the government there to scrap plans to increase taxes. During Thursday's protests, which were largely peaceful in the south, demonstrators chanted slogans such as: “We are hungry.” Many of them are angered by President Bola Tinubu’s removal of a subsidy on fuel - announced with immediate effect during his inauguration speech in May 2023. It was aimed at cutting government expenditure, but sent pump prices soaring with a ripple effect on other goods, such as food. Protesters also want the government to carry out wide-ranging reforms to the country’s electoral system and the judiciary. A spokesperson for Kano's governor, Abba Kabir Yusuf, said protests there were largely peaceful but a curfew was necessary because of the ""rampant looting, destruction of property and violence"" unleashed by ""thugs"". Likewise, Yobe State Government imposed a curfew on the areas of Potiskum, Gashua, and Nguru, where it says ""hoodlums are taking advantage of the protest to vandalise and loot government and private properties"". Katsina's government said ""miscreants"" had ""hijacked the protests"" there. Additional reporting by the BBC's Azeezat Olaoluwa Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

2,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-03 05:36:43.000,Overwhelming evidence Venezuela opposition won election - Blinken,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd1d10453zno,2024-08-03 03:44:25.000,"The US secretary of state has said there was ""overwhelming evidence"" Venezuela's opposition won the recent presidential election. In a statement Antony Blinken said it was clear Edmundo González, had won the most votes - despite incumbent president Nicolás Maduro declaring a disputed victory. ""Given the overwhelming evidence, it is clear to the United States and, most importantly, to the Venezuelan people that Edmundo González Urrutia won the most votes in Venezuela's 28 July presidential election,"" Mr Blinken said. His intervention comes as the presidents of Brazil, Mexico and Colombia all called on Venezuela to release the full details of last Sunday's election. The US State Department later said Mr Blinken had spoken to Mr González to congratulate him ""for receiving the most votes"". In a call with Mr González and the opposition party's leader María Corina Machado, Mr Blinken ""expressed his concern for their safety and well-being"" and ""condemned all political violence and repression"". On Friday, Venezuela's election authority ratified Mr Maduro's disputed victory - saying he had won about 52% of votes to Mr González's 43%, from 97% of votes counted. Mr Maduro accused the opposition of producing fake evidence to contest the result of the election and said the US was behind what he described as a farce and a coup attempt. In a media conference, he also blamed the opposition for spreading false information and encouraging violence in Venezuela. Last Sunday, the electoral council, which is government-controlled, announced President Maduro had won the election for a third term. But this was immediately disputed by the opposition who said, with access to the majority of receipts from electronic voting machines around the country, it was false. The opposition has said its own vote tally shows it won the election by a wide margin. Opinion polls ahead of the election had suggested a clear victory for the challenger. The announcement of Mr Maduro’s victory on Sunday set off deadly protests in Caracas. It has also attracted global criticism, with many governments around the world demanding the Venezuelan government release proof of the result. The result has been recognised by Venezuelan allies China, Russia and Iran. But, the US, European Union and other G7 countries have called on Mr Maduro’s government to release detailed voting data. Posting on social media, Mr Blinken said: ""Electoral data overwhelmingly demonstrate the will of the Venezuelan people: democratic opposition candidate Edmundo González won the most votes in Sunday’s election. ""Venezuelans have voted, and their votes must count."" The intervention by Mr Blinken is significant. After the last election in 2018 was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair, countries including the US decided to recognise the then-opposition leader Juan Guaido as interim president and imposed sanctions on Venezuela. Mr Blinken said it was ""time for the Venezuelan parties to begin discussions on a respectful, peaceful transition in accordance with Venezuelan electoral law and the wishes of the Venezuelan people"". Argentine Foreign Minister Diana Mondino shared Mr Blinken's view, writing in a post on X, formerly Twitter: ""We can all confirm, without a doubt, that the legitimate winner and President-elect is Edmundo González."" Ecuador, Uruguay, Costa Rica and Peru have also recognised Mr González as the president-elect. However, the governments of Brazil, Colombia and Mexico called for an ""impartial verification"" of the result, urging Venezuela to publish voting data broken down by polling stations in a joint statement. Opposition leader Ms Machado, who says she is in hiding, has called for mass demonstrations on Saturday. Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, she said Mr Maduro did not win the election. She claimed her party's candidate, Mr Gonzalez, won by a landslide and Ms Machado said she could prove this because she had receipts from more than 80% of polling stations. Ms Machado appealed for help, saying it was now up to the international community to decide whether to tolerate what she called an illegitimate government. Hundreds of demonstrators have been detained following Venezuela's disputed presidential election. Under pressure to back up claims he won the election, President Maduro turns to the country's top court. The Carter Center says the presidential election ""cannot be considered democratic"". Jordan Goudreau, 48, allegedly sent weapons, ammunition and other gear without a US export licence. The opposition says it has proof President Maduro's victory claim is fraudulent; his defence minster has warned of a ""coup"". Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

2,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-03 05:36:43.000,Beauty contest sparks row over who counts as South African,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn38ppr4zj0o,2024-08-03 00:10:47.000,"When law student Chidimma Adetshina clinched a coveted spot as a Miss South Africa finalist, her triumph unleashed a vicious backlash, unearthing a seam of xenophobia that lies close to the surface for some in the country. The 23-year-old’s name hints at her connection to Nigeria, but internet detectives wanted to know more and combed through every inch of her life. They found that her father is Nigerian and though her mother is South African, her family had come from neighbouring Mozambique. ""On behalf of South Africans, we don’t recognise her and that name! She better start packing and go home,” raged one commenter on X. But where is home? Ms Adetshina is South African, as verified by the organisers of the pageant. She has said in interviews that she was born in Soweto - the township next to Johannesburg - and grew up in Cape Town. However, the “go-home” sentiment, and even harsher attacks, flooded social media. There was also a petition demanding her removal from the high-profile televised competition that amassed more than 14,000 signatures before it was taken down. The country’s Culture Minister Gayton McKenzie, the leader of the Patriotic Alliance party, which has joined a coalition government and made migration issues a key part of its platform, chimed in. “We truly cannot have Nigerians compete in our Miss SA competition. I wanna get all facts before I comment but it gives funny vibes already,"" he said on X. The issue has touched a nerve in South Africa that goes beyond who will appear on stage at the final next weekend. Ms Adetshina declined a BBC request for an interview but she did tell the Sowetan Live news site that the online hate she was facing made her think twice about competing. ""I am representing a country, but I don’t feel the love from the people I’m representing,"" she said. Ms Adetshina added that the whole situation felt like ""black-on-black hate"", highlighting a particular strain of xenophobia in South Africa known as ""afrophobia"", which targets other Africans. She felt that she was not the only contestant among the last 16 women with a name that had origins from beyond the country’s shores - there are some with South Asian and European names - yet she was receiving the bulk of the criticism. Asked to respond to the comments that Ms Adetshina has faced, a Miss South Africa spokesperson did not address them directly but simply said that she was eligible to take part in the competition. This was not the first time that this has happened. For Melissa Nayimuli, a Miss South Africa contestant last year, it has brought up difficult memories. The 28-year-old was the target of the same vitriol heaped on Ms Adetshina because her father is Ugandan. She told the BBC she was unsurprised at the reaction she had received as she had experienced it for most of her life. “It’s something I tried to run away from, but how do you run away from yourself?” she questioned. Ms Nayimuli said that while growing up she would constantly speak Xhosa, her mother tongue and one of South Africa’s official languages, to “prove her South African-ness”. Her voice cracked as she admitted that she felt shame at her Ugandan identity when she was younger because of the afrophobia that she experienced. ""I would not want to be seen with my father because of his darker skin and East African features were a dead giveaway,"" she told the BBC. ""At home my father was my hero, but outside I saw him treated as an enemy."" University of the Free State sociologist Dr Nombulelo Shange links this hostility to South Africa's history of racism and the apartheid system - which imposed a strict hierarchy that privileged white people. There is a ""sad apartheid mentality that we are struggling to shake as a country"", she said. ""It shows the deep self-hate that we as black South Africans carry with us."" Dr Shange added that South Africans had internalised oppressive racist reasoning such as colourism, where lighter skin tones are perceived as better. After apartheid ended in 1994, the government led by Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC) welcomed African migrants and asylum seekers to the country in part to aid its reintegration into the continent after years of isolation. But with many South Africans struggling financially, foreigners became the target for some frustrated by their situation. Zimbabweans, Nigerians and Somalis, among others, have been accused of taking opportunities and resources from South Africans. There is a “perception of outsiders as competitors for scarce jobs, resources, living space and services”, Michael Morris, head of media at the South African Institute of Race Relations, told the BBC. He said the growing number of Africans succeeding in South Africa could “easily trigger resentment and violence”. This climate of hostility has occasionally erupted into attacks. South Africa experienced its worst outbreak of violence against mostly African foreigners in 2008, when more than 60 people died. “There are black South Africans who will argue that Africans from elsewhere in the continent don’t belong in South Africa,"" Mr Morris said. More than a decade ago, Ms Nayimuli felt this animosity acutely when her father was arrested. ""My dad is the most kind-hearted, gentle soul in the entire universe,"" she said - yet he was treated like a criminal because, she believes, he looked like a foreigner. When Ms Nayimuli’s mother reached the police station in the capital, Pretoria, where her husband was being held officers did not even have an explanation or a charge against him. Her father was released and Ms Nayimuli’s family never spoke about it again. They had often ""tiptoed"" around the xenophobia they faced but when it bubbled up during last year’s Miss South Africa it was a chance for them to address the issue directly and was, for Ms Nayimuli, part of a healing process. Now, seeing Ms Adetshina experience the same level of abuse her heart goes out to her. ""She is not just a trending topic. She is a human being. She is a young woman getting bullied online - it's wrong, hurtful and so dangerous,"" she said. But she emphasised that the xenophobes are a small minority and there are many South Africans who call for unity. Leader of the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party Julius Malema defended Ms Adetshina last week, saying: “Why do people want to say she’s from Nigeria or Mozambique? She was born here.” This message of coming together is one that Ms Nayimuli ended her Miss South Africa journey on. Last year, as the bright lights shone on her during the final round of the competition, she called for African unity in the face of hate. “Let’s step into our power as Africa. We are one,” she said to a raucous auditorium who cheered on her message of togetherness. But it seems it did not take root as the discrimination has resurfaced. Next Saturday, Ms Adetshina will get her chance to take to the stage, but it is not yet clear if she will tackle the haters head on. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

2,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-03 05:36:43.000,A bear mauled a Romanian teen to death. Will a cull solve the problem?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8vd26m4r86o,2024-08-03 00:01:39.000,"On 9 July, Diana Cazacu, a 19-year-old hiker, was mauled to death by a young female bear in the Bucegi mountains north of Bucharest. In response, the government overturned a 2016 moratorium on bear hunting - and reignited a fierce debate about what to do with Romania's growing bear population, the largest in Europe outside Russia. The staff at the Salvamont headquarters, Romania’s mountain rescue service, radiate calm and efficiency. When Diana and her boyfriend rang the emergency number, 112, in panic at 15:00 on 9 July, the call was transferred here. Sergiu Frusinoiu, in charge that day, set out immediately with two teams. One approached the incident spot from above, the other from below. Bears rarely attack humans, except in self-defence - so Sergiu assumed this would be a simple rescue mission. At the scene they found the woman’s distraught boyfriend. The bear had grabbed Diana, and thrown her down the ravine. They descended by rope, and found the bear standing over the victim. The bear attacked the rescue team, who defended themselves with pepper spray, firecrackers and rocks, until a hunter arrived and shot the bear. It was too late for Diana, lying on her stomach, her head in the stream. “Even if the fall or her injuries didn’t kill her, the water could have,” Sergiu told me. He said Diana's mistake had been to run away when faced with the bear. Sergiu grew up in these mountains, and has had hundreds of encounters with bears, without incident, he said. The standard advice is to make noise in bear territory as you walk. If you encounter a bear, stand quiet and still, then back slowly away. As with a dog, the worst thing you can do is run away, as it is sure to follow. At the base of the footpath which Diana climbed that day, it becomes clear why the bear was on the path. Three large municipal waste bins, the remains of a cage around one, stand open to the sky. One has been tipped over, and there is rotting food, tins and plastic strewn over a wide area. Around 8,000 bears live in the arc of the Carpathian mountains, one of Europe’s last wilderness regions, their habitat constantly eroded by logging, the spread of towns, and tourism. In the nearby town of Busteni, at seven in the evening, I get a bear alert on my phone, and rush to the scene, a residential street. Angry locals say they’re afraid to walk home at night, because of the bears. The police arrive, and the locals harangue them for doing too little. “But what do you want us to do?” asks a young officer. “Keep us safe!” shouts one man. I get through to the hunter who shot the bear who killed Diana, but he says he will not speak until the inquest is over. Former Environment Minister Barna Tanczos is the author of the new law, passed by the Chamber of Deputies and approved by President Klaus Iohannis in July, that allows people to kill up to 500 bears over the next 18 months . “The bear population is increasing daily, monthly, yearly in Romania, so if we don’t do something we will have thousands, tens of thousands of bears, which is not good for humans, and not good for the bears,"" Mr Tanczos said. ""So we have to establish control, we need a balance in human - bear relations, and conflicts, and contacts.” According to Cristi Remus Papp, head of the large carnivore department of the Worldwide Fund for Nature, the new law will do nothing to improve the situation, and could make it worse. There is a growing number of “troublesome” bears, he admits, but there are no accurate statistics for how many bears there are overall. In any case, the number is not the point, he says: “We have to address the root causes of the conflicts, starting with the mass feeding of bears close to settlements, and along the roads in tourist areas.” Since the communist era, hunters' associations are obliged by law to feed the bears - a practice initially meant to make them easier to shoot, and keep them out of towns, but is now partly done for tour operators, who want to guarantee a sighting of bears to their clients. Social media feeds are full of video clips of tourists feeding bears from their cars. A future change in the law could be to fine those who do so. Other bear management methods have been tried with some success - like tranquillising and removing bears to wild areas of the mountains. But now that bears have got into the habit of raiding bins or begging for food, even conservationists say there may be no alternative to culling them. One example of good practice is the town of Baile Tusnad. “In 2021 we had 220 bear alerts. This year so far, only 3,” Zsolt Butyka, the mayor told me proudly. His municipality bought 14 neat, stainless steel bear-proof bins, cut down 50 fruit trees in the town, and ran regular bear awareness campaign for the public. A poster near the town hall reads: “If you feed a bear, you kill a bear.” The town is on a main migration route for bears, across the Olt river valley, but now they skirt round the edges. “They’ve learnt there’s nothing for them here,” the mayor tells me. On a sultry summer evening, Janos Szin, a tour operator who runs a number of bear hides in the Tusnad area, sends me the map coordinates where to wait. A forest ranger in a four-wheel drive picks me up. Once we’re installed behind a large glass window in a raised hide, he produces a sack and scatters maize. The bears arrive while he is still there - two females, one with three cubs. After a while, a large male ambles up, and the others scatter. He climbs onto the scales, disguised as a feeding trough, and we see his weight: 240 kg (37 stone). In a phone conversation, Mr Szin tells me the law is bad. The “wrong bears” will be killed - the large males, minding their business up in the mountains. These males help keep the population down, he says, because they kill the cubs, so they can mate with their mothers. This is a common practice among lions in the wild, but experts disagree about its prevalence among bears. Poachers, trying to steal bear cubs, are another problem, Mr Szin suggests. He’s afraid that hunters from all over the world will now flock to Romania - the only place where they can bag a bear pelt and a skull, to hang on their walls. The charity is scaling back services to cope with maximum capacity and critically low funds. Lancashire Wildlife Trust says there has been a ""massive"" decline in the number of hedgehogs.

Peggy is appearing alongside Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman in the latest Marvel superhero film, Deadpool & Wolverine. The five-year-old pugese – a pug and Chinese crested cross – was cast as ""Dogpool"" after finding fame last year when she was crowned the ugliest pooch in a national contest last year. Recalling the past 18 months, Peggy's owner Holly Middleton, from East Yorkshire, said: ""Not in my wildest dreams did I think anything like that would have ever happened."" ""When we submitted her picture [to the ugly dog competition], I didn't think it would get to the heights it did,"" she added. ""I didn't think that'd be as big a deal as it was."" Peggy will make a homecoming appearance at a cinema in Hull later. She is due to meet fans at Cineworld, Kingswood, at 10:30 BST. However, despite amassing ""a massive fan base"", Mrs Middleton said Peggy was not displaying any ""diva behaviour"" at home. On the contrary, the usually ""reserved and lazy"" pugese had gained ""a bit more confidence"" from the trainer who was tasked with looking after her during production of Deadpool & Wolverine. ""She's still just plain old Peg,"" said Mrs Middleton. The 37-year-old make-up artist said the family had missed Peggy when she was away filming. ""It was really, really strange not to have her here,"" her owner said. ""I've got two boys and they missed her terribly. ""We didn't tell them where she was. Everything had to be kept quiet. ""I'm glad she's back. We missed her."" Watching Peggy making her debut at a premiere in New York and being held on the red carpet by Hollywood A-listers was ""surreal"", Mrs Middleton said. ""I loved it. Peggy looked really comfortable the entire time, as probably most people would being cuddled by Ryan Reynolds. ""They seem to really, really love her and they're so gentle with her, and you can see... they're giving her kisses and giving her little rubs on her head. ""I just loved every second of it. I loved seeing her up there doing her thing. ""She just looked so chilled and so happy."" Mrs Middleton said there were no plans at present for future film roles and Peggy was content with chilling at home. ""First and foremost, she is a family pet,"" she added. ""There's nothing she likes more than either cuddling with us on the couch, or snuggling in her bed."" Despite Peggy's global recognition, Mrs Middleton said she was ""the same as every other dog that gets walked in the village"" – though she ""absolutely loves"" attention and had become accustomed to turning people's heads. ""When I read comments online, they're all very positive and very much in favour of Peggy, saying how beautiful she is. ""Before all of this, just the way she looks she would get attention, but it was usually people sort of nudging each other and whispering, 'Oh, what's wrong with that dog'. ""So since everything's happened, the public perception of Peggy, and whether she's beautiful, ugly, or whatever has definitely changed for the better.""

2,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-03 05:36:43.000,Who are the US citizens still being held abroad? ,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98q8y1gl4xo,2024-08-02 18:09:05.000,"Reporter Evan Gershkovich, former US Marine Paul Wheelan and journalist Alsu Kurmasheva are in the US now, freed from captivity in Russia as part of a historic prisoner swap earlier this week. But even as the US government celebrates their return, dozens of Americans are currently being held hostage or wrongfully detained in 16 countries across the world. Data from the James W Foley Legacy Foundation - named after a journalist kidnapped and killed in Syria - suggests that more than 40 Americans are unjustly held abroad, many of them for years after sham trials. Majority of the cases mentioned in the report, 78%, involved a wrongful detention by state actors like China, Iran or Russia. The rest are hostage cases by non-state actors including Hamas, which is currently holding at least five American citizens. But the true figure of those detained abroad is likely higher. The families of some US detainees have purposely avoided the spotlight, while others have yet to be designated as wrongfully detained by the US. Here's a few of the cases that we know about: Among the Americans still being held in Russia are Ksenia Karelina, a 32-year-old amateur ballerina and spa employee based in California. In February, Russian authorities announced that Ms Karelina - a dual citizen who was visiting family members in the country - was arrested on treason charges. The charges allegedly stemmed from a $51.89 (£40.43) donation to a New York-based charity that buys gear for Ukrainian emergency workers. Following the US-Russia prisoner swap, Ms Karelina's boyfriend, Christopher van Heerden, told Reuters that he was disappointed that she was not included in the deal. ""I'm happy for the people, the Americans, who have returned to their families,"" he said. ""This makes me hopeful. At the same time, I'm heartbroken and sad...she's not on the list."" Ms Karelina's trial is expected to begin next week. While the US government has not commented publicly on the case, Mr van Heerden said they were aware and sought to not ""upset"" Russian authorities before the trial. Freelance journalist and former US Marine Austin Tice, 31, was kidnapped in August 2012 while working in Syria. While no government or group claimed responsibility for his disappearance, US officials soon said they believed that he was being held by the Syrian government - a position they have since maintained. Syria's government has said it is unaware of Mr Tice's whereabouts. In 2022, US President Joe Biden met the Tice family and said that the US knew ""with certainty"" that he was being held by the Syrian government. In May this year, Mr Biden again mentioned Mr Tice as being ""held hostage"". After 12 years, he is now believed to be the longest-held US journalist in history. Marc Fogel, 63, a teacher at the Anglo-American School of Moscow, was arrested at an airport in August 2021 and charged with carrying a small amount of medical marijuana which had been prescribed in the US. He is currently serving a 14-year prison sentence and has reportedly been teaching English to fellow inmates. In the wake of the US-Russia prisoner swap, Ms Fogel's family said in a statement that he was ""left behind again"". ""Marc has been unjustly detained for far too long and must be prioritised in any swap negotiations with Russia, regardless of his level of notoriety or sobriety,"" the statement added. On 1 August, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that the US was ""actively working to get his release"". When asked about the Fogel case the following day, President Biden said that ""we're not giving up on that"". Mark Swidan, a Texas businessman and graphic designer, has been imprisoned in China on drug charges since 2012. He denies the charges. A later United Nations review of the charges found that Mr Swidan - who was in China to buy flooring supplies at the time of his arrest - was not in the country at the time of his alleged crime. The US government considers him, along with two other Americans, as being wrongfully detained in China. In April, his mother Katherine Swidan told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that the family was ""very concerned and afraid that Mark will end his life"". The family has also alleged that Mr Swidan has undergone torture while in Chinese custody, including having both hands broken and his kneecaps dislocated. ""His leg is so swollen that they may not be able to get the brace off his leg without cutting it off,"" Ms Swidan said in a February news conference. ""He's ill. He's eating only bread."" New York native Ryan Corbett was arrested after returning to Afghanistan in August 2022 after having left the country when the Taliban swept to power the previous year. He had previously lived in the country for many years, and ran and supervised projects for a number of NGOs. To date, Mr Corbett has not been charged with a crime. Taliban officials have told CBS that he was involved in ""anti-state"" activities. He is among three US citizens the US government believes are being held by the Taliban, who have expressed an interest in freeing them in exchange for Afghan citizens still held by the US. In March, his family said they received a ""disturbing call"" from Mr Corbett in Afghanistan in which he ""exhibited a significantly deteriorated mental state"". ""I want the president to realise that the lack of action to bring Ryan home could have disastrous consequences,"" his wife Anna told CBS. While US officials have held several meetings with Taliban representatives to secure his release, they have not disclosed whether any progress has been made. Several US lawmakers, including New York representative Claudia Tenney, have also publicly called for his release. US defence secretary Lloyd Austin says he did not agree to deal and relieves officer overseeing court of authority.

2,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-03 05:36:43.000,"Two years, secret talks, high stakes: How prisoner swap deal was struck",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6p2p4e43lro,2024-08-02 05:56:05.000,"When a notorious Russian assassin and an American newspaper correspondent boarded separate planes in Turkey on Thursday, it marked the culmination of a secretive, dramatic prisoner swap deal between Russia and the West that was years in the making. The origins of this deal, which involved two dozen prisoners, can be traced back to 2022. But behind-the-scenes negotiations between Russia, the US and four European countries ramped up earlier this year before intensifying in recent weeks as a final agreement came into view for all sides. Those negotiations were at times feverish and testing. They also came as US-Russia tensions soared over the Ukraine war. ""It was the culmination of many rounds of complex, painstaking negotiations over many, many months,"" Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser who played a critical role in the deal, said shortly after the exchange. Senior White House officials provided a detailed timeline of events in a call with reporters, including from the BBC's US partner CBS, on Thursday. They said the first hint that Moscow may have been open to a deal came in the autumn of 2022. The US and Russia had been negotiating the release of Brittney Griner, the American basketball star who was arrested for possessing cannabis oil and sent to a Russian penal colony. Griner was eventually released later that year in a high-profile swap for the notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. But during those conversations, the White House officials said, Russia made clear it also wanted to secure the release of the hitman Vadim Krasikov, who was serving a life sentence in Germany for shooting dead a man in a busy Berlin park on the direct orders of the Kremlin. Mr Sullivan told his German counterpart that Russia was angling for Krasikov's release, and asked whether Berlin would consider freeing him in exchange for Alexei Navalny, the vocal anti-Putin campaigner and opposition leader who was being held in Russia. Germany, however, was reluctant to release a hitman who had committed such a brazen murder on its own soil. While Mr Sullivan did not get a definitive answer from Berlin, the initial conversations in 2022, both between the US and Russia and the US and Germany, helped pave the way for the larger, more complex agreement struck in recent weeks that was completed on the sweltering runway of a Turkish airport. That's because both sides signalled, at least to some extent, what they wanted. Russia made clear it wanted Krasikov. And Washington did not just want Navalny, it also wanted Paul Whelan, an ex-Marine who was jailed on espionage charges in Russia in 2018. The early elements of a potential swap deal then began to take shape - but there was still a long, long way to go. In late March 2023, a 31-year-old Wall Street Journal reporter from New Jersey was arrested by Russian intelligence agents while on a reporting trip. His detention raised a chorus of condemnation from the US and its allies. A day later, President Biden instructed Mr Sullivan to pull together a deal that would bring him, and Mr Whelan, home. The US directly contacted Russia. Communication then began in earnest, White House officials said, and their respective foreign ministers spoke on the phone. But the conversations soon moved from these top diplomats to the secretive intelligence services, which the US was hesitant to do as Mr Gershkovich was accused of spying and Washington feared involving the CIA would only fuel those claims. As the wheels of these tense negotiations were turning in late 2023, the US came to understand that the release of the hitman Krasikov was key to any successful deal, according to senior White House officials. Offers were made to Russia that did not include the 58-year-old assassin. They were always rebuffed. Given Krasikov was in jail in Germany and not the US, Washington did not have the power to free him unilaterally. Mr Sullivan spoke to his German counterpart almost weekly in late 2023 and early January 2024 in an effort to convince him to exchange Krasikov and meet Russia’s key demand for this deal. Any potential agreement, according to the White House officials, absolutely hinged on Germany releasing Krasikov. Moscow’s position, they said, was ultimately that its jailed spies should be returned in exchange for the Americans it accused of spying. With this in mind, the US worked to find more Russian spies held by its allies who could form part of a major deal. US officials, diplomats and CIA staff travelled the world looking for friendly governments willing to release prisoners fitting that description, according to the Wall Street Journal. A sign of their success came on Thursday, when Russians were released from prisons in Poland, Slovenia and Norway. In February of this year, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz met President Biden at the White House. And according to the account provided by the White House officials on Thursday, they discussed options for a swap that included all the key people - Krasikov, Navalny, Whelan, Gershkovich. There were positive signals from Russia, too. In an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson in early February, Vladimir Putin spoke about Mr Gershkovich. ""I do not rule out that Mr Gershkovich may return to his homeland,"" he said. As the BBC's Russia editor Steve Rosenberg writes, it was a very public and unsubtle hint: Moscow was open to doing a deal. But on 16 February 2024, just days after that interview and the White House meeting between Chancellor Scholz and President Biden, and before any offer could put to the Russians, the potential deal collapsed in tragic circumstances. Arguably the most high-profile prisoner who could have been included in the exchange, Alexei Navalny, died in his Siberian prison cell aged 47. Supporters and relatives, as well as many foreign leaders, blamed Mr Putin for his death. Russian authorities said he died of natural causes. While almost nothing was known about the negotiations at the time of his death, Mr Navalny's colleague Maria Pevchikh said publicly that he had been close to being freed in exchange for Krasikov. BBC News was unable to independently verify her claims at the time. The Kremlin, meanwhile, publicly denied that a potential agreement had been close. But on Thursday, the White House confirmed it had been working to include Mr Navalny in the deal, which ultimately saw three people who had worked with the opposition figure freed from Russian custody. ""The team felt like the wind had been taken out of our sails,” a visibly emotional Mr Sullivan said as he described the impact of Mr Navalny’s death. Mr Gershkovich's mother and father, in a dramatic coincidence, were meeting Mr Sullivan at the White House on the day Mr Navalny’s death was announced. Recognising the significance of the news and the risk it posed to these negotiations, he told them it was ""going to be a little bit more of a rocky path"" going forward. The potential deal had to be restructured and the US and Germany regrouped. Vice-President Kamala Harris then held two important meetings to help keep a potential swap on track, a senior administration official told the BBC. She attended the Munich Security Conference in mid-February where she stressed the importance of releasing Krasikov to Chancellor Scholz. She also met the prime minister of Slovenia, where two Russian prisoners identified by the US as being of a high priority to Moscow were being held. They were both released on Thursday. Then in the spring, the new deal which no longer included Mr Navalny took shape in the White House. And in June, Berlin agreed to exchange Krasikov. ""For you, I will do this,"" Mr Scholz told President Biden, according to Mr Sullivan. The deal was submitted to Russia. Moscow responded several weeks ago, in mid-July, accepting the terms of the agreement and the release of those on the list held in Russian jails. But as the negotiations were reaching their final stages, domestic politics intruded, with Mr Biden coming under immense pressure from within his own Democratic Party to end his bid for re-election in November after a poor debate performance. According to Mr Sullivan, barely an hour before Mr Biden announced on 21July he would not seek re-election, he was on a call with his Slovenian counterpart finalising the prisoner swap. As with any high-stakes prisoner swap, the deal was not guaranteed even as the aircraft were lined up and the prisoners' routes home finalised. ""We held our breath and crossed our fingers until just a couple of hours ago,"" Mr Sullivan said on Thursday afternoon. President Biden later posted a picture of the released Americans together on a plane headed for US soil, along with a short caption. ""[They] are safe, free, and have begun their journeys back into the arms of their families."" US defence secretary Lloyd Austin says he did not agree to deal and relieves officer overseeing court of authority. Pentagon announces Middle East reinforcements as Iran says it will ""punish"" Israel for assassination of Hamas leader. With no woman having served as president, the state run by women could offer pointers for a route to the White House. Both also conveyed gratitude to the countries who worked to free them. The daughter of an Indian-born mother and Jamaican-born father, Kamala Harris began her career as a prosecutor. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

2,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-03 05:36:43.000,Biden burnishes his legacy with historic  prisoner swap,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd1e1ygx7r1o,2024-08-02 14:03:47.000,"Last month, President Joe Biden said that he had “no higher priority” than gaining the release of Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan from Russian prison. On Thursday night, after months of behind-the-scenes negotiations, arm-twisting and manoeuvring, Mr Biden and his Vice-President, Kamala Harris, exchanged hugs with the two men as they set foot at last on American soil. For Mr Biden, it was a valedictory turn in the final months of his presidency. For Ms Harris - the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee - it was a chance to share the limelight of a foreign policy success. In one particularly powerful moment, Mr Biden removed the American flag pin he always wears on his suit jacket lapel and put it on Mr Whelan. It was a tangible sign of the task accomplished and a promise fulfilled. The multilateral exchange of 24 prisoners with Russia – the largest such swap since the Cold War – represents a significant feather in the cap of a man who abandoned his re-election bid less than two weeks ago. Like many in the waning days of their White House tenures, Mr Biden has found that foreign policy is one area where a president, even when sidelined from electoral politics, can make a splash. Typically, this focus abroad occurs at the end of a second term, when the incumbent is unburdened by a re-election campaign and domestic attention is on the party's new nominee. Mr Biden's circumstances are unusual. The nearest historical parallel in the modern era is when President Lyndon Baines Johnson stood down his re-election bid because of growing discontent with his handling of the Vietnam War. That war dominated Mr Johnson's final months in office – and represented his political undoing. Mr Biden, on the other hand, has been able to take a victory lap with this prisoner swap, basking in the joy of families of the released Americans at the White House on Thursday, after more than a month of personal and political turmoil. Mr Biden's month of turmoil, which began with a catastrophic debate performance in late June, culminated in last week's Oval Office address to the nation, where he discussed his decision to drop his re-election campaign. While he conceded that it was time to ""pass the torch"", his speech included a reminder that his presidential term wasn’t over and that his work wasn't done. It came with a heavy serving of foreign policy promises. He said he would bring home detained Americans - which Thursday’s news significantly advanced. He also pledged to continue to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian invaders - which recent congressional funding has guaranteed well into next year. And he said he would work to end the war in Gaza ""and bring peace and security to the Middle East"". On that last item, the news has been trending from bad to worse in recent days. Tensions in the Middle East have been escalating dramatically. Israel was allegedly behind the assassination of a prominent Hamas political leader in Iran on Wednesday. The chances of a conflict between Israel and Hezbollah have grown, as the two sides exchanged attacks across the Israel-Lebanon border. An Israeli strike on Tuesday killed a senior Hezbollah leader, as well as an Iranian military advisor. The US State Department has warned American citizens to avoid travel to Lebanon – reflecting the growing concern of a widening regional conflict. Mr Biden, who once chaired the Senate Foreign Relations committee and oversaw an international portfolio as Barack Obama's vice-president, touted his foreign policy chops as he campaigned for president in 2020. But the Middle East has proven to be a diplomatic graveyard for even the most capable US foreign policy hands. While achieving the kind of lasting ""peace and security"" Mr Biden envisions would become a remarkable accomplishment, it seems as far off now as any point since the war began nearly 10 months ago. While foreign policy successes could bolster Mr Biden's legacy, the president's place in the history books – and, in particular, how he is viewed by his members of his own party – hinges most directly on the fate of his chosen successor. Although Ms Harris was not with the president at the White House on Thursday afternoon, she joined the president in greeting the newly released prisoners as they returned to US soil. The White House also has been quick to credit the vice-president for playing a key role in negotiating details of the complex multilateral prisoner exchange with US allies. A senior Biden administration official told the BBC that Ms Harris' February meetings with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Prime Minister Robert Golob of Slovenia at the Munich Security Conference were particularly crucial. Meanwhile, the Republican presidential ticket has quickly attempted to minimise any political benefits from the prisoner swap – both by taking credit for it and by questioning its wisdom. During a rally in Arizona, Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance said that the exchange was really a reflection of what he said was the increasing likelihood that Donald Trump would win in November. ""There's a real sense that the world leaders are afraid that if Donald Trump comes in, they’re going to have to start behaving again,"" he said. ""The bad guys worry that Donald Trump will be back and the free ride is over.” The former president himself posted a lengthy response on his social media website, questioning Mr Biden’s negotiating strategy and speculating about the details of the exchange. ""We never make good deals, at anything, but especially hostage swaps,"" he wrote. ""Our 'negotiators' are always an embarrassment to us!"" The Russian asking price for the release of Mr Gershkovich and Mr Whelan - along with Russian-American radio journalist Alsu Kurmasheva and a group of Russian dissidents - was unquestionably high. It included Russian intelligence agents convicted of an assassination and espionage. But the president and his senior staff, in their remarks on Thursday, said the deal was worth it. Mr Biden also took a moment to tout his foreign policy vision in what could be an implied contrast with the former president's ""America first"", go-it-alone international outlook. ""Today is a powerful example of why it's vital to have friends in this world and friends you can trust, work with and depend upon, especially on matters of great consequence and sensitivity like this,"" he said. ""Our alliances make our people safer."" It was a pointed message from a president whose opportunities to pull the national spotlight his way – and to burnish his legacy – are diminishing as the final days of his presidency tick away. US defence secretary Lloyd Austin says he did not agree to deal and relieves officer overseeing court of authority. Pentagon announces Middle East reinforcements as Iran says it will ""punish"" Israel for assassination of Hamas leader. With no woman having served as president, the state run by women could offer pointers for a route to the White House.

2,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-03 05:36:43.000,Who are the prisoners in the Russia-West swap? ,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjjwexqj11xo,2024-08-02 10:28:06.000,"The US has confirmed 24 people were involved in a prisoner exchange between Russia and some Western countries including the US and Germany. Among the prisoners released are the US citizens Evan Gershkovich - a Wall Street Journal reporter - and former US Marine Paul Whelan. As part of the deal, Russian security service hitman Vadim Krasikov has been freed by Germany. There had been speculation for days about a major swap between Russia and Western countries, which was heightened after several prisoners were moved from their prison cells in Russian jails to unknown locations. US journalist Evan Gershkovich was sentenced to 16 years in a high-security penal colony earlier this month after being convicted on espionage charges. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reporter was first arrested by security services last March while on a reporting trip in the city of Yekaterinburg, about 1,600km (1,000 miles) east of Moscow. Prosecutors accused him of working for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), accusations that Mr Gershkovich, the WSJ and the US government vociferously deny. It marked the first conviction of a US journalist for espionage in Russia since the Cold War ended more than 30 years ago. After his initial arrest, he was held in Moscow's notorious Lefortovo prison. Paul Whelan, 54, was given a 16-year jail sentence in 2020 after being arrested in Moscow on suspicion of spying in 2018. The ex-US Marine is a citizen of four countries - the US, Canada, the UK and Ireland. His lawyer said he was being held in a prison in the Mordovia region. After being discharged from the military in 2008 for bad conduct, he became a security consultant and started to travel back and forth to Russia for work. In December 2018, he was arrested by Russia's FSB state security agency, which claimed he had been ""caught spying"" in Moscow. His family has always denied the charges. On the same day Mr Gershkovich was convicted, Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva was sentenced to six-and-a-half years in a medium-security prison after a secret trial. She was an editor for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, which is funded by the US government, and was convicted of spreading false information about the Russian military. Her husband, Pavel Butorin, previously said she was arrested over a book published last year, which was a collection of stories about Russians opposed to the war in Ukraine. Ms Kurmasheva holds US and Russian citizenship and lived in Prague with her husband and two daughters. She was detained in June 2023 while visiting her mother in Russia. Vladimir Kara-Murza is a prominent Russian dissident, one of the most vocal opponents of the Putin regime, and an outspoken critic of the war in Ukraine and the internal crackdown on dissent in Russia. In 2023, the 42-year-old was sentenced to 25 years in prison for spreading ""false"" information about the Russian army and being affiliated with an ""undesirable organisation"". Mr Kara-Murza - a former journalist and politician - denied all the charges. The dual British-Russian citizen had spent his term in a prison colony in Siberia, where his wife said he developed a neurological condition as a result of being poisoned. One of Russia's most prominent opposition figures, Ilya Yashin was jailed in 2022 for ""spreading fake news"" about the country's military. He was arrested after he condemned suspected Russian war crimes in Bucha. Following the death of former opposition leader Alexei Navalny in prison, Mr Yashin said he feared for his life. He previously accused President Vladimir Putin of going “mad with power” in a series of letters from the prison in the western Smolensk region where he was being held. Oleg Orlov is a Russian human rights activist who was jailed in February for calling Russia a fascist state and criticising the war in Ukraine. He was previously the chair of the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Memorial. The 71-year-old was handed a two-and-a-half-year term for ""repeatedly discrediting"" the Russian armed forces. In an appeal aginst his sentence in July, he compared the Russian justice system to that of Nazi Germany. His sentencing followed a retrial. In the original trial in October last year, he received a 150,000-rouble fine (£1,290; $1,630) and walked free from the court. His later conviction marked a hardening of repressions against opponents of the war. Lilia Chanysheva was sentenced to nine-and-a-half years in prison earlier this year after being accused of extremism by authorities. She had served as a local co-ordinator with the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s anti-corruption network. She was initially sentenced to seven years in 2023, but prosecutors appealed against the sentence and told officials it was too lenient. She was most recently held at a centre in the Perm region. Ms Chanysheva was the first of Mr Navalny’s allies sentenced on the charge. Most of his other activists have fled Russia into exile. Ksenia Fadeyeva was sentenced to nine years in prison by authorities after she was accused of organising an extremist group. She had been a local organiser with Alexei Navalny’s anti-corruption foundation in the Siberian city of Tomsk, where she was subsequently detained. Her lawyers argued that she had ended her association with the organisation before it was designated an extremist group in 2021. Most of Mr Navalny’s former staff and allies have been forced to flee Russia into exile in recent years, as the Kremlin has ramped up repression of opposition groups. Sasha Skochilenko was sentenced to seven years in a penal colony for replacing supermarket pricing labels with anti-war messages in November as a form of protest. The replacement labels drew attention to civilian deaths in Mariupol and said Russia had become a ""fascist state"". The artist from St Petersburg had been held in a detention centre in the city since April 2023. German-Russian citizen Kevin Lik was convicted of treason as a teenager, becoming the youngest person ever to be found guilty of the crime. He grew up in Germany and moved to Russia when he was 12. Authorities sentenced him to four years in prison last December for supposedly emailing pictures to “representatives of a foreign state” before and during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The court claimed he had visited and photographed “deployment sites” of Russian troops. German national Rico Krieger was accused of planting explosives in Belarus and sentenced to death, before being pardoned by the country’s leader Alexander Lukashenko earlier this week. In a heavily choreographed interview on state-controlled media, he said he was acting on instruction from Ukraine, but no evidence was given. He is believed to have been the first Western citizen ever to be given the death penalty in Belarus. Russian opposition activist Andrei Pivovarov headed the Open Russia foundation, which was established by former oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who spent a decade in prison for campaigning against Mr Putin. He was arrested in 2021 after trying to leave the country from St Petersburg, accused of directing an “undesirable organisation”. In an interview for the Meduza website, his mother, who lives in the city, said she had been expecting him home in September when his sentence was due to end. She said he had called her from Germany and told her not to worry, adding: ""I don't know what happens next, but for now this is the best option."" Russian-German citizen Dieter Voronin was sentenced to 13 years in prison on ""treason"" charges after Moscow alleged he received classified military information from another journalist, Ivan Safronov, who remains behind bars, AFP reported. The 38-year-old German was detained in St Petersburg earlier this year after reportedly being found with a packet of cannabis gummy bears. He was accused of drug trafficking. Schoebel explained in court that he bought the bears in Germany last year and took them before long-haul flights to help him sleep. He said he didn't know they were banned in Russia. Russian-German immigration lawyer and cycling campaigner Mozhyes is facing treason charges after being arrested in May. Little is known about his case, but human rights activists suggest the charges may be connected to his work in helping Russian citizens with European documents, or simply to his nationality. The Insider website describes a dramatic first attempt to arrest him as he was cycling in St Petersburg. Apparently he confused the manoeuvres made by the security forces' car to stop him with a case of bad driving and simply evaded capture. He was later detained outside his home and has spent the last few months in custody in Moscow's Lefortovo prison. Ostanin was the head of Alexei Navalny's regional branch in Barnaul, sentenced to nine years in jail in 2023. Like the other Navalny representatives in the swap, he was charged with belonging to an extremist organisation. In May of that year, while in custody awaiting trial, he said that his health was deteriorating because of his confinement. One of the most high-profile prisoners to be released back to Russia is Federal Security Service (FSB) agent Vadim Krasikov, who was serving a life sentence in Germany for the 2019 murder of an exiled Chechen commander in a Berlin park. During his trial, prosecutors said he was acting on orders from Russia, and that he belonged to a highly secretive Vympel unit of the FSB. Lawyers defending him insisted he was a construction worker, not a hitman. He denied being known as Krasikov, and identified himself as Vadim Sokolov, the name on the passport he was travelling with. In a recent interview with US talk show host Tucker Carlson, Mr Putin hinted his country was seeking “patriot” Krasikov’s release in exchange for US journalist Evan Gershkovich. Roman Seleznev was found guilty of running a hacking scheme in 2017 that caused $169m (£131m) in damages. US officials said he stole credit card data from restaurants and sold it on the black market. He was sentenced to 27 years in prison for the scheme, which prosecutors say he ran between 2009 and 2013. According to the Justice Department, Mr Seleznev used software which enabled him to steal millions of credit card numbers from thousands of businesses. His father is Valery Seleznev, an MP and ally of Mr Putin. The US charged Vadim Konoshchenok with conspiracy related to procurement and money-laundering on behalf of the Russian government in 2022. He was also thought to have been an FSB agent. At the time, a statement from the US Department of Justice said he and others unlawfully purchased and exported highly sensitive electronic components, some of which can be used for military purposes. Husband and wife Artem Viktorovich Dultsev and Anna Valerevna Dultseva were arrested and convicted on espionage charges in Slovenia. They were each sentenced to 19 months in prison. Their two children also returned to Russia with them. University lecturer Mikhail Valeryevich Mikushin was charged with gathering intelligence in Norway on behalf of Russia in 2022 while posing as a Brazilian academic. Norwegian officials said he had a Brazilian passport and had worked as a researcher at the University of Tromso since 2021. He had reportedly been going by the name José Assis Giammaria. Mr Mikushin was also believed to have lied about his age, being in fact 44 rather than 37 when charged. Arrested in Switzerland at the request of the US authorities in 2021, Klyushin was jailed for nine years in 2023 for insider trading after refusing a plea deal. During the investigation, he was linked to former military intelligence officer Ivan Yermakov, who was allegedly involved in efforts to influence the 2016 US election in Donald Trump's favour. In Russia, the cybersecurity company he headed, M-13, was also responsible for the Katyusha programme, employed by the authorities to monitor media outlets and blogging sites. The Spanish-Russian journalist was arrested in Poland in February 2022, shortly after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, accused of espionage and links to Russian military intelligence. Born Pavel Rubtsov in Moscow to descendants of Basque emigrees, he moved to Spain as a child and changed his name to Pablo González. After his arrest, a campaign to free him was launched involving Amnesty International and Reporters without Borders (RSF). In a statement in February this year, RSF urged his release, noting that he still had not been charged by the Polish authorities. This story will be updated as the names of more released prisoners are confirmed US defence secretary Lloyd Austin says he did not agree to deal and relieves officer overseeing court of authority.

2,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-03 05:36:43.000,"Whisper it, but is now a good time to holiday in Paris?",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7970gz3qro,2024-08-02 12:44:05.000,"For all those concerns about high prices and big crowds ahead of the Olympics, now might just be an unexpectedly good time to holiday in Paris. Hotels and restaurants have told the BBC they have dropped their prices to entice customers - after what some call a “catastrophic” downturn in takings during the Games that have left them asking what the event has done for them. The French capital might seem to be the centre of the world for those watching the sport on TV – but the city’s relatively quiet streets and empty dining tables tell a different story. Earlier this week, local media ran reports of a “deserted” Disneyland and of Parisians’ bemusement as they managed to secure seats on metro trains at rush hour. So, what is happening? Analysts suggest that many Parisians have left the city in droves for the summer, as is their tradition. But also, some overseas visitors have been put off by concerns around price-gouging and overcrowding on an Olympic scale. One of the locals who used the word “catastrophic” was a restaurateur called Lies in the usually bustling Latin Quarter, who said July had been his worst month for 25 years. During the height of Covid, at least people continued to order meal deliveries, he told the BBC. Tourists had been put off coming to the area because of security blockades that were put in the place for the previous week’s opening ceremony, Lies suggested. Another nearby restaurateur hovering in his doorway, Yarva, said would-be visitors had chosen not to pay hotel prices which multiplied several times ahead of the Games. The event was “only for the rich”, he said, and used a hand gesture to indicate he thought the price inflation had been crazy. Ahead of the Games, airlines warned there was a low appetite for journeys to Paris, with both Delta and the company that owns Air France predicting an impact on their business. “Unless you’re going to the Olympics, people aren’t going to Paris,” the Delta boss told CNBC. This was reflected in flight prices that were well below the usual asking price for this time of year, according to travel expert Simon Calder, writing this week for The Independent. Next-day one-way flights from UK cities were as low as £31 (€36; $39) per adult (from Edinburgh) at the time of writing this article. However, tickets for the Eurostar trains, which were last week affected by a sabotage attack on the French railway network, were considerably higher. June and July saw an “avoidance effect”, said Raphael Batko of hotel marketing firm Doyield, which represents about one in 20 of the city’s hotels. He also used the word “catastrophic” to describe the phenomenon, though he said visitor numbers had picked up and were now satisfactory. A similar avoidance phenomenon has been noticed in previous Olympics, including in London in 2012, when businesses suggested that the Games had deterred visitors and shrunk their profits. What remains to be seen is whether the emergency action taken by the hospitality industry will be enough to salvage the Olympic trade for many Parisian businesses. With restaurants dropping their prices, it was now possible to get a meal for as little as €8 (£6.80, $8.70) in the Latin Quarter, claimed Riad, the proprietor of the Olympie diner, as he tried to entice diners. Hotels, too have tried a similar trick – largely reversing the earlier rises which appear to have been so off-putting. Tourism authorities confirmed that average prices had returned to €258 (£219; $279) per night during the Games, following a massive hike that had previously seen them peak at €342 last month. The BBC saw that a number of Airbnbs on offer were advertising price reductions, although the company said prices had remained stable since the start of the year, and more locals had been opening their homes in host cities. Individual hoteliers in Paris spoke of mixed success. One reception manager, Dino, said bookings had reached normal levels - but only after rates were slashed by half when things “looked bleak”. Another, Isabelle, said her own price drop had been ineffective and lamented that “we didn’t gain anything from the Olympics”. As well as the sport, there were plenty of good reasons to come to the French capital for the summer, said Christophe Decloux, head of the Choose Paris regional tourist board. He cited the city’s rich cultural offering, plus smooth transportation and a “very joyful” atmosphere during the Games. “Paris is usually very calm in late July and August because people leave for the holidays,” he said, “and right now it is just as calm as usual in August except in some areas around the venues where people are bonding over the sport.” Organisers of Paris 2024 have trumpeted the positive effects of the Games on Paris following record ticket sales. It remains possible to sign up to see events, as tickets are released each day. About 800,000 of them are still up for grabs, organisers told the BBC on Friday. The sporting spectacle itself has already proven memorable - and with some disgruntled businesses doing everything they can to coax in visitors, last-minute bookers to Paris might find themselves in with a chance of scoring a bargain.

2,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-03 05:36:43.000,Venezuelans fear for relatives after mass arrests,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c147k7kzvwko,2024-08-02 05:11:30.000,"“I haven’t been able to see him. Or give him food. Or hand him his clothes. I don’t know if he has been beaten. I don’t know if he has bathed. Or eaten.” ‘Isabella’, who did not want to be named, is desperately worried for her son. Through tears, she explains that he, 28, and his girlfriend, 17, were arrested and beaten after the family joined a march in Caracas protesting against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro the day after Sunday’s presidential election. Mr Maduro claimed victory, which was instantly disputed by the opposition who say they have evidence from electronic voting machines that they, not the government, won. They and many governments around the world have demanded proof from President Maduro that he won the election. He has said he will publish the vote tallies, but not when. Opposition leader María Corina Machado has called for protests “in every city” in Venezuela on Saturday against President Maduro and the disputed election result. She said on social media “we must remain firm, organised and mobilised with the pride of having achieved a historic victory on 28 July"". The government has said Ms Machado should be arrested. It comes after Ms Machado wrote in the Wall Street Journal she is in “hiding” and fearing for her “life” and “freedom.” So far, the Venezuelan government says more than 1,000 people have been arrested in protests set off by the disputed election. Isabella has very little information about her son. She has been waiting anxiously outside the police station where she believes he is, hoping for answers. She says on Monday the National Guard “unjustly grabbed” her son and others at the march: “They were not harming anyone. They did not have stones. They did not have weapons. They only protested. ""They beat him. They accused them of being terrorists for defending their country, for wanting change,” she says. “We went out to march because we want a change, because we can no longer stand this government. There is so much misery, so much hunger, so much crime, so much injustice towards innocent people, many people dying in hospitals.” She shows us a photograph of her granddaughter who she says died in December last year because there was no oxygen for treatment in the hospital where she was. “There were 12 children who died because there was no oxygen,” she says. “I want Venezuela to be the same as before, where we work with dignity. Where we earned a decent salary. Where our children and grandchildren could study. My daughter and son left university because there are no teachers. “The government does not want kids to study, it wants us to continue in misery, to be ignorant, to not speak out. How is it possible that you go to a hospital and you have to buy everything? There is no oxygen. There is nothing.” She said her son was accused of “terrorism” which can carry a sentence of years in prison, but she says the government has no evidence. Alberto Romero, a lawyer with the human rights group Foro Penal, said there were about 200 people detained just in the police station where Isabella has been waiting, including children. “There are 11 minors here,” he said. “It’s totally illegal. This is not actually a prison, it’s just a police station. It’s not possible for lawyers to get in. No one has had the opportunity to see these people that are being detained, we don’t know the conditions."" The judiciary in Venezuela is controlled by the government. “The people detained are not allowed private defenders. Public defenders are part of the state. So the one who accused you, is the one who defends you,” he added. He said that many of the families who he is representing had relatives detained for just “walking in the street” on the day of protests, adding the purpose was “intimidation” of the Venezuelan people. Foro Penal have verified and identified 711 people who have been detained and 11 people who have died since 29 August when protests began.  Venezuela's attorney general has said there have been more than 1,000 detentions. An opposition politician, Freddy Superlano, who has been a fierce critic of President Maduro has also been detained. A video shared on social media showed six men putting him in a van and taking him away. His family have demanded proof that he is still alive and do not know his whereabouts. On Wednesday, President Maduro asked the Supreme Court to act against protesters – paving the way for further arrests. His government has also accused the opposition leader, Ms Machado, and its presidential candidate, Edmundo González, of inciting violence by disputing the election result and has said they should be arrested. President Maduro called the opposition leaders a “perverse and macabre duo who have to take responsibility” for protesters he described as “criminals.” He has strongly denied electoral fraud and has accused the opposition of instigating a “coup”. But, in an intervention, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington rejected Mr Maduro’s ""unsubstantiated allegations"" against opposition leaders. In a statement Mr Blinken said threats to arrest Ms Machado and Mr González ""are an undemocratic attempt to repress political participation and retain power"". ""All Venezuelans arrested while peacefully exercising their right to participate in the electoral process or demand transparency in the tabulation and announcement of results should be released immediately,"" Mr Blinken added. ""Law enforcement and security forces should not become an instrument of political violence used against citizens exercising their democratic rights."" Despite the spectre of detentions growing, many Venezuelans are determined to continue protesting – although some are deterred by fear. Isabella, in spite of what happened to her son, described the protests as “incredible”. “Everyone now has internet, WiFi, Instagram, TikTok. Everyone passed a statement through the neighbourhoods saying ‘Let’s March. Let’s join for a better Venezuela'.” She explained how the slum neighbourhood of Petare, which used to be a stronghold for the president “began to descend” from the mountains to the city. “They started to go down, shouting, with pots, pans, and flags. Barefoot children, mothers carrying children to the march. ""The colectivo [armed paramilitaries who support Mr Maduro] yelled at us, cursed us, threw stones at us, told us ‘Viva Maduro!’ The authorities started throwing tear gas at us. ""We don’t know how this is going to end. We don’t want dead people.” Jordan Goudreau, 48, allegedly sent weapons, ammunition and other gear without a US export licence. The opposition says it has proof President Maduro's victory claim is fraudulent; his defence minster has warned of a ""coup"".

2,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-03 05:36:43.000,How stage was set for biggest prisoner swap since Cold War,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj50l9dy3emo,2024-08-01 15:55:49.000,"“This is a matter best dealt with in silence.” It’s the phrase of choice of Russian officials when asked to comment on possible East-West prisoner exchanges. Words we’ve been hearing for months. This is how the Kremlin likes it: deal-making behind closed doors, ""hostage diplomacy"" far from the media spotlight. Intelligence service talking to intelligence service; government to government. Until Moscow gets what – or rather whom – it wants. But despite the ""silence"", there were signals. Something was moving. In an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson last February, Vladimir Putin spoke about Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter who had been arrested in Russia and charged with espionage. “I do not rule out that Mr Gershkovich may return to his homeland,” Mr Putin said. “We want the US special services to think about how they can contribute to achieving the goals our special services are pursuing.” It was a very public and unsubtle hint: Moscow was open to doing a deal. The Kremlin leader didn’t name names. But he made it quite clear whom Russia wanted in return: Vadim Krasikov, the suspected Russian agent who was serving a life sentence for murder - not in America, but in Germany. A few days later, Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny died in a remote Arctic penal colony. Rumours swirled that before his death, talks had been under way on exchanging Mr Navalny, Evan Gershkovich and former US marine Paul Whelan, all jailed in Russia, for Vadim Krasikov in Germany. Had the German authorities entered negotiations on a prisoner swap? Fast forward to June. Evan Gershkovich’s closed-door spy trial – dismissed as a “sham” by the Wall Street Journal and the US government - finally began in Yekaterinburg. The case was quickly adjourned until mid-August. But last month, the court unexpectedly brought the second hearing forward by more than three weeks. At the end of a lightning-fast three-day trial, Evan Gershkovich was convicted and sentenced to 16 years in a penal colony. The very same day, US-Russian journalist Alsu Kurmasheva was sentenced to six-and-a-half years in prison by a court in Kazan. Her trial had lasted just two days. Someone was clearly in a hurry. It was the strongest sign yet that a deal had been done, that a swap was likely. The Russian authorities normally treat a conviction as a prerequisite for any prisoner exchange. Earlier this week - more signals, with reports that a string of prominent Russian political prisoners had been moved from their penal colonies or detention centres. Speculation grew. Might these dissidents be part of a larger prisoner exchange than had originally been anticipated? News broke in Belarus: the country’s leader, Alexander Lukashenko, had agreed to pardon Rico Krieger, a German citizen sentenced to death on terrorism and other charges. Could he be part of a swap? Now we know. This is the largest East-West prisoner exchange since the Cold War. Western governments will welcome the release of foreigners, as well as freedom for some of Russia’s most prominent political prisoners. Moscow will celebrate the return of its agents. Both sides will claim it’s a good deal. But if Russia concludes, as it has done in the past, that ""hostage diplomacy"" works, then worryingly, this is unlikely to be the last time that prisoners here – both foreigners and Russians – are used as bargaining chips. The deal between Russia and the West followed a tumultuous, dramatic path until its completion on Thursday. Hungarian PM Viktor Orban sparked anger last week by accusing the EU of pursuing a ""pro-war policy"". Since the invasion of Ukraine, the measures used to clamp down on Kremlin critics have swelled. Vadim Shamarin oversaw military communications when he was accused of taking bribes from a factory. The Hungarian prime minister is a key Trump ally and has publicly endorsed his re-election bid.

2,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-03 05:36:43.000,Maduro manoeuvring to stay in power in Venezuela,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyj439myd1jo,2024-08-01 17:43:54.000,"There is turmoil in Venezuela following the announcement by a government-controlled electoral authority of a disputed election result that handed a third consecutive term in power to President Nicolás Maduro. The opposition says the result is fraudulent and that its candidate, Edmundo González, won the election by a wide margin. The National Electoral Council (CNE), which announced the contested result, has so far failed to provide the voting tallies from individual polling stations that the opposition says demonstrate Mr González is the winner. With pressure on the CNE growing to release the tallies, Mr Maduro has turned to Venezuela's top court. The move has caused concern. Here we explain why. Venezuela has an electronic voting system. Voters punch in a button assigned to their preferred candidate on a voting machine. Once the button is pressed, the machine also prints out a paper receipt. Voters place that receipt in a ballot box. Once polling stations close, the counting begins. Each voting machine prints out a summary of all the votes cast by voters who used that particular machine. Additionally, a count of the paper receipts is also conducted at each individual polling station to confirm the machine's printout is correct. By law, this process is public and anyone can witness it. There are also a number of accredited witnesses representing the different parties. Once the chair of the count and the accredited witnesses are satisfied that the numbers match, they sign the tally and it is sent electronically to the CNE. Accredited witnesses are handed a copy and paper printouts of the tallies are also transported to the CNE by the military. Out of the five members who make up Venezuela's National Electoral Council (CNE), three are staunch government allies. Its president, Elvis Amoroso, used to work as Mr Maduro's legal counsel. Fearing the CNE could tamper with the election results, the opposition got thousands of people to act as its official witnesses and - in addition - urged Venezuelan citizens to go to their polling stations to monitor the vote count. Just after midnight on election night, the CNE announced its first partial results. It said that with 80% of the votes counted, President Maduro had 5.15m votes compared to 4.44m votes for Mr González. CNE President Elvis Amoroso said that those figures meant that Mr Maduro had ""a convincing and irreversible lead"" with 51.2%, and that the opposition trailed with 44.2%. The opposition quickly contested those results. Its witnesses had provided it with copies of the voting tallies from polling stations across the country. Just hours after the election, opposition leader María Corina Machado announced that having seen 40% of the voting tallies, they could confirm that it was their candidate, not Mr Maduro who was in the lead. In the days following the election, the share of voting tallies the opposition has received has risen to 84%. The opposition says that those tallies show that Mr González won with 67% of the vote. Opposition campaigners have shared them with international organisations and independent researchers and uploaded them onto a website which Venezuelans can access by entering their ID number. They have also urged the CNE to make all the tallies public, arguing that they will show that the Maduro win which the electoral authority announced on election night was fraudulent. Latin American leaders, including left-wing leaders from Colombia and Brazil, have joined the US, the European Union and independent election observers in increasingly forceful demands for the CNE to finally release these tallies. On Wednesday, three days after the election, President Maduro said his coalition was ""ready to present 100% of the voting tallies that are in our hands"". He made the announcement at the Supreme Tribunal of Justice (TSJ), Venezuela's highest court. He had earlier blamed the CNE's delay in publishing the tallies on ""an unprecedented cyber attack"", which he alleged had disrupted the transmission of the tallies from the polling stations. But instead of making the tallies public, he took the unusual step of filing a ""writ of amparo"" - a legal move normally used by citizens who think their constitutional rights have been violated. He asked the top court to audit the voting tallies with a view to confirming the results provided by the CNE which handed him another six-year term in power. Mr Maduro's statement may look like he is bowing to pressure for the tallies to be made public. But by resorting to the top court, he has found a way to both deflect attention away from the CNE and to delay the publication of the tallies in one swoop. The ball is now in the court of the Supreme Tribunal (TSJ), whose justices are overwhelmingly government loyalists. The proceedings there are likely to be conducted behind closed doors, in which case even if Mr Maduro provides the tallies, only the justices will be able to access them. In the short term, this deflects the pressure from the CNE and also allows Mr Maduro to argue that he has complied with international requests to hand over the tallies. And in the medium term, should the court rule in his favour, he will hope this endorsement bolsters his claim that he is the winner of the election. However, this move has already been dismissed by independent bodies, including the Carter Center, which was invited by the Maduro government to observe the election. Jennie K. Lincoln, who led the Carter Center delegation, told AP news agency that the TSJ is ""another government institution, appointed by the government, to verify the government numbers for the election results, which are in question"". ""This is not an independent assessment."" This is not the first time that a Maduro electoral victory has been denounced as fraudulent. The 2018 election was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair after opposition candidates were jailed, barred from running or forced into exile. And it is not just the CNE's result of the 2024 election which has been questioned. The Carter Center, which has monitored more than 100 elections around the globe, cited a long list of problems with the electoral process, including: It concluded that the 2024 presidential election ""cannot be considered democratic"".   Jordan Goudreau, 48, allegedly sent weapons, ammunition and other gear without a US export licence. The opposition says it has proof President Maduro's victory claim is fraudulent; his defence minster has warned of a ""coup"".

2,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-03 05:36:43.000,Witness to Titan sub tragedy tells of fear and false hope,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw8y28zvvvwo,2024-07-31 23:41:35.000,"A witness to the Titan submersible disaster has told BBC News about the fear and false hope felt by those on its support ship. Rory Golden was on the Oceangate expedition when contact with the sub and its five passengers was lost on a dive to the Titanic in June 2023. “We had this image in our heads of them being down there, running out of oxygen in the freezing cold, getting terribly frightened and scared,” he said. But after learning the sub had imploded just hours into the dive, he said it was a comfort to know those onboard hadn’t suffered. Mr Golden was on the Polar Prince support ship to give presentations about the Titanic when the submersible went missing. “When the sub was overdue we weren't unduly concerned because communications break down a lot in the ocean,” he explained. “But when the alarm was finally raised, that's when we realised that there were some serious issues.” A major search and rescue operation was launched by the US Coast Guard. A few days in, underwater sounds detected by search aircraft raised hopes that these were coming from the missing sub. But it's now known that those onboard most likely died instantly after Titan suffered a catastrophic failure as it neared the Titanic at the bottom of the Atlantic. “We lived in false hope for four days,” Mr Golden said. “There’s still a lot of questions to be answered.” Those who perished were British explorer Hamish Harding, the British-Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman, Stockton Rush, the CEO of Oceangate, and French diver Paul Henri - or PH - Nargeolet. Rory Golden was a close friend of PH - a veteran deep sea explorer. He is now on the first expedition to the Titanic since the tragedy - an expedition that PH Nargeolet was supposed to be leading. A plaque is being laid in his honour at the wreck site and a memorial service for all those who died on the sub has been held at sea. Mr Golden told the BBC he was one of the last people to see PH alive. “He left the ship in great spirits, in great form and he was happy. He was going somewhere that he wanted to be.” Rory Golden had also visited the Titanic on the Oceangate sub. ”PH and I had discussed the submersible in the past and I had actually made a dive in it myself the year before,” he said. “And I'm here - as are many others. The Titan sub had made 15 dives to the Titanic up to that point, so it had worked. “I was comfortable, I spent 12 hours at the Titanic and it was a whole different experience being in a submersible that I could actually move around quite well in.” He told the BBC that he didn’t regret his dive at all. “It wasn't my time,” he said. “You never know when your time is going to come. And that certainly brought that home to all of us.” The discovery of the wreckage of Titan four days after it went missing confirmed the fate of those onboard. “We all cried when the remains were found of the sub,” he said. “A special bond has been formed between all of us who were there on the ship that week. And that's a bond that will always be there.” Industry experts had raised many serious questions about the safety of the Titan submersible prior to the dive. Investigations by the US Coast Guard and Canadian Coast Guard are still ongoing. They are likely to call for changes to ensure such a tragedy doesn’t happen again. A new expedition aims to document the world's most famous shipwreck in unprecedented detail. Graham Padden from Southport had a place booked but was unable to raise the money needed in time. The private submersible industry was shaken after the implosion of the OceanGate Titan sub last year. . Mary Roberts survived both the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 and the Rohilla in 1914.

2,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-03 05:36:43.000,Kenya rolls out poison in bid to cull a million crows,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c999n2nyvwlo,2024-08-01 06:43:48.000,"""Invasive alien birds"" sounds like the strapline to a scary Hollywood blockbuster but for the people of coastal Kenya it is not a matter of fiction. The authorities there are so worried about the nuisance created by Indian house crows that they have begun the process of culling a million of them. They have not targeted humans, as in the Alfred Hitchock horror film The Birds, but these ones have for decades caused widespread disruption, by preying on wildlife, raiding tourist areas and attacking poultry farms. Poison is now being used in the towns of Watamu and Malindi to kill the first tranche of the ruthless sub-species. This ambitious poisoning campaign is aimed at halting the crows’ advance towards the capital, Nairobi. The birds, known on the coast as ""kunguru"" or ""kurabu"", originated from India and other parts of Asia, often spreading elsewhere by travelling on trading ships. But they are believed to have been intentionally introduced in East Africa around 1890s in a bid to tackle a mounting waste problem on the Zanzibar archipelago, then a British protectorate. From there, they spread to the mainland and up the coast to Kenya. They were first recorded in the port of Mombasa in 1947 and since then, their numbers have exploded, thanks to the growing human population and the accompanying mounds of rubbish, which provide an ideal environment for the birds to feed and breed. They also have no natural predators. The Indian house crows, considered one of the world’s most invasive and destructive birds, have continued their northward journey. ""They prey on the indigenous species, not just birds but also mammals, reptiles - and so their impact on biodiversity is devastating,"" Jaap Gijsbertsen, a Dutch bird expert, who is visiting Kenya's Watamu area, told the BBC. Conservationists say that the crows have significantly reduced the number of small indigenous birds in the region, such as weavers and waxbills, by ripping their nests apart while targeting eggs and even chicks. ""When the population of local birds declines, the environment begins to suffer. There will be a possible increase of harmful pests and insects that the birds prey on,"" Lennox Kirao, a research scientist with conservation group A Rocha Kenya, said. They also damage crops, livestock and chickens. ""They pounce on chicks and eat them like madmen. These are not normal birds, they act wildly,"" said Eunice Katana, a resident of Takaye village in Kilifi county. They are also known to use a unique sound to communicate distress - or when they spot a prey, according to Mr Kirao. The birds have defaced houses in Mombasa by defecating on the walls and roofs, while many people shy away from sitting under tree shades for fear of being dirtied by their droppings. ""These crows rise early and interrupt our sleep with their annoying squeals and cawing,"" Mombasa resident Victor Kimuli told the BBC. Given all these issues the authorities felt they had to act and aim to halve the Indian house crow population through poisoning, which began on Tuesday. This follows months of consultations with environmental experts, conservationists, community leaders and representatives from the hotel industry, the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) said. ""We are trying to get their population down to a controllable number,"" said Mr Kirao. The culling process involves months of pre-baiting - where the birds are encouraged, through leaving meat out, to gather at various places near their roost sites. ""We then poison them after pulling together the highest number in the baiting sites,"" Eric Kinoti, an official from the A Rocha Kenya, said. An avian poison called Starlicide is so far the only known substance that has proved effective in reducing crow numbers, without affecting other birds or animals. Close to 2,000 crows were killed in 2022 during efficacy tests carried out on the poison by Little Kenya Gardens, the company licensed to import the poison, Cecilia Ruto, owner of the firm, said. ""The slow-acting poison is entirely metabolised by the crow before it dies – which means, there is little risk of secondary poisoning to any other species that feeds on the dead crow,"" Ms Ruto added. There are currently 2kg (4.4lb) of the poison in the country which is estimated to be able to kill about 20,000 crows in the ongoing eradication. But there are plans to import more from New Zealand. Its use in Kenya has, however, raised ethical concerns from animal and bird rights activists, who argue that poisoning the crows is inhumane and that alternative and non-lethal methods should be explored. “Mass poisoning is a short-term solution that does not address the root cause of the problem,” said Leonard Onyango, an environmentalist. “There is a need to look at sustainable, humane approaches to manage the crow population,” he added. But those involved in the programme emphasise the need to protect native species and ensure ecological balance. “If we do nothing now, the damage could become irreversible,” said Mr Kirao, who is involved in the culling programme. This is not the first time the government has initiated plans to control invasive bird species. The previous attempt more than 20 years ago reduced the bird population, but the government later banned the importation of Starlicide in an effort to regulate what was coming into the country. Apart from dump sites, tourist hotels have become the crows’ favourite haunt, where they flock dining areas, disrupting guests as they enjoy their meals, hotel owners have complained. “The crows have really become a big bother to guests who visit our hotels to enjoy their meals outside the tropical beaches,"" Maureen Awuor, the Kenya Association of Hotelkeepers and Caterers chairperson, said. Some hotels trap and suffocate the crows, while others have hired staff with catapults to scare them. But trapping is said to be ineffective as the birds are intelligent enough to avoid areas where they witness other crows dying or being trapped. Despite the huge numbers which are planned to be culled, the authorities feel that they have no choice, especially now that there are concerns that the crows could spread inland. The birds have been spotted in the Mtito Andei area - about 240km (150 miles) from the capital, Nairobi, conservationists say. ""My biggest fear is, if we don't do anything now, the crows will reach Nairobi. This will pose a great threat to birdlife in the country, especially at the Nairobi National Park,"" Mr Kirao said.

2,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-03 05:36:43.000,Why the world's anti-doping agency feels stuck between US and China,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2gygj1d28o,2024-08-01 00:53:05.000,"The World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) says it is ""unfairly caught"" in a row between the US and China, with their geopolitical tensions spilling onto the Olympic stage. China's top swimmers have been in the spotlight after a slew of doping allegations, followed by contentious US claims that Wada was covering it up. Chinese swimmers headed to Paris were drug-tested twice as much as some other nations, which, in turn, has fuelled accusations of a conspiracy to disrupt their performance. Wada said in its statement on Tuesday that it had been caught in ""the middle of geopolitical tensions between superpowers but has no mandate to participate in that"". ""Certain individuals [in the US] are attempting to score political points purely on the basis that the athletes in question are Chinese,"" Wada head of media relations James Fitzgerald told the BBC. ""The result is that it has created distrust and division within the anti-doping system."" A trade war, geopolitical rivalries and Beijing's friendship with Russia have soured relations between the world's two largest economies. It's little surprise that some of those tensions play out in competitive sports but now they appear to be driving a harder - and harsher - wedge. Last week, Wada had said it was considering legal action against its US counterpart, Usada, over ""defamatory"" accusations. The latter had accused Wada and China's anti-doping agency, Chinada, of being among the ""dirty hands in burying positive tests and suppressing the voices of courageous whistleblowers"". US lawmakers, too, have accused Wada of failing to investigate doping allegations against Chinese swimmers properly. And on Tuesday they introduced a bill that would give the White House power to cut funding to the agency. ""When members of congress and senators are inserting themselves into the largely technical world of anti-doping, it ceases to be about scientific and legal analysis, and it drifts into the political realm,"" said Mr Fitzgerald. Wada's statement on Tuesday followed reports in the New York Times about a previously undisclosed case involving two Chinese swimmers - including one on this year’s Olympic team - who were investigated for doping. They had tested positive for a banned steroid in 2022, but they were cleared to compete. China's anti-doping agency concluded that the athletes had most likely consumed the steroid unknowingly while eating contaminated burgers. Usada accused Wada of letting China ""compete under a different set of rules, tilting the field in their favour"". But Wada defended the decision. It said the athletes’ nutritional supplements and hair tests had returned negative results, and that both swimmers also provided control samples that were negative in the days before and after the one test that was positive. It added that the two swimmers were suspended for more than a year and then their cases were closed. Their cases are part of a ""wider series of cases involving [Chinese] athletes from different sports"", the agency said, adding that, ""based on the number of cases, clearly there is an issue of contamination in several countries around the world"". In a statement in June, Wada noted that athletes who eat meat sometimes test positive for drugs if they have ingested clenbuterol, a banned substance which is used as a growth promoter for farm animals. That statement, in response to questions from the New York Times, said the agency was investigating instances of contamination in China as well as Mexico, Guatemala and other countries. The agency's boss Olivier Niggli pointed out at the time that US media had ""only asked questions about China when meat contamination is an issue in many countries"", and referred to ""attempts to politicise anti-doping"". All of this follows a bigger controversy in April, when the New York Times reported that 23 Chinese swimmers had tested positive for a performance-enhancing drug months before the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. But they were cleared to compete after Chinese officials found the results were caused by contamination. The 30-member team went on to win six medals, inlcuding three golds in Tokyo. Eleven of those who tested positive were also picked to be part of the Chinese swimming team for the Paris Olympics. US swimmer and 11-time Olympic medalist Katie Ledecky had said her confidence in anti-doping regulators was at an ""all-time low"" after the news about the 23 Chinese swimmers. Wada's investigation, however, found that it was ""not in a position to disprove the possibility that contamination"" was the source of the drug, heart medication trimetazidine (TMZ). It said the contamination theory was supported by ""the combination of the consistently low concentrations of TMZ as well as no doping pattern"" among the tested athletes. That is, their test results over several days were not consistent, veering between negative and positive. An independent investigation found that Wada did not mishandle the case or show bias towards the Chinese swimmers. The scandals upped the pressure on anti-doping officals and by the time the Chinese swimming team arrived in Paris, they were being tested far more than is standard. Since January, each of the team's 31 members have been tested, on average, 21 times by various anti-doping organisations, according to World Aquatics, which oversees water sports. In comparison, Australia's 41 swimmers have been tested an average of four times and the 46 US swimmers, an average of six times. The flurry of tests has sparked another set of allegations. The state-run Chinese newspaper the Global Times blames Western powers for ""abusing doping tests to disrupt [the] Chinese swimming team"". Speaking to the Global Times, an international politics professor in Shanghai, accused the US of dominating anti-doping rules. Shen Yi suggested that the ""relentless and unethical testing"" had disrupted the Chinese team's training, which she called a ""disgrace to the Olympics"". Chinese swimmer Qin Haiyang, who holds the world record for the 200m men's breastroke, said this testing ""proves that European and American teams feel threatened by the performances of the Chinese team in recent years"". ""Some tricks aim to disrupt our preparation rhythm and destroy our psychological defence. But we are not afraid,"" he said on Chinese social media platform Weibo. Qin, who won golds in the 50m, 100m and 200m breaststroke at the world championships last year, finished in seventh place in the men's 100m breaststroke final on Sunday. This criticism was echoed by former Chinese diving champion Gao Min who said the rigorous testing had ""disrupted our Chinese swimming team"" and called Qin's performance ""the worst in any competition over the past two years”. China's current medal tally stands at one gold, two silver and two bronze. China's “butterfly queen”, Zhang Yufei, who won a silver in the 100m event in Tokyo, was in tears over her bronze finish on Monday but said the doping tests did not have a big impact on her. While they were a ""bit annoying"", she said it was the pressure that was ""far greater"" than she had imagined.

2,2024-08-03 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-03 05:36:43.000,How a refugee Olympian found a new life in Canada,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crg4vr7kyq5o,2024-07-31 23:07:53.000,"Nigara Shaheen’s journey to becoming an Olympic judoka did not begin with judo. Instead, it began with a 30-minute karate lesson on her family’s balcony in Peshawar, Pakistan. She was 11 years old and had already been a refugee for most of her young life, having fled her native Afghanistan in 1993 with her parents as an infant, her mother carrying her as they walked two days and nights through the mountains to safety. She has faced many more obstacles to fight in the sport she loves, in between her first-ever karate lesson and competing in the Paris Olympics as part of the Refugee Olympic Team. Since 2022, the 31-year-old athlete has been living and training in Toronto. As a young student in Pakistan, Ms Shaheen faced harassment by older men on her way to the refugee school she attended, and bullying by her peers. In an essay in the Toronto Life magazine, she recalled: ""One day, an older man assaulted me and my sister. He screamed at us and pushed me to the ground. I wanted to punch and beat him, but I didn’t know how."" Her mother said she needed to learn how to defend herself. The school she attended didn't offer martial arts or other after-school activities for students - even if it had, it would often close, sometimes for weeks at a time, she told the BBC in an interview from Paris. But through her extended family, she heard about an instructor who was coaching karate at a nearby school. He couldn't train her there, but he could come to her. Soon after, Ms Shaheen was on the balcony at her aunt's home, getting coached. Her mother told her the balcony was all the family had to offer “but you can use it as much as you want”, she recalled. Not long after, Ms Shaheen was fighting in local karate tournaments. Her coach, noticing her talent and passion, suggested she try competing in judo. “I asked him ‘what’s judo? And how would I know what to do?’ He told me: ‘Just grab your opponent and throw her, that’s it,’” she said. Ms Shaheen was able to take down her first opponent in a few seconds. She had a knack for the sport. While winning felt good, it was the philosophy of judo that got her hooked. “(My first coach) said you will not learn how to get up unless you fall. As a kid, that really motivated me,” she said. It also reminded her of watching the WWE with her father, a wrestling fan, as a child. The sport gave her the confidence to find herself - and joy in her life - despite the hardships she faced as a refugee. Ms Shaheen’s coaches began to notice her talent. At one point she trained with Pakistan’s national judo team but could not compete alongside them without a Pakistani passport. In 2014, Ms Shaheen returned to Afghanistan, where she studied political science and public administration at the American University in Kabul. She also trained with the Afghani national team, were she was welcomed by her male colleagues. ""Inside the gym, we were a family, and they treated me like I was their sister,"" she wrote in Toronto Life. She continued to train and compete, and began to receive a lot of attention as a female athlete in Afghanistan - some of it unwanted. “I faced immense cyber bullying,” she told the BBC. The harassment later turned physical. “There were so many times when cars would chase us,” she said. Once, someone threw a soft drink can in her mother’s direction as she was dropping her off at practice. She left her home country again, in 2018. “I always say that I became a refugee for a second time,” she said. She moved to Russia for her master’s studies in international trade and entrepreneurship. But unlike the welcome she received at her gym in Afghanistan, she couldn't find a training partner in Russia. She spent the next year training alone - a time she has called ""the worst days"" of her career. In 2019, she was approached by an International Judo Federation member, who suggested she try out for the Refugee Olympic Team. She qualified for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, but a serious shoulder injury knocked her out of the competition. By then she had finished her studies in Russia and the situation in Afghanistan had deteriorated drastically. “I was just stuck,” Ms Shaheen said. She returned to Pakistan where she mostly stayed at home in fear of her safety - she had faced criticism for not wearing a headscarf during the Games - and contemplated her next steps. That’s when the opportunity to live and train in Canada opened up, with the help of the Olympic Refugee Foundation and United Nations Refugee Agency. Ms Shaheen was accepted to study in Toronto for a postgraduate degree in international development. She arrived in September 2022 - a bittersweet moment for the athlete who had already journeyed through three countries in search of stability. It was in that Canadian city where her judo career was given a new lease on life. “I was so happy to finally be at a place where I can be myself,” she said. “But it was also hard for me because I had to say goodbye to my parents for the second time.” In Paris, she is one of the 37 athletes playing for the Refugee Olympic Team - a team Ms Shaheen is grateful to be a part of. “I feel really proud,” she said ahead of her first competition on Tuesday against Mexico’s Prisca Awiti Alcaraz. “I’m as much of an Afghan as I am a refugee,” she said. The banner for the refugee team is “a flag that I can relate to”. While she lost to Ms Alcaraz, Ms Shaheen has said that she is thankful to be able to compete at the highest level. ""Even with every loss, I learn something new."" She will appear on the mat once again on Saturday, where she will represent the Refugee Olympic Team in the mixed team event - her first time doing so. ""Team events are more exciting since I always look at my teammates and feel like I can’t let them down so I fight for all of them,"" she told the International Judo Federation ahead of the competition. After the games, Ms Shaheen plans to call Canada home - she is now a permanent resident - and she hopes to one day work to assist refugees like herself. Her parents are still in Pakistan, where they are cheering her on as she lives out her Olympic dream. At her lowest points, she said she would lean on her family for support. “My sister used to tell me, ‘I trust that one day you will achieve something big, and this will be a memory and you will laugh about this.’” “Now is the time that I laugh about it.” Our guide to what sports you can expect to watch and when on the BBC on Tuesday. Angela Carini says she ""wants to apologise"" to Algerian boxer Imane Khelif after there was no handshake at the end of their Olympic fight.

1,2024-08-04 07:36:36.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-04 05:09:50.000,Markets digest bank earnings after recent turmoil,https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/stock-market-bank-earnings/index.html,2023-04-14 20:00:28.000,"Our live coverage for the day has ended. Follow the latest business news here or read through the updates below. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm, slashed Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink’s pay by 30% to $25.2 million for 2022, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The move comes after the money manager reported first-quarter revenue that was down 10% from a year ago, as rising interest rates and economic uncertainty impacted the firm’s bottom line. “With respect to 2022 compensation, management determined to reduce the impact of the firm’s decline in profitability on BlackRock’s broader employee population by concentrating the downward adjustments to total incentive awards toward senior management,” the filing said. Total compensation for Fink, 70, included a base salary of $1.5 million and $23.7 million in total incentive awards. Several other executives saw their compensation reduced, including Rob Kapito, the firm’s president, whose package shrank by 34% to $18.95 million. UBS’ purchase of Credit Suisse’s US subsidiaries can move forward, the Federal Reserve said Friday. The statement comes a month after UBS stepped in to rescue the embattled Swiss lender and prevent turmoil in the financial sector from spreading, after an emergency loan of nearly $54 billion from the Swiss National Bank failed to stop the carnage. The problems for Credit Suisse began when the Saudi National Bank, its largest backer, said it wouldn’t put up more cash after buying a nearly 10% stake in the bank for $1.5 billion in 2022. Banking customers were already on edge after the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank — so Credit Suisse shares tumbled more than 25% and saw billions of dollars of outflows. The global turmoil has led US lawmakers to call for tighter regulations on banks. The Fed board said UBS will provide a quarterly updated plan for combining UBS’s and Credit Suisse’s US business and operations. “The implementation plan will address UBS’s obligations to comply with more stringent enhanced prudential standards, including liquidity standards,” the Fed said in a statement. UBS is shelling out 3 billion Swiss francs, or $3.25 billion, for Credit Suisse. Stocks slid Friday after a slate of earnings beats from big banks fueled concerns that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its next two meetings. Still, the major indices gained for the week. The Dow rose 400 points, or 1.2%. The S&P 500 gained 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.3%. JPMorgan Chase on Friday reported first-quarter profit and revenue that crushed expectations, boosted by the Fed’s interest rate hiking campaign. Citigroup, Wells Fargo and PNC Financial also reported strong results. CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors in the company’s post-earnings conference call that they should prepare for interest rates to be higher for longer than expected. Wall Street seems to have taken note. Analysts increased their bets on a quarter-point rate hike at the Fed’s meeting in May and another in June. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Friday that the central bank needs to continue tightening monetary policy, further weighing down markets. Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said that it’s “definitely” possible the United States enters a mild recession after the tumult in banking last month. Meanwhile, retail sales data declined more than expected, suggesting that Americans’ spending power and the US economy are weakening. Consumer sentiment held fairly steady in April, even as concerns about a recession linger, according to the University of Michigan’s latest monthly survey. “There was too much news to digest this morning, but the key takeaway is that the Fed has room to do more harm,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, said in a note. The Dow slipped 144 points, or 0.4%. The S&P 500 tumbled 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite sank 0.4%. As stocks settle after the trading day, levels might still change slightly. Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said Friday he isn’t discounting the recent assessment from central bank economists that the banking crisis will tip the United States into a mild recession later this year. “There’s no way you can look at current conditions around the world and in the US and not think that some mild recession is definitely on the table as a possibility,” Goolsbee said Friday during an interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” He added that, when viewed historically, the monetary tightening campaign undertaken by the Fed — hiking interest rates nine times in just over a year — is expected to slow GDP growth. “When you get numbers like retail sales and others that are declining, if you look at construction, I think we’ve got to think about what’s the state of growth in the country,” he said. “Fortunately, the labor market continues to be very strong.” Critics have lambasted the World Bank and, particularly, the International Monetary Fund, for predicting Russia’s economy would hold relatively stable this year despite international sanctions. But sanctions are hurting Russia’s economy, even if World Bank forecasts don’t reflect it, according to the outgoing World Bank President David Malpass. Speaking to Julia Chatterley at the IMF-World Bank spring conference, David Malpass responded to criticism that you couldn’t trust GDP and economic data from Russia. He admitted “the quality of the data differs substantially by country…the reality is there’s not very much in terms of double checking of data”. In January, the IMF projected that Russia’s economy would expand by 0.3% this year and 2.1% the next. That was much more optimistic than the latest forecasts from the World Bank, which still penciled in a contraction of just 3.3% this year. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development was the most pessimistic, forecasting a 5.6% contraction in Russia’s economy in 2023. Malpass said that GDP numbers were not capturing the “reality” and “horror” of the war, and noted the Russian economy was suffering. “I think life is hard in Russia…they’re excluded from travelling to many parts of the world, their supply chains have to change dramatically… young people moving out because they don’t want to be part of this war,” Malpass said. Consumer sentiment tracked by the University of Michigan held steady in April, according to a preliminary reading released Friday. So far, the university’s monthly surveys have shown a limited impact from the banking crisis on consumers’ attitudes, but Americans remain concerned about an upcoming recession and some lingering fears about inflation persist. “Consumers are expecting a downturn, they’re not feeling as dismal as they were last summer, but they’re waiting for the other shoe to drop,” said Joanne Hsu, director of the surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan, in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Friday morning. “We now have about a month of data following the collapse of SVB, and there hasn’t really been much of an effect on sentiment at all,” she said. The latest survey also showed that higher gas prices helped push up year-ahead inflation expectations by a full percentage point, rising from 3.6% in March to 4.6% in April. “Consumers are still feeling the pain of high prices,” Hsu told Bloomberg, noting that survey respondents were now mentioning gas prices for the first time since fall. The latest cooldown in consumer and producer price hikes as well as the latest decline in retail sales are indications that the Federal Reserve’s efforts are working to bring down high inflation, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee told CNBC on Friday. “You don’t want to overreact to short-run news, but it feel likes like that’s moving in the right direction,” he said during an appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” Goolsbee was quick to note that an area of critical importance to him in advance of the next Fed meeting is activity in banking and credit. Earlier this week, Goolsbee noted that the Fed needs to be “on watch” for tighter credit conditions as a result of the banking turmoil last month. He referenced private sector analyst estimates that the spillover effects of the crisis equate to the Fed enacting rate hikes anywhere from a quarter point to three-quarters of a point. “I’m an old-school data dog,” Goolsbee said Friday. “What I would do is spend the next three weeks getting out and figuring out how much credit tightening is coming.” Chief executives at some of the largest banks in the United States were forced to address the elephant in the room as they reported first-quarter earnings on Friday morning: The regional banking crisis that brought Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank to ruin last month. > Banking industry turmoil has added to risks of recessionary “storm clouds” on the horizon, said JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon Friday in a release. He added that “the banking situation is distinct from 2008 as it has involved far fewer financial players and fewer issues that need to be resolved.” Still, said Dimon, who leads the country’s largest bank, “financial conditions will likely tighten as lenders become more conservative, and we do not know if this will slow consumer spending.” >“We are glad to have been in a strong position to help support the US financial system during the recent events that impacted the banking industry,” commented Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf in a statement. “Regional and community banks are an important part of our financial system and are uniquely positioned to serve their customers and communities.” > “I believe today’s crisis of confidence in the regional banking sector will further accelerate capital markets growth, and BlackRock will be a central player,” wrote BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on Friday. “Increased financing through the capital markets will require the scale, multi-asset capabilities and excellence in portfolio construction that BlackRock consistently delivers across market cycles,” he said in a statement. That means bad news for regional banks could be good news for BlackRock – the lack of trust in regional banks will drive more investment into capital markets and BlackRock is poised to benefit as that happens. “Throughout our history, moments of market dislocation and disruption have served as inflection points for BlackRock,” he explained. Regulators also hired BlackRock in early April to help the US government in the sale of the $114 billion in assets it collected from the collapse> Citigroup and PNC did not address the banking crisis in their releases, but will likely answer questions about how they’ve weathered the turmoil and what they see ahead at their first-quarter presentations, planned for 11 a.m. ET. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors Friday not to be caught unawares if interest rates stay higher longer than expected. “People need to be prepared. They shouldn’t pray that they don’t go up. They should prepare for them going up. And if it doesn’t happen, serendipity,” Dimon said on the company’s post-earnings conference call. High interest rates have helped big banks, including JPMorgan Chase, since they widen the gap between the interest paid to customers and what they earn from investing that money. But climbing rates also helped drive last month’s collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which held 55% of its customers deposits in long-dated bonds whose value diminished as interest rates rose. Dimon stated that he believes the banking crisis will pass — even though he expects its effects to reverberate through the sector for years to come — but that the possibility of higher interest rates should remain on companies’ radars. “If and when that happens, it will address problems in the economy. For those who are too exposed to floating rates, or those who are too exposed to [refinancing] risk, those exposures will be in multiple parts of the economy,” Dimon said. “Now would be the time to fix it. Do not put yourself in a position where that risk is excessive for your company, your business, your investment pools,” he said. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the largest US bank, told investors Friday that he isn’t too worried about a credit crunch resulting from the recent banking crisis. “I wouldn’t use the word[s] ‘credit crunch,’” he said in response to a question about whether he was worried that lending would tighten in the bank after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. There will be “a little bit of tightening,” said Dimon, but that will mostly be contained within the real estate market. Dimon added that he’s more worried about recession than a credit crunch. “I just look at it as a kind of a thumb on the scale. It just makes the financing conditions a little bit tighter and increases the odds of a recession,” he said. “That’s what that is. It’s not like a credit crunch.” JPMorgan Chase said Friday its exposure to the office sector is limited, addressing concerns about the commercial real estate industry’s stability. “Given the recent focus on commercial real estate, let me remind you that our office sector exposure is less than 10% of our portfolio and is focused in urban dense markets, and nearly two-thirds of our loans are multifamily, primarily in supply-constrained markets,” said Jeremy Barnum, chief financial officer, in the company’s post-earnings conference call. Investors and regulators are watching the $20 trillion US commercial real estate market for signs that it could be the next shoe to drop after the banking tumult last month. That’s partly because the value of buildings is going down, particularly as offices in major cities remain vacant or half-empty as Americans opt to work from home. The commercial real estate industry’s woes come after decades of unbridled growth powered by low interest rates and easy credit. That upward trend was interrupted by the Covid pandemic’s onset, and then when the Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates aggressively last year to stabilize the economy. “There are obviously some big things here and there to pay attention to, but in the scheme of things for us, not a big issue,” Barnum said. Spending at US retailers fell in March as consumers pulled back amid recessionary fears fueled by the banking crisis. Retail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation, fell by 1% in March from the prior month, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. That was steeper than an expected 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv, and above the revised 0.2% decline in the prior month. The drop was driven by a pullback in spending at department stores and on durable goods such as appliances and furniture. Spending at general merchandise stores fell 3% in March from the prior month and spending at gas stations declined 5.5% during the same period. Excluding gas station sales, retail spending retreated 0.6% in March from February. However, year-on-year retail spending rose 2.9%. Citigroup shares were up about 0.8% in premarket trading after the bank posted strong first-quarter profits, beating analyst expectations for both earnings per share and revenue. The bank brought in $21.4 billion in revenue versus expectations of $19.9 billion. Earnings per share were $2.19, estimates were for $1.67. Citi CEO Jane Fraser and CFO Mark Mason will hold an earnings presentation at 11 a.m. ET. Stocks slid Friday, even as big banks reported beats on their first-quarter earnings in an auspicious start to earnings season. Investors were watching for clues about the financial sector’s stability, and whether the tumult in the sector last month could lead to tighter lending standards. A key point of interest was also how much big banks benefitted from increased deposit inflows when nervous customers fled from regional banks after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. JPMorgan, the largest bank in the United States and an economic bellwether, posted record revenue. Wells Fargo, Citigroup and PNC Financial Services also reported earnings beats. Shares of JPMorgan Chase gained 4.8%, Wells Fargo rose 0.7%, Citigroup added 1.9% and PNC Financial Services ticked up 0.3%. Meanwhile, retail sales came in weaker than expected as recession fears loom. Retail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation, fell by 1% in March from the month before, according to the Commerce Department. Economists expected a 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv. The Dow fell 38 points, or about 0.1%. The S&P 500 sank 0.1%. The Nasdaq Composite declined 0.5%. The Federal Reserve could end its historic rate-hiking campaign after just one more quarter-point increase, said Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic in a Thursday interview with Reuters. The Fed has approved nine rate hikes in a row since last March, the effects of which are only now starting to “bite,” Bostic said. Monetary policy can take months to trickle through the economy, but a slew of recent data suggests that inflation is finally cooling. The March Consumer Price Index shows price hikes have slowed for nine months in a row, and headline wholesale inflation reflected in the Producer Price Index has sunk to 2.7% after reaching double digit highs last year. Bostic said the recent “chaos” in the banking sector, after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, persuaded him to rethink the pace of rate hikes. However, he told Reuters he believes the turmoil will not have any lasting impact on the the US economy. Analysts expect the Fed to raise rates by a quarter point at its upcoming policy meeting on May 2-3, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Regional bank PNC Financial reported first-quarter revenue of $5.6 billion and earnings per share of $3.98 vs. expectations of $3.66. Shares rose 5% on the news. Wells Fargo reported first-quarter revenue of $20.7 billion against expectations of $20.1 billion. The San Francisco-based bank saw earnings of $4.9 billion, up from $3.8 billion a year earlier, an increase of about 32%. Shares of Wells Fargo rose 2.2%. JPMorgan Chase on Friday reported first-quarter profit and revenue that roundly beat expectations, boosted by a year of rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. The New York-based bank posted a profit of $12.6 billion or $4.10 per share. That’s up from $8.3 billion, or $2.63 per share from the same period a year before. Analysts expected earnings of $3.41 per share, according to Refinitiv. With $3.67 trillion in assets, JPMorgan Chase is the largest bank in the United States and a bellwether for the US economy. “The US economy continues to be on generally healthy footings — consumers are still spending and have strong balance sheets, and businesses are in good shape. However, the storm clouds that we have been monitoring for the past year remain on the horizon,” CEO Jamie Dimon said in a press release. Net interest income rose to $20.8 billion, up 49% from the prior year, driven by the aggressive interest rate campaign the Fed kicked off last year to stabilize prices. Deposits rose to $2.38 trillion during the first quarter from $2.34 trillion in the quarter ended in December. That comes after the banking tumult last month triggered a rush into big banks from nervous customers. Investors also looked to money market funds as a haven. A key point of conversation after last month’s turmoil in the banking sector has been whether banks could tighten lending standards, leading customers to spend less as it becomes more difficult to borrow money for large purchases like homes and cars. “Financial conditions will likely tighten as lenders become more conservative, and we do not know if this will slow consumer spending,” Dimon said, adding that JPMorgan Chase is “confident that we can serve the needs of our customers and clients in all environments.” Shares of JPMorgan Chase climbed 6.1% in pre-market trading. The company’s post-earnings conference call is slated for 8:30 a.m. ET. Stocks: US stock futures fell ahead of several bank earnings this morning. Investors also fretted a retail sales report that is expected to show consumers are pulling back on their spending. Dow futures were down 75 points, or 0.2%. S&P 500 futures fell 0.2%. Nasdaq futures were 0.4% lower. European stocks were higher and Asian stocks closed up. Fear & Greed Index: 67 = Greed Oil & gas: US oil prices were up 0.3% to $82 a barrel. Average US gas prices rose to $3.66 a gallon. Wall Street is searching for answers to two key questions: Is the economy headed for a recession? And, if so, who’s poised to weather it? Recession fears have ramped up in recent weeks after the banking tumult last month raised concerns about the financial sector’s health. Earnings season for banks starts on Friday with JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, BlackRock, Citigroup and PNC Financial Services slated to report before the bell. Investors will be watching for clues about stability. Stocks have yet to price in the economy’s precarious position, with the S&P 500 adding about 7% this year. But markets have already seen volatile trading since then. “We’re going to see a correction happen here, because it just never makes sense when the market’s going up and earnings are going down,” says Eric Sterner, chief investment officer at Apollon Wealth Management. But while earnings are an undeniable factor driving markets, inflation remains a key concern. Wall Street remains overly optimistic that the Fed will cut rates later this year — even after officials indicated last month that they likely won’t — or that it could even orchestrate a soft landing. That hope, and the market’s resilience, could start to crumble in the next few weeks, said Megan Horneman, chief investment officer at Verdence Capital Advisors. “You very well could see that catalyst over the next couple of weeks with earnings, and then this inflation data and then what the Fed says when they meet,” said Horneman. Jeremy Grantham made his name predicting the dot-com crash in 2000 and the financial crisis in 2008. Now, the famous investor warns another epic bubble in financial markets is bursting — and the turmoil that swept through the banking sector last month is just the beginning. “Other things will break, and who knows what they will be,” Grantham told CNN in an exclusive interview. “We’re by no means finished with the stress to the financial system.” Since early 2022, when the S&P 500 hit an all-time high, US stocks have dropped about 15% as central banks have jacked up borrowing costs. But Grantham sees much steeper declines on the horizon. The “best we can hope for,” he said, is a fall of about 27% from current levels, while the worst-case scenario would see a plunge of more than 50%. The low point might not arrive until “deep into next year,” he added. Grantham sees uncomfortable parallels between markets today and 2000, when an explosion in the price of tech stocks was followed by a dizzying crash. There are also echoes of 2008, when a painful comedown in the US housing market almost broke the banking system. What’s even more worrying is that this time, bubbles in the stock market and the real estate market are poised to burst simultaneously, Grantham said. The broader US banking system remains sound and stable, but the two regional banks that failed were “poorly managed” and “took unacceptable risks,” White House economic adviser Lael Brainard told CNN’s Poppy Harlow in an interview Wednesday at Semafor’s World Economy Summit in Washington, DC. Last month’s collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank roiled markets and spread fear through the economy of a possible wider banking crisis. The US Treasury, Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation all intervened to ensure bank customers could access all their money and to attempt to stave off future bank runs. “The banking system, it’s very sound, it’s stable; the core of the banking system has a great deal of capital that was put in place in the wake of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis,” said Brainard, director of the White House National Economic Council. “There were some banks who were not managing their risks effectively. They failed, and the president took strong actions along with the Secretary of the Treasury and the banking regulators,” she said. “Those actions reassured Americans their deposits are safe, the banking system is sound; but it was also important to the president that the executives of those failed banks were held accountable and, very important, that taxpayer money not be at risk,” she continued. Before its collapse last month, Silicon Valley Bank was known to investors of color as a place that fostered a community of minority entrepreneurs and provided them with both social and financial capital. SVB regularly sponsored conferences and networking events for minority entrepreneurs, and it was well known for funding the annual State of Black Venture Report spearheaded by BLK VC, a nonprofit organization that connects and empowers Black investors. “When other banks were saying no, SVB would say yes,” said Joynicole Martinez, a 25-year entrepreneur and chief advancement and innovation officer for Rising Tide Capital, a nonprofit organization founded in 2004 to connect entrepreneurs with investors and mentors. Minority business owners have long faced challenges accessing capital due to discriminatory lending practices, experts say. Data from the Small Business Credit Survey, a collaboration of all 12 Federal Reserve banks, shows disparities on denial rates for bank and nonbank loans. In 2021, about 16% of Black-led companies acquired the total amount of business financing they sought from banks, compared to 35% of White-owned companies, the survey shows. “We know there’s historic, systemic, and just blatant racism that’s inherent in lending and banking. We have to start there and not tip-toe around it,” Martinez told CNN. The Financial Services Forum, an organization representing the eight largest financial institutions in the United States has said banks have committed millions of dollars since 2020 to address economic and racial inequality.

1,2024-08-04 07:36:36.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-04 05:09:50.000,Still haven't filed your taxes? Here's what you need to know,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/13/success/tax-filing-tips/index.html,2023-04-14 20:07:40.000,"Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks So far this tax season, the IRS has received more than 100 million income tax returns for 2022. That means tens of millions of households have yet to file their returns. If yours is among them, here are some last-minute tax-filing tips to keep in mind as the Tuesday, April 18 deadline approaches. Not everyone has to file on April 18: If you live in a federally declared disaster area, have a business there — or have relevant tax documents stored by businesses in that area — it’s likely the IRS has already extended the filing and payment deadlines for you. Here is where you can find the specific extension dates for each disaster area. Thanks to many rounds of extreme weather in recent months, for instance, tax filers in most of California — which accounts for 10% to 15% of all federal filers — have already been granted an extension until Oct. 16 to file and to pay, according to an IRS spokesperson. If you’re in the armed forces and are currently or were recently stationed in a combat zone, the filing and payment deadlines for your 2022 taxes are most likely extended by 180 days. But your specific extended filing and payment deadlines will depend on the day you leave (or left) the combat zone. This IRS publication offers more detail. Taxes and adulting: What to know about filing taxes on your own for the first time Lastly, if you made little to no money last year (typically less than $12,950 for single filers and $25,900 for married couples), you may not be required to file a return. But you may want to anyway if you think you are eligible for a refund thanks to, for instance, refundable tax credits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit. (Use this IRS tool to gauge whether you are required to file this year.) You also are likely eligible to use IRS Free File (intended for those with adjusted gross income of $73,000 or less) so it won’t cost you to submit a return. Your paycheck may not be your only source of income: If you had one full-time job you may think that is the only income you made and have to report. But that’s not necessarily so. Other potentially taxable and reportable income sources include: Organize your tax documents: By now you should have received every tax document that third parties are required to send you (your employer, bank, brokerage, etc.). If you don’t recall receiving a hard copy of a tax form in the mail, check your email and your online accounts — a document may have been sent to you electronically. Here are some of the tax forms you may have received: “Be aware that there’s no form for some taxable income, like proceeds from renting out your vacation property, meaning you’re responsible for reporting it on your own,” according to the Illinois CPA Society. One very last-minute way to reduce your 2022 tax bill: If you’re eligible to make a tax-deductible contribution to an IRA and haven’t done so for last year, you have until April 18 to contribute up to $6,000 ($7,000 if you’re 50 or older). That will reduce your tax bill and augment your retirement savings. Proofread your return before submitting it: Do this whether you’re using tax software or working with a professional tax preparer. Little mistakes and oversights delay the processing of your return (and the issuance of your refund if you’re owed one). You want to avoid things like having a typo in your name, birth date, Social Security number or direct deposit number; choosing the wrong filing status (e.g., married vs single); making a simple math error; or leaving a required field blank. What to do if you can’t file by April 18: If you’re not able to file by next Tuesday, fill out Form 4868 electronically or on paper and send it in by April 18. You will be granted an automatic six-month extension to file. Your tax refund may be smaller this year. Here's why Note, however, that an extension to file is not an extension to pay. You will be charged interest (currently running at 7%) and a penalty on any amount you still owe for 2022 but haven’t paid by April 18. So if you suspect you still owe tax — perhaps you had some income outside of your job for which tax wasn’t withheld or you had a big capital gain last year — approximate how much more you owe and send that money to the IRS by Tuesday. You can choose to do so by mail, attaching a check to your extension request form. Make sure your envelope is postmarked no later than April 18. Or the more efficient route is pay what you owe electronically at IRS.gov, said CPA Damien Martin, a tax partner at EY. If you do that, the IRS notes you will not have to file a Form 4868. “The IRS will automatically process an extension of time to file,” the agency notes in its instructions. If you opt to electronically pay directly from your bank account, which is free, select “extension” and then “tax year 2022” when given the option. You can also pay by credit or debit card, but you will be charged a processing fee. Doing so, though, may become much more costly than just a fee if you charge your tax payment but don’t pay your credit card bill off in full every month, since you likely pay a high interest rate on outstanding balances. If you still owe income taxes to your state, remember that you may need to go through a similar exercise of filing for an extension and making a payment to your state’s revenue department, Martin said.

1,2024-08-04 07:36:36.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-04 05:09:50.000,Retail spending fell in March as consumers pull back,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/14/economy/march-retail-sales/index.html,2023-04-14 14:29:52.000,"Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Spending at US retailers fell in March as consumers pulled back after the banking crisis fueled recession fears. Retail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation, fell by 1% in March from the prior month, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. That was steeper than an expected 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv, and above the revised 0.2% decline in the prior month. Investors chalk up some of the weakness to a lack of tax returns and concerns about a slowing labor market. The IRS issued $84 billion in tax refunds this March, about $25 billion less than they issued in March of 2022, according to BofA analysts. That led consumers to pull back in spending at department stores and on durable goods, such as appliances and furniture. Spending at general merchandise stores fell 3% in March from the prior month and spending at gas stations declined 5.5% during the same period. Excluding gas station sales, retail spending retreated 0.6% in March from February. However, retail spending rose 2.9% year-over-year. Smaller tax returns likely played a role in last month’s decline in retail sales, along with the expiration of enhanced food assistance benefits, economists say. “March is a really important month for refunds. Some folks might have been expecting something similar to last year,” Aditya Bhave, senior US economist at BofA Global Research, told CNN. Credit and debit card spending per household tracked by Bank of America researchers moderated in March to its slowest pace in more than two years, which was likely the result of smaller returns and expired benefits, coupled with slowing wage growth. Enhanced pandemic-era benefits provided through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program expired in February, which might have also held back spending in March, according to a Bank of America Institute report. Average hourly earnings grew 4.2% in March from a year earlier, down from the prior month’s annualized 4.6% increase and the smallest annual rise since June 2021, according to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Employment Cost Index, a more comprehensive measure of wages, has also shown that worker pay gains have moderated this past year. ECI data for the first quarter of this year will be released later this month. Still, the US labor market remains solid, even though it has lost momentum recently. That could hold up consumer spending in the coming months, said Michelle Meyer, North America chief economist at Mastercard Economics Institute. “The big picture is still favorable for the consumer when you think about their income growth, their balance sheet and the health of the labor market,” Meyer said. Employers added 236,000 jobs in March, a robust gain by historical standards but smaller than the average monthly pace of job growth in the prior six months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The latest monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, showed that the number of available jobs remained elevated in February — but was down more than 17% from its peak of 12 million in March 2022, and revised data showed that weekly claims for US unemployment benefits were higher than previously reported. The job market could cool further in the coming months. Economists at the Federal Reserve expect the US economy to head into a recession later in the year as the lagged effects of higher interest rates take a deeper hold. Fed economists had forecast subdued growth, with risks of a recession, prior to the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. For consumers, the effects of last month’s turbulence in the banking industry have been limited so far. Consumer sentiment tracked by the University of Michigan worsened slightly in March during the bank failures, but it had already shown signs of deteriorating before then. The latest consumer sentiment reading, released Friday morning, showed that sentiment held steady in April despite the banking crisis, but that higher gas prices helped push up year-ahead inflation expectations by a full percentage point, rising from 3.6% in March to 4.6% in April. “On net, consumers did not perceive material changes in the economic environment in April,” Joanne Hsu, director of the surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan, said in a news release. “Consumers are expecting a downturn, they’re not feeling as dismal as they were last summer, but they’re waiting for the other shoe to drop,” Hsu told Bloomberg TV in an interview Friday morning.

1,2024-08-04 07:36:36.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-04 05:09:50.000,Analysis: Fox News is about to enter the true No Spin Zone,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/14/media/fox-news-dominion-hnk-intl/index.html,2023-04-14 06:41:00.000,"Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks This is it. The media defamation trial of the century is on the precipice of kicking off in Wilmington, Delaware, in just days. Jury selection in Dominion Voting Systems’ monster $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit took place all of Thursday, with 300 potential jurors being summoned to court. Good progress was made and the presiding judge noted that there were “more than enough jurors” to start the trial as scheduled on Monday. It is there, in Courtroom 7E, where the biggest figures in Murdoch Media, accompanied by a throng of high-powered lawyers, will attempt to mount their defense after repeatedly failing to convince a judge to toss the now-historic case. A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. It’s, frankly, extraordinary to write those words. When I watched Fox News broadcast election lies in the aftermath of the 2020 election, never did I expect the network to be held accountable in a meaningful way. I’ve covered Fox News for a while now. I’ve watched thousands and thousands of hours of the right-wing channel’s programming. I’ve seen its hosts over the years undermine public health, make gross anti-immigrant remarks, peddle lies and propaganda and push deranged conspiracy theories that were once reserved for the right-wing’s furthest fringes. The network has always seemed to find a way to sail through the controversy, even the most hellish storms it has faced. Sometimes it has emerged even stronger and more emboldened than before. But this time is different. This time, the normal tricks the network turns to during times of crisis will not free it from trouble. This time, in a court of law, the network will need to put forward an honest, fact-driven argument. Fox News is about to enter the true No Spin Zone, where deception is strictly prohibited. Where it is not in charge. And where its top executives like Rupert Murdoch and Suzanne Scott and hosts like Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity cannot simply ignore a request for comment and resort to, instead, attacking “the media” on-air. In this setting, where lies cannot be casually told and truth cannot be distorted beyond reality to fit a dishonest narrative, it will be fascinating to see how the network fares. If the pre-trial hearings are any indicator, it won’t be pretty. The case hasn’t even started and the presiding judge has already lost his patience with Fox’s legal team and put them on notice. Perhaps the winds will shift for Fox News when the judge gavels in the trial on Monday. But if they play out like the last few weeks of court have, Fox News is in for a brutal ride.

1,2024-08-04 07:36:36.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-04 05:09:50.000,Silicon Valley Bank collapse renews calls to address disparities impacting entrepreneurs of color ,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/13/business/silicon-valley-bank-entrepreneurs-of-color-reaj/index.html,2023-04-13 21:13:04.000,"Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks When customers at Silicon Valley Bank rushed to withdraw billions of dollars last month, venture capitalist Arlan Hamilton stepped in to help some of the founders of color who panicked about losing access to payroll funds. As a Black woman with nearly 10 years of business experience, Hamilton knew the options for those startup founders were limited. SVB had a reputation for servicing people from underrepresented communities like hers. Its failure has reignited concerns from industry experts about lending discrimination in the banking industry and the resulting disparities in capital for people of color. Hamilton, the 43-year-old founder and managing partner of Backstage Capital, said that when it comes to entrepreneurs of color, “we’re already in the smaller house. We already have the rickety door and the thinner walls. And so, when a tornado comes by, we’re going to get hit harder.” Established in 1983, the midsize California tech lender was America’s 16th largest bank at the end of 2022 before it collapsed on March 10. SVB provided banking services to nearly half of all venture-backed technology and life-sciences companies in the United States. Hamilton, industry experts and other investors told CNN the bank was committed to fostering a community of minority entrepreneurs and provided them with both social and financial capital. SVB regularly sponsored conferences and networking events for minority entrepreneurs, said Hamilton, and it was well known for funding the annual State of Black Venture Report spearheaded by BLK VC, a nonprofit organization that connects and empowers Black investors. “When other banks were saying no, SVB would say yes,” said Joynicole Martinez, a 25-year entrepreneur and chief advancement and innovation officer for Rising Tide Capital, a nonprofit organization founded in 2004 to connect entrepreneurs with investors and mentors. Martinez is also an official member of the Forbes Coaches Council, an invitation-only organization for business and career coaches. She said SVB was an invaluable resource for entrepreneurs of color and offered their clients discounted tech tools and research funding. Minority business owners have long faced challenges accessing capital due to discriminatory lending practices, experts say. Data from the Small Business Credit Survey, a collaboration of all 12 Federal Reserve banks, shows disparities on denial rates for bank and nonbank loans. In 2021, about 16% of Black-led companies acquired the total amount of business financing they sought from banks, compared to 35% of White-owned companies, the survey shows. “We know there’s historic, systemic, and just blatant racism that’s inherent in lending and banking. We have to start there and not tip-toe around it,” Martinez told CNN. Asya Bradley is an immigrant founder of multiple tech companies like Kinley, a financial services business aiming to help Black Americans build generational wealth. Following SVB’s collapse, Bradley said she joined a WhatsApp group of more than 1,000 immigrant business founders. Members of the group quickly mobilized to support one another, she said. Immigrant founders often don’t have Social Security numbers nor permanent addresses in the United States, Bradley said, and it was crucial to brainstorm different ways to find funding in a system that doesn’t recognize them. “The community was really special because a lot of these folks then were sharing different things that they had done to achieve success in terms of getting accounts in different places. They also were able to share different regional banks that have stood up and been like, ‘Hey, if you have accounts at SVB, we can help you guys,’” Bradley said. Many women, people of color and immigrants opt for community or regional banks like SVB, Bradley says, because they are often rejected from the “top four banks” — JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citibank. In her case, Bradley said her gender might have been an issue when she could only open a business account at one of the “top four banks” when her brother co-signed for her. “The top four don’t want our business. The top four are rejecting us consistently. The top four do not give us the service that we deserve. And that’s why we’ve gone to community banks and regional banks such as SVB,” Bradley said. None of the top four banks provided a comment to CNN. The Financial Services Forum, an organization representing the eight largest financial institutions in the United States has said the banks have committed millions of dollars since 2020 to address economic and racial inequality. Last week, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told CNN’s Poppy Harlow that his bank has 30% of its branches in lower-income neighborhoods as part of a $30 billion commitment to Black and Brown communities across the country. Wells Fargo specifically pointed to its 2022 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion report, which discusses the bank’s recent initiatives to reach underserved communities. The bank partnered last year with the Black Economic Alliance to initiate the Black Entrepreneur Fund — a $50 million seed, startup, and early-stage capital fund for businesses founded or led by Black and African American entrepreneurs. And since May 2021, Wells Fargo has invested in 13 Minority Depository Institutions, fulfilling its $50 million pledge to support Black-owned banks. Black-owned banks work to close the lending gap and foster economic empowerment in these traditionally excluded communities, but their numbers have been dwindling over the years, and they have far fewer assets at their disposal than the top banks. OneUnited Bank, the largest Black-owned bank in the United States, manages a little over $650 million in assets. By comparison, JPMorgan Chase manages $3.7 trillion in assets. Because of these disparities, entrepreneurs also seek funding from venture capitalists. In the early 2010s, Hamilton intended to start her own tech company — but as she searched for investors, she saw that White men control nearly all venture capital dollars. That experience led her to establish Backstage Capital, a venture capital fund that invests in new companies led by underrepresented founders. “I said, ‘Well, instead of trying to raise money for one company, let me try to raise for a venture fund that will invest in underrepresented — and now we call them underestimated — founders who are women, people of color, and LGBTQ specifically,’ because I am all three,” Hamilton told CNN. Since then, Backstage Capital has amassed a portfolio of nearly 150 different companies and has made over 120 diversity investments, according to data from Crunchbase. But Bradley, who is also an ‘angel investor’ of minority-owned businesses, said she remains “really hopeful” that community banks, regional banks and fintechs “will all stand up and say, ‘Hey, we are not going to let the good work of SVB go to waste.’” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

In addition to water loss due to an intense multiyear drought, the US Geological Survey and the Bureau of Reclamation report found, Lake Powell faced an average annual loss in storage capacity of about 33,270 acre-feet, or 11 billion gallons, per year between 1963 and 2018. That’s enough water to fill the Reflecting Pool on the National Mall about 1,600 times. The capacity of the reservoir is shrinking because of sediments flowing in from the Colorado and San Juan rivers, according to the report. Those sediments settle at the bottom of the reservoir and decrease the total amount of water the reservoir can hold. As of Monday, Lake Powell was around 25% full, according to data from the Bureau of Reclamation. It’s bad news for a region already facing water shortages and extreme wildfires due to the drought. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration drought experts said last week these conditions are expected to at least continue – if not worsen – in the coming months. Lake Powell is an important reservoir in the Colorado River Basin. Both Lake Powell and nearby Lake Mead, the nation’s largest reservoir, have drained at an alarming rate. In August, the federal government declared a water shortage on the Colorado River for the first time after Lake Mead’s water level plunged to unprecedented lows, triggering mandatory water consumption cuts for states in the Southwest that began in January. And last week, Lake Powell dipped below the critical threshold of 3,525 feet above sea level, sparking additional concerns about water supply and hydropower generation millions of people in the West rely on for electricity. The significance of the dwindling water supply along the Colorado cannot be overstated. The system supplies water for more than 40 million people living across seven Western states and Mexico. Lakes Powell and Mead provide a critical supply of drinking water and irrigation for many across the region, including rural farms, ranches and native communities. “It is vitally important we have the best-available scientific information like this report to provide a clear understanding of water availability in Lake Powell as we plan for the future,” Tanya Trujillo, assistant secretary for water and science with the US Department of Interior, said in a statement. “The Colorado River system faces multiple challenges, including the effects of a 22-year-long drought and the increased impacts of climate change.” © 2024 Cable News Network.

The report by IQAir, a company that tracks global air quality, found that average annual air pollution in every country — and 97% of cities — exceeded the World Health Organization’s air quality guidelines, which were designed to help governments craft regulations to protect public health. Related article Not only is Lake Powell's water level plummeting because of drought, its total capacity is shrinking, too Only 222 cities of the 6,475 analyzed had average air quality that met WHO’s standard. Three territories were found to have met WHO guidelines: the French territory of New Caledonia and the United States territories of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. India, Pakistan and Bangladesh were among the countries with the worst air pollution, exceeding the guidelines by at least 10 times. The Scandinavian countries, Australia, Canada, Japan and United Kingdom ranked among the best countries for air quality, with average levels that exceeded the guidelines by 1 to 2 times. In the United States, IQAir found air pollution exceeded WHO guidelines by 2 to 3 times in 2021. “This report underscores the need for governments around the world to help reduce global air pollution,” Glory Dolphin Hammes, CEO of IQAir North America, told CNN. “(Fine particulate matter) kills far too many people every year and governments need to set more stringent air quality national standards and explore better foreign policies that promote better air quality.” Above: IQAir analyzed average annual air quality for more than 6,000 cities and categorized them from best air quality, in blue (Meets WHO PM2.5 guildline) to worst, in purple (Exceeds WHO PM2.5 guideline by over 10 times). An interactive map is available from IQAir. It’s the first major global air quality report based on WHO’s new annual air pollution guidelines, which were updated in September 2021. The new guidelines halved the acceptable concentration of fine particulate matter — or PM 2.5 — from 10 down to 5 micrograms per cubic meter. PM 2.5 is the tiniest pollutant yet also among the most dangerous. When inhaled, it travels deep into lung tissue where it can enter the bloodstream. It comes from sources like the burning of fossil fuels, dust storms and wildfires, and has been linked to a number of health threats including asthma, heart disease and other respiratory illnesses. Related article Allergy season will start much earlier than normal and be far more intense because of climate crisis, study suggests Millions of people die each year from air quality issues. In 2016, around 4.2 million premature deaths were associated with fine particulate matter, according to WHO. If the 2021 guidelines had been applied that year, WHO found there could have been nearly 3.3 million fewer pollution-related deaths. IQAir analyzed pollution-monitoring stations in 6,475 cities across 117 countries, regions and territories. In the US, air pollution spiked in 2021 compared to 2020. Out of the more than 2,400 US cities analyzed, Los Angeles air remained the most polluted, despite seeing a 6% decrease compared to 2020. Atlanta and Minneapolis saw significant increases in pollution, the report showed. “The (United States’) reliance on fossil fuels, increasing severity of wildfires as well as varying enforcement of the Clean Air Act from administration to administration have all added to U.S. air pollution,” the authors wrote. Researchers say the main sources of pollution in the US were fossil fuel-powered transportation, energy production and wildfires, which wreak havoc on the country’s most vulnerable and marginalized communities. “We are heavily dependent on fossil fuels, especially in terms of transportation,” said Hammes, who lives a few miles from Los Angeles. “We can act smartly on this with zero emissions, but we’re still not doing it. And this is having a devastating impact on the air pollution that we’re seeing in major cities.” Related article Big-box stores could help slash emissions and save millions by putting solar panels on roofs. Why aren't more of them doing it? Climate change-fueled wildfires played a significant role in reducing air quality in the US in 2021. The authors pointed to a number of fires that led to hazardous air pollution — including the Caldor and Dixie fires in California, as well as the Bootleg Fire in Oregon, which wafted smoke all the way to the East Coast in July. China — which is among the countries with the worst air pollution — showed improved air quality in 2021. More than half of the Chinese cities analyzed in the report saw lower levels of air pollution compared to the previous year. The capital city of Beijing continued a five-year trend of improved air quality, according to the report, due to a policy-driven drawdown of polluting industries in the city. The report also found that the Amazon Rainforest, which had acted as the world’s major defender against the climate crisis, emitted more carbon dioxide than it absorbed last year. Deforestation and wildfires have threatened the critical ecosystem, polluted the air and contributed to climate change. “This is all a part of the formula that will lead to or is leading to global warming.” Hammes said. The report also unveiled some inequalities: Monitoring stations remain scant in some developing countries in Africa, South America and the Middle East, resulting in a dearth of air quality data in those regions. “When you don’t have that data, you’re really in the dark,” Hammes said. Related article Could Russia's war kick-start a renewable-energy revolution? It depends where in the world you look Hammes noted the African country of Chad was included in the report for the first time, due to an improvement in its monitoring network. IQAir found the country’s air pollution was the second-highest in the world last year, behind Bangladesh. Tarik Benmarhnia, a climate change epidemiologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography who has studied the health impact of wildfire smoke, also noted that relying only on monitoring stations can lead to blind spots in these reports. “I think it is great that they relied on different networks and not only governmental sources,” Benmarhnia, who was not involved in this report, told CNN. “However, many regions do not have enough stations and alternative techniques exist.” The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded in its 2021 report that, in addition to slowing the speed of global warming, curbing the use of fossil fuels would have the added benefit of improving air quality and public health. Hammes said the IQAir report is even more reason for the world to wean off fossil fuel. “We’ve got the report, we can read it, we can internalize it and really devote ourselves to taking action,” she said. “There needs to be a major move towards renewable energy. We need to take drastic action in order to reverse the tide of global warming; otherwise, the impact and the train that we’re on (would be) irreversible.” © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

At the IKEA store in Baltimore, installing solar panels on the roof and over the store’s parking lot cut the amount of energy it needed to purchase by 84%, slashing its costs by 57% from September to December of 2020, according to the company. (The panels also provide some beneficial shade to keep customers’ cars cool on hot, sunny days.) Related article Could Russia's war kick-start a renewable-energy revolution? It depends where in the world you look As of February 2021, IKEA had 54 solar arrays installed across 90% of its US locations. Big-box stores and shopping centers have enough roof space to produce half of their annual electricity needs from solar, according to a report from nonprofit Environment America and research firm Frontier Group. Leveraging the full rooftop solar potential of these superstores would generate enough electricity to power nearly 8 million average homes, the report concluded, and would cut the same amount of planet-warming emissions as pulling 11.3 million gas-powered cars off the road. The average Walmart store, for example, has 180,000 square feet of rooftop, according to the report. That’s roughly the size of three football fields and enough space to support solar energy that could power the equivalent of 200 homes, the report said. “Every rooftop in America that isn’t producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them,” Johanna Neumann, senior director for Environment America’s campaign for 100% Renewable, told CNN. “Now is the time to lean into local renewable energy production, and there’s no better place than the roofs of America’s big-box superstores.” Advocates involved in clean energy worker-training programs tell CNN that a solar revolution in big-box retail would also be a significant windfall for local communities, spurring economic growth while tackling the climate crisis, which has inflicted disproportionate harm on marginalized communities. Yet only a fraction of big-box stores in the US have solar on their rooftops or solar canopies in parking lots, the report’s authors told CNN. Related article Why record-high gas prices won't be solved by drilling more oil in the US CNN reached out to five of the top US retailers — Walmart, Kroger, Home Depot, Costco and Target — to ask: Why not invest in more rooftop solar? Many renewable energy experts point to solar as a relatively simple solution to cut down on costs and help rein in fossil fuel emissions, but the companies point to several roadblocks — regulations, labor costs and structural integrity of the rooftops themselves — that are preventing more widespread adoption. The need for these kinds of clean energy initiatives is becoming “unquestionably urgent” as the climate crisis accelerates, said Edwin Cowen, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Cornell University. “We are behind the eight ball, to put it mildly,” Cowen told CNN. “I would have loved to see policy help incentivize rooftop solar 15 years ago instead of five years ago in the commercial space. There’s still a tremendous amount of work to do.” Neumann said Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, possesses by far the largest solar potential. Walmart has around 5,000 stores in the US and more than 783 million square feet of rooftop space — an area larger than Manhattan — and more than 8,974 gigawatt hours of annual rooftop solar potential, according to the report. It’s enough electricity to power more than 842,000 homes, the report said. “Every rooftop in America that isn’t producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them.” Johanna Neumann, Environment America Walmart spokesperson Mariel Messier told CNN the company is involved in renewable energy projects around the world, but many of them are not rooftop solar installations. The company has reported having completed on- and off-site wind and solar projects or had others under development with a capacity to produce more than 2.3 gigawatts of renewable energy. Neumann said Environment America has met with Walmart a few times, urging the retailer to commit to installing solar panels on roofs and in parking lots. The company has said it’s aiming to source 100% of its energy through renewable projects by 2035. “Of all the retailers in America, Walmart stands to make the biggest impact if they put rooftop solar on all of their stores,” Neumann told CNN. “And for us, this report just underscores just how much of an impact they could make if they make that decision.” According to Environment America, Walmart had installed almost 194 megawatts of solar capacity on its US facilities as of the end of the 2021 fiscal year and additional capacity in off-site solar farms. The company’s installations in California were expected to provide between 20% to 30% of each location’s electricity needs. Target ranked No. 1 for on-site solar capacity in 2019, according to industry trade group Solar Energy Industries Association’s most recent report. It currently has 542 locations with rooftop solar — around a quarter of the company’s stores — a Target spokesperson told CNN. Rooftop solar generates enough energy to meet 15% to 40% of Target properties’ energy needs, the spokesperson said. Richard Galanti, the chief financial officer at Costco, said the company has 121 stores with rooftop solar around the world, 95 of which are in the US. Walmart, Target and Costco did not share with CNN what their biggest barriers are to adding rooftop or parking lot solar panels to more stores.  “My suspicion is that they want an even stronger business case for deviating from business-as-usual,” Neumann said. “Historically, all those roofs have done is cover their stores, and rethinking how [they] use their buildings and thinking of them as energy generators, not just protection from rain, requires a small change in their business model.” Home Depot, which has around 2,300 stores, currently has 75 completed rooftop solar projects, 12 in construction and more than 30 planned for future development, said Craig D’Arcy, the company’s director of energy management. Solar power generates around half of these stores’ energy needs on average, he said. Aging rooftops at stores are a “huge impediment” to solar installation, D’Arcy added. If a roof needs to be replaced in the next 15 to 20 years or sooner, it doesn’t make financial sense for Home Depot to add solar systems today, he said. “We have a goal of implementing solar rooftop where the economics are attractive,” D’Arcy told CNN. CNN also reached out to Kroger, which owns about 2,800 stores across the US. Kristal Howard, a Kroger spokesperson, said the company currently has 15 properties — stores, distribution centers and manufacturing plants — with solar installations. One of the “multiple factors affecting the viability of a solar installation” was the stores’ ability to support a solar installation on the roofs, Howard said. Cowen, the engineering professor at Cornell, said solar is already attractive, but that labor costs, incentives and the different layers of regulation likely pose some financial challenges in solar installations. “For them, this means usually hiring a local site firm that can do that installation that also knows local policy,” Cowen said. “It’s just another layer of complexity that I think is beginning to make sense because the costs have come down enough, but it needs kind of reopening that door of getting into an existing building.” Related article 'Delay means death': We're running out of ways to adapt to the climate crisis, new report shows. Here are the key takeaways Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois, who co-chairs the power sector task force in the House, said the US has “failed to provide the incentives to people who have the expertise to go in and build these things.” The reason both retail companies and the power sector have not made much progress on solar is because “our system is so disjointed” and has a complex regulation structure, Casten said. “Why aren’t we doing something that makes economic sense? The answer is this horribly disjointed federal policy where we massively subsidize fossil energy extraction, and we penalize clean energy production,” Casten told CNN. “For a long, long time, if you wanted to build a solar panel on the rooftop of Walmart, your biggest enemy was going to be your local utility because they didn’t want to lose the load. “We could have done this decades ago,” Casten added. “And had we done it, we would not be in this dire position with the climate, but we’d also have a lot more money in our pocket.” For Charles Callaway, director of organizing at the nonprofit group WE ACT for Environmental Justice, strengthening the rooftop solar capacity in big box retail stores is a no-brainer, especially if companies allow the local community to reap benefits either through installation jobs or sharing the electricity produced later. Either way, it would put a massive dent in curbing the climate crisis and help usher in an equitable transition away from fossil fuels — and it’s doable, Callaway told CNN. The New York City resident led a worker training program that helped train more than 100 local community members, mostly people of color, to become solar installers. He also formed a solar workers cooperative to ensure many of the participants of the training program get jobs in a tough market. In the last two years, Callaway said his group has not only installed solar panels on roofs of affordable housing units, but also equipment capable of producing 2 megawatts of solar energy on shopping malls up in upstate New York. He emphasized that hiring locally would be most beneficial since local installers know the community and local regulations best. Related article Allergy season will start much earlier than normal and be far more intense because of climate crisis, study suggests “One of my huge concerns is social equity,” Cowen said. “Access to renewable energy is a fairly privileged position these days, and we’ve got to figure out ways to make that not true.” Jasmine Graham, WE ACT’s energy justice policy manager, said the potential of building rooftop solar on big box superstores is encouraging, only “if these projects use local labor, if they are paying prevailing wages, and if this solar is being used in a manner such as community solar, which would allow [utility] bill discounts for folks that live in the same utility zone.” Pressure is mounting for global leaders to act urgently on the climate crisis after a UN report in late February warned the window for action is rapidly closing. Neumann believes the US can meet its energy demand with renewables. All it takes, she said, is the political will to make that switch, and the inclusion of the local community so no one gets left behind in the transition. “The sooner we make that transition, the sooner we’ll have cleaner air, the sooner we’ll have a more protected environment and better health and the sooner we’ll have a more livable future for our kids,” Neumann said. “And even if that requires investment, it is an investment worth making.” CNN’s Judson Jones contributed to this report. © 2024 Cable News Network.

1,2024-08-04 07:36:36.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-04 05:09:50.000,Look of the Week: Blackpink headline Coachella in Korean hanboks,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/blackpink-coachella-2023-hanboks-lotw/index.html,2023-04-18 15:39:40.000,"Editor’s Note: Featuring the good, the bad and the ugly, ‘Look of the Week’ is a regular series dedicated to unpacking the most talked about outfit of the last seven days. Bringing the second day of this year’s Coachella to a close, K-Pop girl group Blackpink made history Saturday night when they became the first Asian act to ever headline the festival. To a crowd of, reportedly, over 125,000 people, Jennie, Jisoo, Lisa and Rosé used the ground-breaking moment to pay homage to Korean heritage by arriving onstage in hanboks: a traditional type of dress. While the garments were shrugged off a few seconds into their opening track, “Pink Venom,” revealing each member’s custom black and pink Dolce and Gabbana outfit, fans across the world had already received the message. Screenshots of the moment quickly spread among Blackpink superfans, otherwise known as Blinks. “The way they stepped onto the biggest western stage in hanboks … literally proved their place at the top of the industry,” tweeted one Blink. “Blackpink really are in a league of their own.” Another called the group “Korea’s cultural delegation” on Instagram, in reference to not only the hanboks but other visual cues incorporated into their show, such as one of the stage backdrops featuring an angular tiled roof reminiscent of traditional Korean architecture. Look of the Week: Are we about to see more men in tights? In recent years, Blackpink have enjoyed a meteoric rise to global fame. According to Guinness World Records, they are currently the most streamed female group on Spotify, and have the most-viewed music YouTube channel. Last year, they were the first female K-Pop group to reach number 1 in the UK and US album charts, and in 2020 their track “How You Like That” became the most viewed video on YouTube in 24 hours. (The group also wore modernized hanboks, designed by Kim Danha, in one of the music video’s scenes.) Their landmark set over the weekend was in fact a follow-up to another milestone: In 2019, they became the first female K-Pop group to ever play at Coachella or any other US festival. From the iconic Jean Paul Gaultier cone bra worn by Madonna for her 1990 Blond Ambition tour to Geri “Ginger Spice” Halliwell’s Union Jack mini dress, the right stage costume can live on forever in public memory. Particularly when worn at a career-defining moment. During another watershed Coachella performance — Beyonce’s 2018 headline set — the singer’s custom Balmain collegiate-style yellow hoodie was a joyful nod to Black culture, specifically historically Black colleagues and universities. The group’s four black hanboks were custom created by South Korean pattern design brand OUWR and traditional Korean dressmakers Kumdanje. Inspired by the Cheol-lik silhouette, each garment was hand-embroidered with metallic traditional Korean motifs, including dan-cheong patterns and peonies (a symbol of royalty in Korea). “It was our pleasure and such an honor to be able to show the beautiful values of Korea and Hanbok together,” the designers wrote in a combined Instagram post. “Blackpink showed the beauty of Korea and dazzled the world.” In Korea, hanboks are still worn for special occasions and often seen on TV dramas. Many designers in the country have also created contemporary takes that are incorporated into everyday wear. At Seoul Fashion Week, JULYCOLUMN’s Fall-Winter 2023 collection drew on the hanbok’s voluminous silhouette to create shirts and structured jackets. Last September, Korean label BlueTamburin brought the garment to a Western audience by exclusively using traditional hanbok fabric to create its Spring-Summer 2023 collection at Milan Fashion Week. Look of the Week: 'Barbie' stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling hit the road in bubblegum pink Whether you’re a devoted Blink or not, the looks marked a moment of Asian visibility, recognition of traditional craftsmanship and a powerful example of feeling seen through fashion — representing Korean culture and symbolically embracing both its past and future. At the end of their performance, and having addressed the audience between numbers in English throughout their two-hour-long performance, Blackpink finished their set in Korean: “Until now, it has been Jennie, Jisoo, Lisa, and Rosé Blackpink. Thank you.” Top image: Blackpink performing at the first weekend of Coachella 2023, shortly after removing their hanboks. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

1,2024-08-04 07:36:36.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-04 05:09:50.000,Scientists identify secret ingredient in Leonardo da Vinci paintings,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/old-masters-da-vinci-egg-yolk-painting-scn/index.html,2023-03-30 17:43:18.000,"Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. “Old Masters” such as Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli and Rembrandt may have used proteins, especially egg yolk, in their oil paintings, according to a new study. Trace quantities of protein residue have long been detected in classic oil paintings, though they were often ascribed to contamination. A new study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications found the inclusion was likely intentional — and sheds light on the technical knowledge of the Old Masters, the most skilled European painters of the 16th, 17th, or early 18th century, and the way they prepared their paints. Scientists confirm long held theory about what inspired Monet “There are very few written sources about this and no scientific work has been done before to investigate the subject in such depth,” said study author Ophélie Ranquet of the Institute of Mechanical Process Engineering and Mechanics at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany, in a phone interview. “Our results show that even with a very small amount of egg yolk, you can achieve an amazing change of properties in the oil paint, demonstrating how it might have been beneficial for the artists.” Simply adding some egg yolk to their works, it turns out, could have long-lasting effects that went beyond just aesthetics. Compared with the medium formulated by ancient Egyptians called tempera — which combines egg yolk with powdered pigments and water — oil paint creates more intense colors, allows for very smooth color transitions and dries far less quickly, so it can be used for several days after its preparation. However, oil paint, which uses linseed or safflower oil instead of water, also has drawbacks, including being more susceptible to color darkening and damage caused by exposure to light. Because making paint was an artisanal and experimental process, it is possible that the Old Masters might have added egg yolk, a familiar ingredient, to the newer type of paint, which first showed up in the seventh century in Central Asia before spreading to Northern Europe in the Middle Ages and Italy during the Renaissance. In the study, the researchers recreated the process of paint-making by using four ingredients — egg yolk, distilled water, linseed oil and pigment — to mix two historically popular and significant colors, lead white and ultramarine blue. “The addition of egg yolk is beneficial because it can tune the properties of these paints in a drastic way,” Ranquet said, “For example by showing aging differently: It takes a longer time for the paint to oxidize, because of the antioxidants contained in the yolk.” The chemical reactions between the oil, the pigment and the proteins in the yolk directly affect the paint’s behavior and viscosity. “For example, the lead white pigment is quite sensitive to humidity, but if you coat it with a protein layer, it makes it a lot more resistant to it, making the paint quite easy to apply,” Ranquet said. “On the other hand, if you wanted something stiffer without having to add a lot of pigment, with a bit of egg yolk you can create a high impasto paint,” she added, referring to a painting technique where the paint is laid out in a stroke thick enough that the brushstrokes are still visible. Using less pigment would have been desirable centuries ago, when certain pigments — such as lapis lazuli, which was used to make ultramarine blue — were more expensive than gold, according to Ranquet. A direct evidence of the effect of egg yolk in oil paint, or lack thereof, can be seen in Leonardo da Vinci’s “Madonna of the Carnation,” one of the paintings observed during the study. Currently on display at the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, Germany, the work shows evident wrinkling on the face of Mary and the child. “Oil paint starts to dry from the surface down, which is why it wrinkles,” Ranquet said. One reason for wrinkling may be an insufficient quantity of pigments in the paint, and the study has shown that this effect could be avoided with the addition of egg yolk: “That’s quite amazing because you have the same quantity of pigment in your paint, but the presence of the egg yolk changes everything.” Because wrinkling occurs within days, it’s likely that Leonardo and other Old Masters might have caught onto this particular effect, as well as additional beneficial properties of egg yolk in oil paint, including resistance to humidity. The “Madonna of Carnation” is one of Leonardo’s earliest paintings, created at a time when he might have been still trying to master the then newly popular medium of oil paint. Another painting observed during the study was “The Lamentation Over the Dead Christ,” by Botticelli, also on display at the Alte Pinakothek. The work is mostly made with tempera, but oil paint has been used for the background and some secondary elements. “We knew that some parts of the paintings show brushstrokes that are typical for what we call an oil painting, and yet we detected the presence of proteins,” Ranquet said. “Because it’s a very small quantity and they are difficult to detect, this might be dismissed as contamination: In workshops, artists used many different things, and maybe the eggs were just from the tempera.” However, because adding egg yolk had such desirable effects on oil paint, the presence of proteins in the work might be an indication of deliberate use instead, the study suggested. Ranquet hopes that these preliminary findings might attract more curiosity toward this understudied topic. DNA analysis of Beethoven's hair reveals health issues — and a family secret Maria Perla Colombini, a professor of analytical chemistry at the University of Pisa in Italy, who was not involved in the study, agreed. “This exciting paper provides a new scenario for the understanding of old painting techniques,” she said in an email. “The research group, reporting results from molecular level up to a macroscopic scale, contributes to a new knowledge in the use of egg yolk and oil binders. They are not more looking at simply identifying the materials used by Old Masters but explain how they could produce wonderful and glittering effects by employing and mixing the few available natural materials. They try to discover the secrets of old recipes of which little or nothing is written,” she added. “This new knowledge contributes not only to a better conservation and preservation of artworks but also to a better comprehension of art history.” Top image: The “Mona Lisa” by Leonardo Da Vinci © 2024 Cable News Network.

1,2024-08-04 07:36:36.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-04 05:09:50.000,How Playboy cut ties with Hugh Hefner to create a post-MeToo brand,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/playboy-the-conversation/index.html,2023-04-11 07:10:28.000,"Editor’s Note: The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation. Hugh Hefner launched Playboy Magazine 70 years ago this year. The first issue included a nude photograph of Marilyn Monroe, which he had purchased and published without her knowledge or consent. Hefner went on to build the Playboy brand off the backs of the countless women featured in its pages, whose beauty and performance of heightened feminine sexuality have entertained its readers for generations. Approaching its 70th anniversary in December, Playboy has radically shifted. With the magazine no longer in publication, the Playboy Mansion sold to a developer and London’s last remaining Playboy Club closing in 2021, what is the future for Playboy? The brand is changing to keep up with the post-#MeToo world. Hefner passed away one month before allegations against film producer Harvey Weinstein surfaced in 2017 giving momentum to the #MeToo movement (which saw survivors of sexual assault and harassment speak out against their abusers). READ MORE: Sex, love and companionship … with AI? Why human-machine relationships could go mainstream In recent years, many have re-evaluated Hefner’s legacy and relationships with women. The 2022 docuseries “The Secrets of Playboy” (which aired on Channel 4 in the UK) detailed sexual misconduct accusations against Hefner from several ex-girlfriends, including model Sondra Theodore and TV personality Holly Madison. Hefner and Playboy’s relationship with women has been complicated. Playboy was an early supporter of abortion rights, helped fund the first rape kit and was at times an early proponent of inclusivity (for example featuring transgender model, Caroline “Tula” Cossey, in its June 1981 issue). But most women featured in Playboy have fit within a narrow beauty standard — thin, white, able-bodied and blonde. Meanwhile Hefner’s personal relationship with his much younger girlfriends reportedly followed patterns of control and emotional abuse. Ex-girlfriend Holly Madison described Hefner as treating her “like a glorified pet” in her 2015 memoir, “Down the Rabbit Hole.” Hefner’s passing meant he evaded reckoning with the #MeToo movement. Playboy, however, responded, releasing a statement in which it affirmed support for the women featured in “The Secrets of Playboy” and called Hefner’s actions “abhorrent.” The statement declared that the brand was no longer affiliated with the Hefner family and would be focusing on aspects of the company’s legacy that align with values of sex positivity and free expression. READ MORE: The ‘milf’: a brief cultural history, from Mrs Robinson to Stifler’s mom Today, Playboy is a very different company from the one Hefner launched nearly 70 years ago. Roughly 80% of Playboy staff identify as women, according the company, and its motto has changed from “Entertainment for Men” to “Pleasure for All.” Shares in the company are publicly traded and 40% of its board and management are women. The company has also moved towards more creator-led content through its app, Playboy Centerfold. Similar to subscription content service OnlyFans, Playboy Centerfold allows subscribers to view content from and interact with its creators, which it call “bunnies.” On the app, creators — or bunnies — are able portray their own bodies however they wish, putting the power back in their hands. Perhaps Playboy’s future is no longer in serving the male gaze, but instead the very audience Hefner dismissed in his first letter from the editor: “If you’re a man between the ages of 18 and 80 Playboy is meant for you … If you’re somebody’s sister, wife or mother-in-law and picked us up by mistake, please pass us along to the man in your life and get back to your Ladies Home Companion.” The stars of Playboy’s mid-2000s reality series, Holly Madison and Bridget Marquardt, are also enjoying a resurgence among fans. “The Girls Next Door” launched in 2004. The show focused on the lives of Hefner’s three girlfriends, Madison, Marquardt and Kendra Wilkinson. It became E’s best performing show and cultivated a new female audience for Playboy. “The Girls Next Door” was a story of complicated empowerment despite patriarchal interference. Its three female protagonists went from being known solely as some of Hefner’s many blonde girlfriends, to celebrities in their own right. They each ultimately broke up with Hefner, leaving the Mansion and going on to lead successful careers. The show’s depiction of Madison, Marquardt and Wilkinson as empowered, fun-loving and complex individuals, who found joy and agency through expressing their sexuality was perhaps what drew so many female fans to the show. However, amid the girls’ fight for agency, Hefner retaliated. The series shows that he maintained final say in every Playboy photograph of the girls, as well as imposing strict curfews and spending allowances. In Madison and Wilkinson’s memoirs, “Down the Rabbit Hole,” and “Sliding into Home,” they claim that production consistently undermined them. They refused to pay them for the first season, didn’t credit them until season four and aired their uncensored nude bodies in foreign broadcasts and DVD releases without consent. READ MORE: #MeToo in space: We must address the potential for sexual harassment and assault away from Earth Fan interest in “The Girls Next Door” remains strong. In August 2022 Madison and Marquardt launched their podcast “Girls Next Level,” where they interview previous playmates and interact with fans. They also recap episodes from their own points of view, unpacking their experiences of working on the show. Having reached 10 million downloads as of February 2023, the success of the podcast — 14 years after the last episode of “The Girls Next Door” — speaks to the cultural legacy of the Playboy brand. It also shows that despite Hefner’s original editor’s note, Playboy resonates with some women. Playboy is now in a post-Hefner era, where the imagery of women found within old issues of Playboy can serve as inspiration for others to enjoy their own sexuality. Whatever the future has for the company, the concept of Playboy has become public property — be that in the appearance of Playboy bunny costumes each Halloween, the popularity of cheeky Playboy logo tattoos or branded lingerie and clothing. In a post-#MeToo era, the women of Playboy are speaking up and taking over. With the mansion gates closed, the bunnies are finally reclaiming the brand as their own.

1,2024-08-04 07:36:36.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-04 05:09:50.000,'A definitive backslide.' Inside fashion's worrying runway trend,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/fashion-week-fall-winter-2023-size-diversity-skinny-wegovy/index.html,2023-04-06 20:53:38.000,"Now that the Fall-Winter 2023 catwalks have been disassembled, it’s clear one trend was more pervasive than any collective penchant for ruffles, pleated skirts or tailored coats. Across runways in New York, London, Milan and Paris, there was a notable scarcity of plus-size models. This comes at a time when there are five injectable medications which can be used as appetite suppressants currently available by prescription in the US, stirring much conversation; a sixth medication, Rybelsus, is taken as an oral pill. Two are officially approved in the UK — the largest influx of weight loss medication seen in the country in almost a decade. Dior's landmark Mumbai show signals India's growing luxury status In recent months, injectables such as Wegovy and Ozempic — which share the same active ingredient, semaglutide — have been widely reported as Hollywood’s worst-kept weight loss secret. (Ozempic is intended for use primarily to treat Type 2 diabetes.) Comedian Chelsea Handler claimed her “anti-aging doctor just hands (Ozempic) out to anybody” while appearing on a podcast in January. Even Elon Musk tweeted last year about being on Wegovy. For many fashion commentators and diversity advocates, the Fall-Winter 2023 runways were in sharp contrast to the (albeit limited) progress and heady promise of recent seasons. This rollback has been widely criticized in the style media as such. And its potential impact is being assessed more broadly: With the rise of these weight loss panaceas, the pursuit of size zero is now just a prescription away. In 2020, Jill Kortleve and Paloma Elsesser became the first models outside of a sample size to walk for the Italian fashion house Fendi. (Traditionally, a sample size falls between a US 0-4.) British label Erdem entered the plus-size market in 2021, extending its offering to a UK size 22 (or US size 18). And in January 2022, Valentino made headlines after its haute couture show featured a broad spectrum of body types. But this season, there was a visible lack of curve bodies on their runways — or many others. Fendi and Valentino did not respond when contacted by CNN, while Erdem declined to comment. According to fashion search engine Tagwalk, the number of mid and plus-size models dropped by 24% in comparison to Spring-Summer 2023. Similarly, a size inclusivity report conducted by Vogue Business found that 95.6% of all looks presented for Fall-Winter 2023 were in a size US 0-4. For context, industry market firm Plunkett Research estimated in 2015 that 68% of American women wear a size US 14 or above. “It was a definitive backslide,” said IMG model agent Mina White, who represents plus-size and curve supermodels including Elsesser and Ashley Graham. “It was frustrating to see some of these designers not using curved bodies where they had in the past.” Fendi and Valentino did not respond when contacted by CNN, while Erdem declined to comment. “Watching somebody like Ashley Graham attend the front row for so many of these major houses in full looks (provided by the designer), it was frustrating,” White continued. “They wanted to utilize her image and her social following to command a certain space in the market, but they didn’t want to be reflective on their runways.” For others, even the term “backslide” was too generous. “Slipping back from… what? A glorious time when the average American woman (size 16) was as present on the runways as she is in everyday life? A time when fashion ads cast as many ‘plus-size’ and ‘mid-size’ women as ‘straight-size’ women?” fashion journalist Amy Odell wrote in her Substack newsletter of this past season’s runways. “No one needed any data to understand that representing a wide array of body shapes and sizes in runway shows or in fashion imagery is not a priority for the industry.” That said, a handful of — mostly smaller — brands pushed ahead this season. In London, emerging labels Di Petsa, Karoline Vitto and Sinead O’Dwyer showcased lineups of size-diverse models. Inclusivity at Christian Siriano, Coach, Kim Shui, Collina Strada and Bach Mai stood out in New York; while in Paris, Belgian brand Esther Manas — a consistent flag-bearer for size diversity — staged one of the city’s most refreshing runways with an assortment of fun, sensual, feminine looks that complimented a range of bodies. There was also a smattering of mid- and plus-size castings to be seen elsewhere: Off-White and Michael Kors, for example, featured a few such models. At Harris Reed’s debut for Nina Ricci, Precious Lee opened the show — which also featured three more plus- and mid-size models. Fashion samples and sample size pieces are one-off garments made before an item is mass-produced, typically to be worn during runway shows. Prioritizing the same body type in sample sizes means runway models are more easily interchangeable, saving fashion houses time and money if someone were to drop out or get sick during or after the casting process for a show. It’s also partly why, according to White, casting curve models is still an uphill battle. She says she introduces brands to new faces months in advance of runway season, with their specific measurements up-top and easy to read in all correspondence. “I want to be ahead of that,” White said. “So I’m never told ‘Oh, we wanted to make it work, but we didn’t have her size’ or whatever that conversation might look like.” Look of the Week: What Pope Francis' AI puffer coat says about the future of fashion But despite her efforts, she says she’s frequently told it’s too much of a “financial lift” to make larger samples — even by legacy brands. “I get very upset when brands say that,” White said. “I don’t believe that it is, I believe that it’s people not being properly educated on how to do this right.” Beyond the lack of representation, White notes it’s painful for plus-size consumers to watch brands leverage resources to create custom, made-to-fit pieces for celebrities — all the while claiming the pot is empty for more inclusive runway samples. London-based stylist and editor Francesca Burns agrees sample sizes are part of the problem. In 2020, Burns went viral after she posted on Instagram about a fashion job gone wrong. She says she was sent five looks to style from Celine, none of which fit the size UK 8 (US 4) model booked for the shoot— an 18-year-old on her first job in the business. The experience left her “horrified,” Burns told CNN, recalling what she saw as the model’s shame and embarrassment. “Looking into this girl’s eyes,” Burns said, “she shouldn’t have felt like that.” Burns’ post, which called the current system “unacceptable,” was picked up widely in the fashion media. (When reached by CNN, Celine declined to comment on the incident.) “Ultimately, the desire to see change has to be there,” Burns said. “And I wonder whether luxury has that desire?” Progress has been slow, but not entirely inexistent. Across fashion campaigns, magazine covers and editorial shoots, there is a growing enthusiasm for inclusivity. “I see the options rolling in for the plus-sized talent, and they’re great offerings,” said White. “Great, strong editorials and covers and campaigns. But I do feel like without the clothes, we are going to go back to see more naked curve stories, or lingerie curve stories or a curve girl in a trench coat. That’s what I don’t want.” For British Vogue’s April issue, unveiled March 16, Elsesser, Lee and Jill Kortleve were dubbed “The New Supers.” Preceding the cover story is a letter written by editor-in-chief, Edward Enninful commending the models for “leading the way” and holding “powerful space” in the industry. “Catwalks are once again under scrutiny for a stark lack of body diversity,” read the magazine’s Instagram caption, unveiling the cover. “But this cover was not conceived as a statement. It is a crowning of an all-powerful trio, the supermodels for a new generation.” But many online were quick to point out the disconnect: Two of the Saint Laurent Spring-Summer 2023 dresses were modeled by plus-size women, though they are not available to buy in most plus sizes. In his own social media post, Enninful wrote about his disappointment at the Fall-Winter 2023 runways. “I thought I had gotten into a time machine. Show after show dominated by one body type, so many limited visions of womanhood… one prescribed notion of beauty prevailed again, and it felt like the reality of so many women around the world were being ignored.” But for White, the power rests within the entire industry — not just at the feet of brands. “I really do believe there should be an industry standard between the (Council of Fashion Designers of America), the British Fashion Council and key editors at some of these major mass market magazines,” she continued. “If there was a call-to-action from these figureheads saying, moving forward samples need to be readily available for a few different body types, we would see significant and impactful change.” Burns agrees there must be a trickle-down effect. “I think a lot of responsibility is put on young designers to solve all these issues around sustainability or issues around body inclusivity,” she said. “It’s important that the big powerhouses, which have the capacity to action change, really take some responsibility.” On March 8, Wegovy — developed primarily as a treatment for those living with obesity and weight-related conditions — was approved in the UK. It’s the second injectable weight management medication to be made available with a prescription via the country’s National Health Service (NHS) in about 3 years, after almost a decade of quiet. Before 2020, the last weight loss medication was approved in the UK was in 2010. Similarly, the US has now approved three weight management injections: Wegovy, Saxenda and IMCIVREE. Medications for type-2 diabetes like Mounjaro and Ozempic are not FDA-approved for weight loss, though some doctors are issuing them at their own discretion. While these medicines are a revolutionary tool for those who struggle to lose weight for genetic or medical reasons, they are at risk of being abused. Semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic, was originally developed for treating type-2 diabetes. It quells hunger signals to the brain by mimicking the hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). “It can slow how quickly your stomach empties out and may give you a little more feeling of feeling full,” said Dr. Robert Lash, an endocrinologist and Chief Medical Officer of the Endocrine Society in Washington, D.C. In clinical trials, over a period of 68 weeks, participants who used the medication in conjunction with eating fewer calories and increasing their physical activity on average lost around 15% of their body weight compared to 2.4% of those using a placebo, according to the manufacturer Novo Nordisk. On March 13, the European Medicines Agency issued a statement warning of an Ozempic shortage that could continue through the year, urging doctors to prioritize prescriptions to diabetics. “Any other use, including for weight management, represents off-label use and currently places the availability of Ozempic for the indicated population at risk,” read the release. Patients typically need a BMI of 27 or higher (along with another weight-related condition like high blood pressure or diabetes) or have a genetic predisposition towards obesity to be prescribed such appetite suppressant medication by their doctor. But talk of these injectables has been sweeping the West. In January, the New York Times reported on the term “Ozempic Face,” coined by a New York-based dermatologist who reported treating several patients with a hollowed-out appearance that can come with rapid weight loss. By the end of February, the medication had made it to the cover of New York Magazine in a feature titled “Life After Food?” Adverts for GLP-1 injections are even blanketing New York City subway stations. And across social media, online forums and private group chats, some people looking to lose weight for primarily aesthetic purposes are searching for a way to skirt the requirements. “I was just looking for a way to lose a few pounds, like 10 to 15 at most,” said one 30-year-old American woman, who wished to remain anonymous, in a phone interview. She scoured social media and forums for guidance on securing a weight loss drug. “I’m certainly a normal BMI, I just have a trip to Mexico coming up and I want to look really good,” she said. Although she says she found a way to access Wegovy, she decided against the medication after considering the cost (which can reach more than $1,000 a month without insurance). “I’ve always very much fit the societal standard but lately I was just like f*ck it, I want to be skinny,” she told CNN. Dr. Lash emphasized the importance of taking weight loss drugs only with medical supervision and a valid prescription. “If somebody was a normal weight and they took this drug because they thought they could be even thinner than they are now, that could lead to complications,” he told CNN, warning of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and even gallbladder problems. “These drugs are not benign, they do have side effects involving the GI tract. There’s no such thing as a free lunch.” Fashion has long promoted size 0 as the ultimate virtue — regardless of its viability for many people, or any health risks. And now with the accessibility of accelerated weight loss medication, the stakes are even higher. For Burns and White, the industry is responsible for amplifying a new, more inclusive vision of beauty. “There’s a very archaic way of looking at women over a size 16 and just assuming that they’re unhealthy or uneducated or unstylish. Or don’t have the resources to buy into luxury,” said White. “The reality is the same women these brands are alienating in their fashion space are the same women running out to buy their handbags, shoes, perfumes, cosmetics and skincare.” Not only do designers need to create clothes with this consumer in mind, according to White, but they need to be seen on the runway, too. “It shouldn’t be a conversation. It should just be normalized that we’re not just looking at a single view of beauty,” echoed Burns. Ester Manas and Balthazar Delepierre, whose bridal-inspired Fall-Winter 2023 collection was one of this season’s most size-diverse runways, summarized it best in their accompanying show notes: “The body is not the subject. Because, obviously, at a wedding, everybody is invited. And all to the party. That is where the designer duo Ester and Balthazar take their stand.” © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

In 1998, Michael Jordan laced up a pair of his iconic black and red Air Jordan 13s to bring home a Bulls victory during Game 2 of his final NBA championship — and now they are the most expensive sneakers ever to sell at auction.The game-winning sneakers sold for $2.2 million at Sotheby’s in New York on Tuesday, smashing the sneaker auction record of $1.47 million, set in 2021 by a pair of Nike Air Ships that Jordan wore earlier in his career. Remember when Dennis Rodman put on a wedding dress and claimed to marry himself? The sale arrives during “Jordan Year” — a reference to the NBA star player’s iconic jersey number 23. In January, Air Jordan partnered with Sotheby’s to auction off 13 pairs of retro sneakers that were designed in memory of The Notorious B.I.G. All lots outsold their high estimates of $5,000 by multiples, with the highest selling for more than $32,000. Last year, Jordan’s Game 1 jersey, also from the 1998 finals, became the most expensive item of worn sports memorabilia to sell at auction when it fetched $10.1 million at a Sotheby’s sale. Jordan’s farewell run with the Chicago Bulls is often referred to as “The Last Dance,” after the title of an ESPN and Netflix documentary that chronicled the season. Jordan announced his (second) retirement weeks before the finals, leading to the six-game series against the Utah Jazz becoming the most-watched in NBA history, based on Nielsen TV ratings. (Jordan would later return from 2001 to 2003 to play with the Washington Wizards, but did not win another championship). “Michael Jordan game-worn sports memorabilia has proven time and time again to be the most elite and coveted items on the market,” said Brahm Wachter, Sotheby’s head of streetwear and modern collectables, in a press release prior to the sale. “However, items from his ‘Last Dance’ season are of a greater scale and magnitude as seen with our record-breaking sale of his Game 1 jersey in 2022.” The pair of sneakers sold Tuesday were worn during Game 2, in Salt Lake City, which the Bulls won 93-88 after losing Game 1, with Jordan scoring 37 points. They are the last pair of black and red Air Jordan 13s that Jordan ever wore on the court for an NBA game, a press release from Sotheby’s noted. 13 of the best menswear looks from Oscars history Following Game 2, Jordan signed and gifted the set of worn shoes to the ball boy in the visitor’s locker room, as he was known to do, according to Sotheby’s. The Air Jordan 13 sneakers starred in a sports memorabilia sale called “Victoriam,” which featured items worn by athletes including Tom Brady, Kobe Bryant and Roger Federer. Several other Jordan items were included in the two-part auction, with a game-worn 1998 Bulls jersey and a pair of 1985 Air Jordan 1s fetching $508,000 and $127,000 respectively. Other top lots included one of Kobe Bryant’s LA Lakers shooting shirts, which sold for over $406,000, and a soccer jersey, worn by the late Pelé on his debut for the New York Cosmos in 1975, that sold fetched over $177,000.

1,2024-08-04 07:36:36.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-04 05:09:50.000,The surreal facades of America's strip clubs,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/francois-prost-gentlemens-club/index.html,2023-03-06 14:13:40.000,"Some people travel the world in search of adventure, while others seek out natural wonders, cultural landmarks or culinary experiences. But French photographer François Prost was looking for something altogether different during his recent road trip across America: strip clubs. From Miami to Los Angeles, Prost’s latest book “Gentlemen’s Club” charts his route across the US via nearly 150 strip clubs with names like Pleasures, Temptations and Cookies N’ Cream. There isn’t a single nude woman to be seen, however, as Prost’s camera was exclusively trained on the buildings themselves — and specifically their often-colorful facades. Over the course of five weeks in 2019 he traversed over 6,000 miles, with the resulting photos capturing everything from the pastel hues of Florida’s Club Pink Pussycat to venues hiding in plain sight in the country’s more religious states. “I’d divide these venues into two types: One is very integrated into the public landscape, and one is a bit more hidden and dodgy,” Prost said, speaking to CNN on a video call and email. The first type, he added, could be found in “very American” settings, such as “around amusement parks and fast food and malls.” The latter venues, however, would sometimes look indistinguishable from any store in a strip mall. Prost said he found many such establishments along the Bible Belt, a socially conservative region in the country’s south. He was especially keen to explore the area due to the apparent contrast between the prevalence of strip clubs and what he describes in his book as “conservatism and extreme puritanism.” Prost insisted that he had little interest in the interiors or services of the strip clubs, which he always visited during the day. Instead, he hoped to learn more about American culture by creating objective, documentary-style photographs of establishments sitting at the intersection of sex, gender and commerce. Documenting changing attitudes toward sex through the lens of architecture, he added that the series was primarily of a landscape photography project. Artful photos inside Houston's ONYX strip club tell a story of beauty and confidence “The prism of this theme of strip club facades became a way of studying and trying to understand the country,” he wrote in “Gentlemen’s Club,” photographs from which will feature in an exhibition in Tokyo in March. ”(‘Gentlemen’s Club’ is) an objective panorama of dominant opinions and gender and the sexualization of the feminine image.” The genesis of Prost’s project dates back to his 2018 series, “After Party,” which focused on the flamboyant facades of French nightclubs. He said that people frequently commented that the buildings’ exteriors looked as though they had been ripped straight out of American cities, sparking the idea that he should visit the US and extend the project. As he meticulously planned his trip, he was struck not only by the sheer volume of strip clubs in America but that — unlike In Europe — they often demanded to be seen. Hot pink walls, gigantic nude silhouettes and even candy-cane-striped storefronts made no secret of the kind of entertainment provided inside. From Brutalist Boston to Modernist Palm Springs, America's most eye-catching city halls “A good example would be Las Vegas, where strip clubs are everywhere and their signs blink as much as a fast food (restaurant) or casino sign,” Prost said. Miami’s clubs were often painted in vivid, Wes Anderson-esque hues. Other photos show brightly covered venues contrasting with their sparse desert surroundings. If the establishments were open during the day, Prost would enter and ask for permission to take photos in order “to not look suspicious… and explain what my intentions were,” he said. The interiors rarely lived up to the tantalizing promises plastered across the signs outside, but the photographer met a host of characters during his five-week trip, from indifferent bouncers to managers who were thrilled about the project. “Most of the time, people were OK — 99% of them would say yes to a facade picture,” he said, adding they typically wouldn’t mind his presence, as long as he didn’t take photos of patrons or dancers. “Some would think that it was a bit strange, some would be really excited about it and give me their business card to send me the picture when it was done,” he said. Prost said his biggest surprise, however, was how “normalized” strip clubs appeared to be in everyday life. As he reflects in his book, “The relationship that Americans seem to have with strip clubs is quite different to what you see in Europe. Going to a strip club seems to be a lot more normalized … You go as a couple, or amongst friends at night to have fun.” Giant doughnuts and a shoe you can walk into: California's strangest buildings He was struck, for instance, by the fact that so many Las Vegas strip clubs doubled as restaurants — with many boasting happy hour deals, buffets and special discounts for truck drivers or construction workers. “I noticed a few strip clubs that would advertise being a strip club and steakhouse, so you could eat a big piece of meat (while) watching strippers. That is also something that seems very American to me,” he said, adding: “I heard from some people I met in Portland there are even strip clubs (that offer) vegan food.” The facades are littered with jokes like “My sex life is like the Sahara, 2 palms, no dates” and pun-based names like Booby Trap and Bottoms Up. Prost’s documentarian approach heightens the signs’ surreal comedy. But it also doubles as a neutral lens through which viewers can make up their own minds about the objectification of women. By honing in on the faceless dancing bodies of female silhouettes and the quintessential “girls girls girls” signs, “Gentleman’s Club” explores the commodification of women who are, in reality, completely absent in Prost’s works (an observation reflected in the book’s title, which is a phrase that crops up numerous times on signs throughout his photographs). The strip clubs he visited market women as things to be consumed, from the many food-themed names to an advertisement reading, “1,000’s of beautiful girls & three ugly ones.” For his next project, Prost plans to visit Japan to document the nation’s love hotels, which occupy a similar role as strip clubs in some parts of the US: open secrets in a conservative society. But the photographer believes the American establishments he visited say something unique about the country — something that is less about sexuality and more about the American dream. Museum of Sex to open new outpost in Miami What his project has shown him is, he said, this: “As long as you’re successful in terms of business, (it doesn’t matter) if your activity deals with sex.” “Gentlemen’s Club” will be exhibited at Agnes b. Galerie Boutique in Tokyo, Japan, between March 17 and April 15, 2023. The book, published by Fisheye Editions, is available now. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

1,2024-08-04 07:36:36.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-04 05:09:50.000,Here's the real reason to turn on airplane mode when you fly,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/airplane-mode-reasons-why/index.html,2023-04-07 12:52:23.000,"Editor’s Note: The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation. We all know the routine by heart: “Please ensure your seats are in the upright position, tray tables stowed, window shades are up, laptops are stored in the overhead bins and electronic devices are set to flight mode.” Now, the first four are reasonable, right? Window shades need to be up so we can see if there’s an emergency, such as fire. Tray tables need to be stowed and seats upright so we can get out of the row quickly. Laptops can become projectiles in an emergency, as the seat back pockets are not strong enough to contain them. And mobile phones need to be set to flight mode so they can’t cause an emergency for the airplane, right? Well, it depends whom you ask. Aviation navigation and communication relies on radio services, which has been coordinated to minimize interference since the 1920s. The digital technology currently in use is much more advanced than some of the older analog technologies we used even 60 years ago. Research has shown personal electronic devices can emit a signal within the same frequency band as the aircraft’s communications and navigation systems, creating what is known as electromagnetic interference. Half of the world's 10 busiest airports for 2022 are in one country But in 1992, the US Federal Aviation Authority and Boeing, in an independent study, investigated the use of electronic devices on aircraft interference and found no issues with computers or other personal electronic devices during non-critical phases of flight. (Takeoffs and landings are considered the critical phases.) The US Federal Communications Commission also began to create reserved frequency bandwidths for different uses – such as mobile phones and aircraft navigation and communications – so they do not interfere with one another. Governments around the globe developed the same strategies and policies to prevent interference problems with aviation. In the EU, electronic devices have been allowed to stay on since 2014. What's the safest seat on a plane? We asked an aviation expert Why then, with these global standards in place, has the aviation industry continued to ban the use of mobile phones? One of the problems lies with something you may not expect – ground interference. Wireless networks are connected by a series of towers; the networks could become overloaded if passengers flying over these ground networks are all using their phones. The number of passengers that flew in 2021 was over 2.2 billion, and that’s half of what the 2019 passenger numbers were. The wireless companies might have a point here. Of course, when it comes to mobile networks, the biggest change in recent years is the move to a new standard. Current 5G wireless networks – desirable for their higher speed data transfer – have caused concern for many within the aviation industry. Radio frequency bandwidth is limited, yet we are still trying to add more new devices to it. The aviation industry points out that the 5G wireless network bandwidth spectrum is remarkably close to the reserved aviation bandwidth spectrum, which may cause interference with navigation systems near airports that assist with landing the aircraft. Airport operators in Australia and the US have voiced aviation safety concerns linked to 5G rollout, however it appears to have rolled out without such problems in the European Union. Either way, it is prudent to limit mobile phone use on planes while issues around 5G are sorted out. Most airlines now provide customers with Wi-Fi services that are either pay-as-you-go or free. With new Wi-Fi technologies, passengers could theoretically use their mobile phones to make video calls with friends or clients in-flight. On a recent flight, I spoke with a cabin attendant and asked her opinion on phone use during flights. It would be an inconvenience for cabin crew to wait for passengers to finish their call to ask them if they would like any drinks or something to eat, she stated. On an airliner with 200+ passengers, in-flight service would take longer to complete if everyone was making phone calls. For me, the problem with in-flight use of phones is more about the social experience of having 200+ people on a plane, and all potentially talking at once. In a time when disruptive passenger behaviour, including “air rage”, is increasingly frequent, phone use in flight might be another trigger that changes the whole flight experience. Disruptive behaviours take on various forms, from noncompliance to safety requirements such as not wearing seat belts, verbal altercations with fellow passengers and cabin crew, to physical altercations with passengers and cabin crews – typically identified as air rage. In conclusion – in-flight use of phones does not currently impair the aircraft’s ability to operate. But cabin crews may prefer not to be delayed in providing in-flight service to all of the passengers – it’s a lot of people to serve. However, 5G technology is encroaching on the radio bandwidth of aircraft navigation systems; we’ll need more research to answer the 5G question regarding interference with aircraft navigation during landings. Remember that when we are discussing the two most critical phases of flight, takeoffs are optional – but landings are mandatory.

1,2024-08-04 07:36:36.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-04 05:09:50.000,"'I was up to my waist down a hippo's throat.' He survived, and here's his advice",https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/hippo-attack-avoid-survive-paul-templer/index.html,2023-04-12 12:44:43.000,"Paul Templer was living his best life. He was 28 and conducting tours in his native Zimbabwe, with a focus on photographic safaris. He had been away for a few years, including a stint in the British army. But he had returned to Africa’s bush country “and fell back in love with it. The wildlife, the flora, the fauna, the great outdoors, the space – just everything about it. I was at home.” Templer said Zimbabwe’s guide certification program was rigorous, and there was a lot of pride among the guides who passed. He reveled in showing tourists the area’s majestic wildlife – including the water-loving, very territorial hippos. “It was idyllic,” he told CNN Travel. “Life was really, really good – until one day I had a really bad day at the office.” March 9, 1996. A Saturday. Templer learned a good friend who was to lead a canoe safari down the Zambezi River had malaria. He agreed to take his pal’s place. “I loved that stretch of the river. It was an area I know like the back of my hand.” The expedition consisted of six safari clients (four Air France crewmembers and a couple from Germany), three apprentice guides plus Templer. They had three canoes – clients in the first two seats and a guide in the back. Then one apprentice guide was in a one-person safety kayak. And down the famed Zambezi they went. “Things were going the way they were supposed to go. Everyone was having a pretty good time.” Eventually, they came across a pod of about a dozen hippos. That’s not unexpected on the Zambezi, Africa’s fourth-longest river. They weren’t alarmed at first as they were at a safe distance. But “we were getting closer, and I was trying to take evasive action. … The idea was let’s just paddle safely around the hippos.” Templer’s canoe led the way, with the other two canoes and kayak to follow. He pulled into a little channel waiting on the others. But the third canoe had fallen back from the group and was off the planned course. Templer’s not sure how that happened. Suddenly, there’s this big thud. And I see the canoe, like the back of it, catapulted up into the air. Paul Templer “Suddenly, there’s this big thud. And I see the canoe, like the back of it, catapulted up into the air. And Evans, the guide in the back of the canoe, catapulted out of the canoe.” The clients managed to remain in the canoe somehow. “Evans is in the water, and the current is washing Evans toward a mama hippo and her calf 150 meters [490 feet] away. … So I know I’ve got to get him out quickly. I don’t have time to drop my clients off.” He yells to Ben, one of the other guides, to retrieve the clients who were in the canoe that had been attacked. Ben got the clients to safety on a rock in the middle of the river that hippos couldn’t climb. Meanwhile, Templer turned his canoe around to get Evans. The plan was to pull alongside of him and pull him into Templer’s canoe. “I was paddling towards him … getting closer, and I saw this bow wave coming towards me. If you’ve ever seen any of those old movies with a torpedo coming toward a ship, it was kind of like that. I knew it was either a hippo or a really large crocodile coming at me,” he said. “But I also knew that if I slapped the blade of my paddle on water … that’s really loud. And the percussion underwater seems to turn the animals away,” he said. “So I slapped the water, and as it was supposed to do, the torpedo wave stops.” He was getting closer to Evans, but they were also getting closer to the female and calf. “I’m leaning over – it’s kind of a made-for-Hollywood movie – Evans is reaching up. … Our fingers almost touched. And then the water between us just erupted. Happened so fast I didn’t see a thing.” What happened next was nightmarish and surreal. “My world went dark and strangely quiet.” Templer said it took a few seconds to figure out what was going on. “From the waist down, I could feel the water. I could feel I was wet in the river. From my waist up, it was different. I was warm, and it wasn’t wet like the river, but it wasn’t dry either. And it was just incredible pressure on my lower back. I tried to move around; I couldn’t. “I realized I was up to my waist down a hippo’s throat.” There’s a good reason a fully grown hippopotamus can fit a large portion of a fully grown adult in its mouth. Hippos can grow up to 16.5 feet long (5 meters), 5.2 feet tall (1.6 meters) and weigh up to 4.5 tons (4 metric tonnes), according to National Geographic. They sport enormous mouths and can open their strong jaws to 150 degrees. Their teeth might be the most frightening thing of all. Their molars are used for eating plants, but their sharp canines, which might reach 20 inches (51 centimeters), are for defense and fighting. Their bite is almost three times stronger than that of a lion. One bite from a hippo can possibly cut a human body in half. They’re found naturally in various parts sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in East and Southern Africa, living in or near rivers and other water sources. (And they are an invasive species in Colombia thanks to escapees from drug lord Pablo Escobar’s menagerie). Hippos are very territorial and might aggressively attack any animal encroaching on their territory, including hyenas, lions and crocodiles. They also kill people. That we know for sure. Many internet sources say around 500 a year, but an exact figure is still uncertain because some attacks and deaths come in very remote regions and don’t get reported. “The question I get asked the most when people find out I study hippos is: ‘Is it true hippos kill more people than any animal?’ Rebecca Lewison, conservation ecologist and associate professor at San Diego State University, told CNN Travel in an email interview. How to survive a cobra bite -- or better yet, avoid one entirely “I’m not entirely sure where that started but … there is no authority or reliable data. People are surprised that hippos kill people. They look slow, and they are mostly in water. There are some nonfatal interactions, but people (or hippos) tend to fare badly from interactions.” Dr. Philip Muruthi, chief scientist and vice president of species conservation and science of the African Wildlife Foundation, said the AWF doesn’t have a credible source on the number of attacks or fatalities either. While more stats need to be collected, one study found that the probability of being killed by a hippopotamus attack is in the range of 29% to 87% – higher than that of a grizzly bear attack at 4.8%, shark attack at 22.7% and crocodile attack at 25%. Those were rather bad odds of survival working against Templer. “I’m guessing I was wedged so far down its throat it must have been uncomfortable because he spat me out. So I burst to the surface, sucked a lungful of fresh air and I came face to face with Evans, the guide who I was trying to rescue. And I said, ‘We got to get out of here!’ ” So once again, I’m up to my waist down the hippo’s throat. But this time, my legs are trapped but my hands are free. Paul Templer But Evans was in serious trouble. Templer started swimming back for him “and I was just moving in for your classic lifesaver’s hold when – WHAM! – I got hit from below. So once again, I’m up to my waist down the hippo’s throat. But this time my legs are trapped but my hands are free.” He tried to go for his gun, but he was being thrashed around so much he couldn’t grab it. The hippo – which turned out to be an older, aggressive male – spat Templer out a second time. “This time when I come to the surface I look around, there’s no sign of Evans.” Templer assumed Evans had been rescued, and he tried to escape himself. “I’m making pretty good progress and I’m swimming along there and I come up for the stroke and swimming freestyle and I look under my arm – and until my dying day I’ll remember this – there’s this hippo charging in towards me with his mouth wide open bearing in before he scores a direct hit.” This time, Templer was sideways in the hippo’s mouth, legs dangling out one side of the mouth, shoulders and head on the other side of its mouth. “And then he just goes berserk. … When hippos are fighting, the way they fight is they try to tear apart and just destroy whatever it is they’re attacking,” Templer said. “For me, fortunately everything was happening in slow motion. So when he’d go under water, I’d hold my breath. When we were on the surface, I would take a deep breath and I would try to hold onto tusks that were boring through me” to stop from being ripped apart. Templer said one of the clients watching the horror later described it like a “vicious dog trying to rip apart a rag doll.” He figures the whole attack took about three and a half minutes. Meanwhile, apprentice guide Mack in the safety kayak – “showing incredible bravery, risking his life to save mine – pulls his boat in inches from my face.” Templer managed to grab a handle on the kayak, and “Mack dragged me to the relative safety of this rock.” The expedition was still in one hell of a mess, though. People living near hippo territory are more likely victims of attacks than tourists, said Lewison. “Most of the attacks happen in the water, but because hippos raid crops on farms, there are also attacks on people trying to protect their crops. There are some tourists, but largely the attacks are happening to local residents,” Lewison said. Human encroachment from Africa’s booming population makes matters worse, increasing the chances of deadly interactions, she said. You encounter a bear in the wild. Do you know what to do next? Despite the encounters gone bad, sub-Saharan Africa depends on hippos. “Hippos are important ecosystem engineers of the ecology of freshwater areas they inhabit. This is through nutrient recycling from dung (they consume large amounts of vegetation),” Muruthi said. “Hippos attack not to eat people, but to get them the hell away from them,” Lewison said. “I don’t think hippos are particularly aggressive, but I think when under pressure, they attack.” Back on the rock in the Zambezi, Templer asked Mack where Evans was. Mack said, “He’s gone, man, he’s just gone.” Templer knew he needed to come up with a plan to get them off the rock and to the riverbank, but “first I needed to settle myself down.” He assessed the situation: One man missing. The first aid kit, radio and gun all gone. Six scared clients, two canoes and one paddle left. And his own body was shattered. “My left foot was especially bad; it looked as if someone had tried to beat a hole through it with a hammer.” He couldn’t move his arms. One arm from elbow down was “crushed to a pulp.” Blood was bubbling out of his mouth. They realized his lung was punctured. Mack rolled Templer over and could see a gaping hole in his back and plugged it with Saran Wrap from a plate of snacks. Templer made the call: No matter the risk, they had to get off that rock. He was loaded into a canoe. Ben paddled. The hippo kept bumping the canoe. He went from being terrified to calm on that ride back. He described “a profound spiritual experience in which I had this incredible sense of peace and realization this was my moment of choice. Like do I go, or do I stay? Do I close my eyes and drift off, or do I fight my way through this and stick around?” It was so intense I thought I was going to die, and when I didn’t, I kind of wished I would. Paul Templer on the pain after the attack “I chose to stick around, and as soon as I made that choice, it was more pain than I could ever imagine I could endure. It was so intense I thought I was going to die, and when I didn’t, I kind of wished I would.” Ben and Templer made it out of the river, but without finding Evans. His body was found three days later. They concluded he had drowned because he didn’t have any signs of animal attack on him. “Evans did nothing wrong. The fact that he died was purely a tragedy.” Meanwhile, some people on shore had realized something was wrong in the river. A well-trained Zimbabwe rescue team was able to safely ferry everyone else off the rock. “And that was my bad day at the office.” Templer was out of the river but not out of the woods. It took eight hours to drive him to the nearest hospital. In a month’s time, he had several major surgeries. He thought he would lose one leg and both arms. His surgeon didn’t think he’d live. But not only did the surgeon save Templer’s life, he saved his legs and one arm. The other arm, however, was beyond salvation. If you're attacked by an alligator, here's how to fight for your life He realized that in the ICU when he woke up and was feeling for his left hand. It was gone. “I just remember feeling devastated. I spent my whole life being active and it was almost more than I could bare.” But then he was flooded with relief to realize his right arm and legs had been saved. For the next month, he was “emotionally all over the map.” He got physical and occupational therapy in Zimbabwe and then more in the United Kingdom. He got a prosthesis “and then just started trying to get back to life.” Templer, Muruthi and Lewison all say safe outings start with education – and avoiding trouble in the first place. “Hippos have no interest in dealing with people. Stay away from them, and they will leave you alone. They are not hunting humans,” Lewison said. “Do not get close to them,” Muruthi said. “They don’t want any intrusion. … They’re not predators; it’s by accident if they’re injuring people.” Want close-up views and photos of the creatures? Instead of venturing too close, invest in good binoculars and telephoto camera lenses. Follow the rules. If you are a tourist, and it says ‘Stay in your vehicle,’ then stay in your vehicle. Philip Muruthi on avoiding hippo attacks Do not walk along well-worn hippo paths, stay close to your group and don’t approach them from behind, Muruthi said. “Follow the rules. If you are a tourist, and it says ‘Stay in your vehicle,’ then stay in your vehicle. And even when you’re in your vehicle, don’t drive it right to the animal.” Muruthi also advised that your party make some noise in areas known for hippos. “It’s good for them to know you’re around.” “Hippos usually come out of water late in the evening and at night to forage, so avoid trekking along the river at that time,” Muruthi said. Also stay on high alert during the dry season when food is scarce. Get to know the signs of disturbed hippos, Muruthi advised, in case you wander too closely. An agitated one will open its mouth wide and yawn as aggressive display. Also watch for a head thrown back, shaking of the head, grunting and snorting. “These are signs you should have left already!” Muruthi said. If you’ve attracted unwanted attention, Muruthi said to always remember you cannot outrun a hippo. They may look sluggish, but they can run 30 mph (almost 43 kph). Instead, you should try to climb a tree or find an obstacle to put between you and the hippo such as a rock or anthill. Muruthi, Lewison and Templer all said never stay between a hippo and the water. If it’s charging you, run parallel to the water source. As with so many other protective female animals, never get between a mama hippo and her young, Templer said. He was alone, deep in the moutains. And a rattlesnake just bit him. What if you’re in a small watercraft? “Typically, if a hippo is going to be attacking, you’ll see it coming way before. There will be that bow wave. … If you slap the water, the percussion 99.9 times out of 100 will turn the hippo,” Templer said. “If you’re in a canoe and a hippo knocks you in the water, get away from the canoe. The hippo is going for this big shape, getting it off its territory.” It’s also safer to view hippos on the water in a larger vessel, which the animal would have a harder time capsizing, Muruthi said. Unlike attacks by some other wild animals, humans are almost defenseless once an attack by a large hippo begins. “Once attacked, there is nothing you can do,” Muruthi said. “Fight for dear life and watch for any chance to escape.” He said you could try to poke at the eyes or any spot that might inflict unexpected pain. But given the size just of a hippo head, even that’s a tall order. Hippos typically hole punch you, so there isn’t much you can do if they get hold of you. Rebecca Lewison “Hippos typically hole punch you, so there isn’t much you can do if they get hold of you,” Lewison said. Based on his attack, Templer said try not to panic “when dragged underwater. Remember to suck in air if on the surface.” Another hippo attack survivor in this National Geographic video also was able to conserve her breath. She also grabbed the hippo’s snout, and one expert in the video theorizes that might have startled the hippo into letting her go. Two years after that attack, Templer said that he and a team made the longest recorded descent of the Zambezi River to date. It took three months and covered 1,600 miles (2,575 kilometers). How did Templer find the resilience to reclaim his life? After a particularly rough day trying to maneuver in a wheelchair, he said that his surgeon told him: “You’re the sum of your choices. You’re exactly who, what and where you choose to be in life.” Templer said he focused on what’s possible vs. what he’s lost. “If you look for what’s possible, it generally is.” Templer later moved to United States; got married to the sister of a journalist on the record-setting Zambezi trip; wrote the book “What’s Left of Me”; and is a speaker. Should people be afraid to even go on safari – especially in hippo areas – after learning of a harrowing story like Templer’s? Muruthi said go, but go smartly. Be sure to get advice from professional tour guides – and then follow their guidance, Muruthi said. “In Kenya, for example, contact the Kenya Professional Safari Guides Association,” he said. Templer said his attack was an “anomaly,” and he doesn’t want anyone to be dissuaded by what happened on his 1996 river run. “My biggest counsel would be: Absolutely go and do it. But hook yourself up with someone who knows what they’re doing out there. But by all means, go out … and experience it.” © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Get the latest news in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments. He’d spent years backpacking around the world, and Japanese traveler Daisuke Kajiyama was finally ready to return home to pursue his long-held dream of opening up a guesthouse. In 2011, Kajiyama arrived back in Japan with his Israeli partner Hila, who he met in Nepal, and the pair set about finding the perfect location for their future venture. However, there were a couple of major stumbling blocks in their way. To start with, Kajiyama had very little money to speak of after years of globetrotting around destinations like Korea, Taiwan, India, Nepal, Guatemala, Cuba and Canada. He also happened to have his heart set on a traditional Japanese house, typically known as kominka, which are usually passed down over generations. “I wanted to have a traditional house in the countryside,” Kajiyama tells CNN Travel, explaining that he was determined to find two houses located next to each other, so that he and Hila could live in one, while the other would be a guesthouse that they’d run together. “I had a vision.” This US couple bought and renovated a 14th-century Italian home When he was unable to find anything that met his requirements, Kajiyama decided to shift his search to include the growing number of abandoned homes in the country. As younger people ditch rural areas in pursuit of jobs in the city, Japan’s countryside is becoming filled with “ghost” houses, or “akiya.” According to the Japan Policy Forum, there were 61 million houses and 52 million households in Japan in 2013, and with the country’s population expected to decline from 127 million to about 88 million by 2065, this number is likely to increase. Kajiyama was driving around Tamatori, a small village located in the Shizuoka prefecture, between Kyoto and Tokyo, surrounded by green tea plantations and rice fields, when he came across an elderly woman farming, and decided to approach her. “I said ‘Do you know if there are any empty houses around here?’ And she just pointed,” he recalls. He looked over at the area that she was signaling to and spotted two neglected houses side by side – a former green tea factory and an old farmer’s home – located close to a river. Both properties had been uninhabited for at least seven years and needed a huge amount of work. Kajiyama asked the woman to contact the owner to find out if they’d be interested in selling. “The owner said that no one could live there, as it was abandoned,” he says. “But he didn’t say ‘no.’ Everybody was always saying ‘no.’ But he didn’t. So I felt there was a small chance.” Expats buy Japanese country house for a song and get way more than they bargained for Kajiyama returned to visit the houses around five times, before going to visit the owner himself to negotiate an agreement that would see him use the old green tree factory as a home, and convert the farmer’s house into the guesthouse he’d always envisioned. While he was keen to purchase both of the homes, he explains that the traditions around home ownership in Japan mean that he is unable to do so until it’s passed down to the son of the current owner. “They said ‘if you take all the responsibility yourself, you can take it.’ So we made an agreement on paper,” he says. Both he and Hila were aware that they had a lot of work ahead of them, but the couple, who married in 2013, were thrilled to be one step closer to having their own guesthouse in an ideal spot. “It’s a very nice location,” says Kajiyama. “It’s close to the city, but it’s really countryside. Also people still live here and go to work [in the city]. “The house is also in front of the river, so when you go to sleep you can hear the sound of the water.” According to Kajiyama, the process of clearing the house, which is around 90 years old, before beginning the renovation works was one of the hardest parts of the process, simply because there was so much stuff to sort through. However, he was able to repurpose some of the items. During the first year, he spent a lot of time connecting with locals, gaining knowledge about the home, and helping the local farmers with farming for the first year or so. Although he wasn’t hugely experienced with renovation work, he had spent some time farming and completing building while he was backpacking, and had also taken odd jobs fixing peoples homes. He completed much of the work on the guesthouse himself, replacing the floors and adding in a toilet, which he says was a wedding present from his parents, at a cost of around $10,000. “I’m not really a professional,” he says.” I like to do carpentry and I enjoy creating things, but I have no experience in my background. “From my several years of backpacking, I saw so many interesting buildings, so many houses of interesting shapes and I’ve been collecting those in my brain.” Kajiyama was determined to keep the house as authentic as possible by using traditional materials. He saved money by collecting traditional wood from building companies who were in the process of breaking down traditional houses. “They need to spend the money to throw it away,” he explains. “But for me, some of the stuff is like treasure. So I would go and take the material that I wanted. “The house is a very, very old style,” he says. “So it wouldn’t look nice if I brought in more modern materials. It’s totally authentic.” He explains that very little work had previously been done to the house, which is quite unusual for a home built so many years ago. “It’s totally authentic,” he says. “Usually, with traditional houses, some renovations are made to the walls, because the insulation is not so strong. So you lose the style.” He says he received some financial support from the government, which meant he was able to bring in a carpenter and also benefited from Japan’s working holiday program, which allows travelers to work in exchange for food and board, when he needed extra help. After doing some research into Japanese guesthouse permits, he discovered that one of the simplest ways to acquire one would be to register the property as an agriculture guesthouse. As the area is filled with bamboo forests, this seemed like a no-brainer, and Kajiyama decided to learn everything he could about bamboo farming so that he could combine the two businesses. “This is how I started farming,” he says. In 2014, two years after they began working on the house, the couple were finally able to welcome their first guests. “It was a beautiful feeling,” says Kajiyama. “Of course, this was my dream. But people really appreciate that it was abandoned and I brought it back to life.” He says that hosting guests from all over the world has helped him to stay connected to his former life as a backpacker. “I stay in one place, but people come to me and I feel like I’m traveling,” he says. “Today, it’s Australia, tomorrow it’s the UK and next week South Africa and India. “People come from different places and they invite me to join them for dinner, so sometimes I join someone’s family life.” Sadly, Hila passed away from cancer in 2022. Kajiyama stresses that his beloved wife played a huge part in helping him achieve his dream of having a guesthouse and says he couldn’t have done it without her. “We were really together,” he adds. “She created this place with me. Without her it would not have been like this.” While the three-bedroom guesthouse, which measures around 80 square meters, has been open for around eight years, Kajiyama is still working on it, and says he has no idea when he’ll be finished. “It’s never ending,” he admits. “I’m halfway, I feel. It is beautiful already. But it started off abandoned, so it needs more details. And I’m getting better at creating, so I need time to do it.” He explains that he’s unable to complete work on the home while guests are there. And while the property is closed during the winter, he spends two months as a bamboo farmer and usually spends a month traveling, which doesn’t leave him much time for renovations. “Sometimes I don’t do anything,” he admits. Yui Valley, which offers activities such as bamboo weaving workshops, has helped to bring many travelers to the village of Tamatori over the years. “Most of the guests come after Tokyo, and it’s such a contrast,” he says. “They are really happy to share the nature and the tradition in our house. “Most people have dreamed of coming to Japan for a long time and they have a very short time here. “So they have such a beautiful energy. I’m happy to host in this way and join their holiday time. It’s very special [for me].” Kajiyama estimates that he’s spent around $40,000 on the renovation work so far, and if the feedback from guests, and locals, is anything to go by, it seems to have been money well spent. “People appreciate what I’ve done,” he adds. “So that makes me feel special.” As for Hiroko, the woman who pointed out the house to him over a decade ago, Kajiyama says she’s stunned at the transformation, and is amazed at how many international travelers are coming to Tamatori to stay at Yui Valley. “She cannot believe how much more beautiful it is [now],” he says. “She didn’t think it was going to be like this. So she really appreciates it. She says ‘thank you’ a lot.” Yui Valley, 1170 Okabecho Tamatori, Fujieda, Shizuoka 421-1101, Japan © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Due to its remoteness and short summer season, Mongolia has long been a destination overlooked by travelers. But as the country moves to further open up to tourism by easing its entry conditions for international visitors and upgrading its infrastructure, 2023 might just be the best time yet to get there. Here are 10 reasons travelers should start planning their long-dreamed-of Mongolia visit now. With the government of Mongolia declaring 2023 through 2025 the “Years to Visit Mongolia,” citizens from an additional 34 countries can now visit the country visa-free through the end of 2025. The addition of several European countries, including Denmark, France, Greece, Italy, Norway, Spain, and the UK, as well as Australia and New Zealand, now brings the total number of countries and territories on the visa-exempt list to 61. The full list is here. After years of delays, a pandemic and several controversies, the newly built Chinggis Khaan International Airport finally opened in the summer of 2021. With the ability to handle approximately 3 million passengers a year (double that of the old airport), the addition of 500 new aircraft parking spaces and the infrastructure to support an increase in domestic as well as budget flights, the airport is a welcome addition to the country’s efforts to grow tourism. Budget flights to Hong Kong from EZNIS Airways have been relaunched since the airport’s opening, and talks to resume direct flights to the United States are reportedly underway. The recently opened Chinggis Khaan Museum offers a beautiful, fresh look at Mongolia’s tumultuous history. With more than 10,000 artifacts spanning over 2,000 years, the museum explores the history of the Mongols and the empire they created – and eventually lost. The museum’s artifacts are presented over eight floors, with six permanent and two temporary exhibition halls. Guided tours are offered in English every Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. free of charge. When most people think of Mongolia, music festivals and conservation-focused art installations in the heart of one of the world’s largest deserts are the last things to come to mind. But that’s all changing thanks to festivals like Playtime, Spirit of Gobi, INTRO Electronic Music Festival and the Kharkhorum 360 Visual Art & Music Experience. Placing international bands, DJs, and musicians from around the world alongside Mongolia’s eclectic mix of rappers, bands and folk singers, the country just might be one of the world’s most underrated places for festival lovers. The annual Naadam event has always been a great reason to visit Mongolia, but now that the festival has just celebrated its 100 year anniversary, 2023 is as good a time as ever to attend. While the festival’s origins are rooted in the days of Genghis Khan, when he used horse racing, wrestling and archery competitions to keep his warriors in shape between battles, Naadam only officially became a national holiday 100 years ago. Today, the festival – held in Ulaanbaatar at the National Sports Stadium, has a few more bells and whistles than it did during the days of the Great Khan. A seat at July 11’s opening ceremony is always one of the hardest tickets to score in town. Mounted archery is seeing a resurgence in Mongolia thanks to guys like Altankhuyag Nergui, one of the most accomplished archers in the sport and his archery academy, Namnaa. Here, locals learn the fundamentals of Mongolian archery before mounting a horse and taking their new found skills to another level. In the summer months, students and academy members put on weekly shows for interested spectators. The academy also offers day-long training sessions for those wanting to try this intense sport. Speaking of giving life to Mongolia’s most ancient traditions, the resurrection of Mongol bichig, or the traditional Mongolian script written from top to bottom and read from left to right, has also seen a major resurgence in recent years. Visit the Erdenesiin Khuree Mongolian Calligraphy Center in Karakorum to learn from master calligraphist Tamir Samandbadraa Purev about this important cultural heritage. And, while you’re there, browse the yurts filled with Tamir’s works. Pair the release of Husqvarna’s new Norden 901 Expedition motorbike with Nomadic Off-Road’s newly announced Eagle Hunter Tour, and you have one of the fastest adventures in Mongolia. The tour takes six riders 1,700 kilometers from Ulaanbaatar to Bayan-Ulgii, where riders eventually meet their hosts, Mongolia’s famous eagle hunters. The only thing faster than this adventure is the rate at which Nomadic Off-Road’s tours sell out. Capturing the art of the last eagle hunters of Mongolia Professional musher Joel Rauzy has been leading dogsledding tours across the frozen Lake Khuvsgul for 18 years. With fewer crowds, lower hotel rates and the chance to see one of the largest freshwater lakes in the world completely frozen over, winter in Mongolia is something else to see and experience. Rauzy’s company, Wind of Mongolia, offers tours of the lake, where each person is assigned their own sled and dogs for the journey. Following Rauzy’s lead, mushers will make a loop of the lake. Activities include ice fishing, while travelers stay in winterized yurts and spend time with nomadic families along the journey. Nestled in the heart of Selenge province on the Yeruu River, Yeruu Lodge is the brainchild of Norwegian founder Eirik Gulsrud Johnsen, who first visited Mongolia in 2017. With a minimal Scandinavian-style restaurant and dining area, a handful of fully kitted out yurts for guests to stay in, two pétanque courts, kayaks, a driving range, mountain bikes and a yoga area, the lodge is a destination for nature lovers. Completely off-grid, the lodge runs off solar panels, uses of thermal heating, and all of the property’s water comes from an on-property well and is recycled after use. Additionally, all glass, metal and plastic used at the lodge is also recycled, and food waste is turned into compost used to grow vegetables, berries and herbs onsite. The lodge is set to open in April 2023. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved. CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."
1,2024-08-04 07:36:36.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-04 05:09:50.000,The most beautiful sections of China's Great Wall,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/china-beautiful-great-wall-sections-cmd/index.html,2023-09-18 02:57:08.000,"Editor’s Note: Monthly Ticket is a CNN Travel series that spotlights some of the most fascinating topics in the travel world. In September, we’re celebrating superlatives as we look at some of the world’s biggest, tallest and most expensive attractions and destinations. Having lived in Beijing for almost 12 years, I’ve had plenty of time to travel widely in China. I’ve visited more than 100 cities, not to mention countless towns and villages throughout the mainland’s 31 provinces. Looking back, I’ve come to realize it was my frequent visits to different parts of the Great Wall in Beijing that were a driving force behind my desire to explore the rest of the country and, along with it, the many sections of wall that lie outside the capital’s boundaries. Work on the Great Wall began more than 2,500 years ago, its origins dating back to China’s Spring and Autumn Period of around 770 BCE to 476 BCE. Various sections were added in subsequent eras as competing dynasties and factions sought to exert their control. Work eventually stopped in the 17th century. What's it like to walk the entire length of China's Great Wall? Though not a single, unbroken structure, the wall spans over 21,000 kilometers, winding through 15 provinces, 97 prefectures and 404 counties. And while certain sections have been incredibly popular among tourists, many parts have slipped into obscurity, disrepair and sometimes oblivion. Whether you’re planning to visit the Great Wall for the first time or the 50th, the following destinations are sure to make your trip to China even more worthwhile. (Check out the above video for dramatic aerial footage of some of these amazing sites.) The Great Wall is not simply a brick and mortar bulwark; in certain places, towers on jagged mountain peaks, fortress towns or even wide rivers count as sections of “wall.” The Turtle City, built in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) as part of the Great Wall’s “Yellow River Defense Line,” was completed in 1608 and was home to around 2,000 infantrymen and 500 cavalry units during peak use. Today, this fortress city is located in the Sitan Township of Jingtai County in north central Gansu province. While there aren’t many real turtles in the “Turtle City,” the garrison town got its nickname due to its unique shape. The south gate acts as the head and the west and east gates as the flippers. The town’s oval wall is the body, while the north gate acts as its tail. As one of the most well-preserved and truly authentic walled cities left in China today, it’s definitely worth your time. Staying in the Jingtai County center is recommended. The ancient city is only a 30-minute cab ride from your lodgings, so you can visit whenever the light is best for photos. When in Jingtai, try local specialties such as the five Buddha tofu and the Jingtai cold mixed noodles – both are spicy vegetarian dishes. A walk through the sprawling night market in Jingtai County People’s Square, which boasts more than 50 snack stalls, is also recommended for adventurous foodies. Regional Chinese food: 8 lesser-known cuisines worth trying Getting there: Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu province, has a major international airport and high-speed train connections from many cities in China. The drive to Yongtai Turtle City from downtown Lanzhou takes about 2.5 hours (195 kilometers). From Lanzhou Zhongchuan Airport, it’s only 1.5 hours (125 kilometers). Mutianyu and Jiankou are two parts of the same Stone Dragon – two contiguous sections of the Great Wall that together stretch for roughly 25 kilometers along Beijing’s mountaintops. Historical records show that millions of men spent centuries constructing the Great Wall. Stand atop the wall at either Mutianyu or Jiankou, and you’ll begin to comprehend the gravity of this statement. These two sections are arguably the two most classic examples of Ming Dynasty Great Wall surviving today, and climbing either is guaranteed to be a life-changing experience. Mutianyu is the best portion of the “tourist wall.” Restored in the 1980s, it’s very commercial but also superbly beautiful. Visitors not up for the hike can take a cable car to the top. Off-the-radar destinations every visitor to China should consider To the west of Mutianyu, Jiankou is colloquially known as the “wild wall” – no ticket needed and not commercialized. That being said, as of 2020, hiking at Jiankou has become somewhat frowned upon by the local government because of safety concerns. Mutianyu and Jiankou are less than a 90-minute drive (without traffic) from downtown Beijing, yet it’s highly recommended to enjoy a night in the countryside if time allows. Jiankou can be accessed via Xizhazi village; if dates align, you might even be able to spend a few days with William Lindesay, world-renowned Great Wall historian, and his wonderful family at The Barracks, their wall-side courtyard home. For lodgings around Mutianyu, The Brickyard is a superbly comfortable choice. In fall and spring, shades of the wall’s gray brick contrast with nature’s vibrant colors. Peak autumn foliage and spring cherry blossoms provide stunning backdrops for photos. For winter sports enthusiasts, there’s skiing and skating next to the Wall at locations not far from Mutianyu. Getting to Mutianyu: Restrictions on applying for temporary driving licenses in China were relaxed in September 2019, so renting a car as a foreign tourist is entirely possible. (International driving licenses are not accepted in China.) You can also hire a car with a driver for the day or take the Mutianyu Special Tourism Bus from the Dongzhimen Wai Bus Station. Getting to Jiankou: Renting a car or booking private transport is recommended. As Xizhazi is a small village, buses are scarce so it can take up to five hours to get there by public transport, as opposed to 90 minutes by car. Bataizi village sits just inside the Motianling section of the Great Wall and is home to the ruins of a Gothic church built in 1876 under the direction of a German missionary. The church has been damaged and repaired numerous times in its nearly 150-year history; the bell tower is the only part still standing. The juxtaposition of its ruins against the rammed-earth Great Wall makes Bataizi a unique place to spend a morning or afternoon. China's best new outdoor attractions After finishing your hike along the wall and visiting the church ruins, drop in to the village’s “new” church to say hello to Father Pan; if you speak Chinese, he can answer any questions about the village’s long connection with Catholicism. Besides Bataizi, Datong should also be on your tourist map; visiting the Yungang Grottoes (a UNESCO world heritage site) and the Hengshan Hanging Temple will make your trip even more memorable. Late summer is an ideal time to visit Bataizi, as you’ll see a wonderful contrast between the Great Wall and the lush green hills. Getting there: Bataizi village is 80 kilometers west of Datong, one of Shanxi province’s largest and most famous cities. Zuoyun County is only 22 kilometers away from Bataizi – about a 35-minute drive. Datong is easily accessible by plane or high-speed train from other cities in China; a taxi from downtown Datong to Bataizi should cost roughly 300 yuan (about $43). Alternatively, you can make your way to Zuoyun County by bus then hop in a taxi. In Datong, luxury seekers will want to head for the five-star Yunzhong Traditional Courtyard Hotel. Zuoyun County has one hotel that can accept foreigners: Zuoyun Jinshan International Hotel. Both can be found on popular hotel booking sites. As the locals say, Laoniuwan is where the Great Wall and the mighty Yellow River shake hands. The Laoniuwan Fortress was built in 1467, while the most famous tower of the Great Wall in this area, Wanghe Tower (literally meaning river-watching tower), was constructed in 1544. Laoniuwan village is located in Pianguan County, part of Xinzhou city in Shanxi province, just across the river from Inner Mongolia. Late summer or early fall is a great time to visit, as you’ll avoid the potentially dangerous mountain roads during spring rainstorms, or being uncomfortably cold in a place without great infrastructure. Along the Great Wall, there are only a few places where it meets bodies of water; of all those, this is the most stunning. A boat ride along the river is highly recommended. You’ll be able to soak in the natural beauty of the Yellow River Gorge while marveling at the steadfast resolve of these ancient architects. Swell life: China's surf scene is heating up Getting there: Laoniuwan is difficult to get to by public transportation. The best option is to rent or book a car to take you from Datong to Laoniuwan via Bataizi – this way, you’ll be able to see two incredible locations along the Great Wall in one trip. Pianguan is the nearest city, about one hour away. Pianguan does not have a train station or an airport. The only option is to arrive by bus. Shuozhou, 140 kilometers from Laoniuwan, has an airport opening later this year. Construction on the Great Wall in Simatai began in 1373. It was expanded and reinforced periodically throughout the Ming Dynasty. The Fairy Tower is one of the best-known towers of the wall at Simatai but also one of the least visited due to how difficult it is to access. Instead, aim to take in incredible views of the Fairy Tower from Wangjing Tower (just a few hundred meters away). It’s a journey that will satiate even the most adventurous hikers, yet can be done without any ropes, ladders or other essential safety gear. As with a visit to Mutianyu/Jiankou, this section of wall is guaranteed to deliver stunning views any time of year. My only suggestion is to wait for a clear day (usually visibility is great the day after it rains or snows), as the view from Wangjing Tower is unobstructed in every direction. The hike to the Fairy Tower will leave you in awe of the Northern Barbarians’ supposed determination to reach the capital; the mountains are nearly impassable on foot, let alone by horse, with sheer cliff faces on either side. It makes for absolutely world-class hiking and an interesting history lesson. Five-star lodgings are available at Hobo Farm; they also have an incredible restaurant that serves delicious Western and Chinese fare. For 4.5 star lodgings with a lower price tag, try Yatou’s Homestay. Both can be found on major hotel booking sites. Getting there: Both the Fairy Tower and Wangjing Tower should be accessed via Tangjiazhai village, located in Beijing’s Miyun district. Tangjiazhai village is 140 kilometers from downtown Beijing, depending on your route. Booking a private car from the city is probably the most time-effective way to get there. You can also take a high-speed train from Beijing Station to Miyun district and switch to a bus or taxi from there. Constructed during the reign of Emperor Jiajing (1507-1567), this single-wall section stands seven meters tall in some spots – no small feat considering it was made by piling stones. It’s located just across the road from the town of Dushikou, in Chicheng in Hebei province. The piled-stone wall at Dushikou is unique, as many other sections of the Great Wall close to Beijing were constructed using kiln-fired bricks. Dushikou is best visited in the summer, specifically July and August, when the rolling hills of the surrounding grasslands are peak green. Cool evenings make for perfect outdoor barbecue/bonfire weather. You’ll be able to find clean and comfortable farmhouse lodgings in Dushikou town; alternatively, Chicheng, 45 minutes away, has a range of hotels to choose from. Lamb skewers and roast leg of lamb are specialties in these parts, as this part of Hebei is very close to the border with Inner Mongolia. Noodle lovers should also try the local oat noodles, which are delicious. Getting there: Thanks to all the infrastructure built for the 2022 Winter Olympics, the drive to Dushikou has been shortened by almost two hours. If you prefer not to drive, hop on a bus to Chicheng from the Liuliqiao Transport Hub in Beijing and take a 45-minute taxi ride to Dushikou. Note that public transportation will take one or two hours longer than private car. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

Related gallery Inside 2022's 'CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute' Online voters selected her from among this year’s Top 10 CNN Heroes. Cheboi’s nonprofit, TechLit Africa, has provided thousands of students across rural Kenya with access to donated, upcycled computers — and the chance at a brighter future. Cheboi accepted the award with her mother, who she said “worked really hard to educate us.” At the beginning of her acceptance speech, Cheboi and her mother sang a song onstage that she explained had a special meaning when she was growing up. As CNN Hero of the Year, Cheboi will receive $100,000 to expand her work. She and the other top 10 CNN Heroes honored at Sunday’s gala all receive a $10,000 cash award and, for the first time, additional grants, organizational training and support from The Elevate Prize Foundation through a new collaboration with CNN Heroes. Nelly will also be named an Elevate Prize winner, which comes with a $300,000 grant and additional support worth $200,000 for her nonprofit. Cheboi grew up in poverty in Mogotio, a rural township in Kenya. “I know the pain of poverty,” said Cheboi, 29. “I never forgot what it was like with my stomach churning because of hunger at night.” A hard-working student, Cheboi received a full scholarship to Augustana College in Illinois in 2012. She began her studies there with almost no experience with computers, handwriting papers and struggling to transcribe them onto a laptop. Related article This CNN Hero upcycles old computers to open new worlds for young Kenyans Everything changed in her junior year, though, when Cheboi took a programming course required for her mathematics major. “When I discovered computer science, I just fell in love with it. I knew that this is something that I wanted to do as my career, and also bring it to my community,” she told CNN. Many basic computer skills were still a steep learning curve, however. Cheboi remembers having to practice touch-typing for six months before she could pass a coding interview. Touch-typing is a skill that is now a core part of the TechLit curriculum. “I feel so accomplished seeing kids that are 7 years old touch-typing, knowing that I just learned how to touch-type less than five years ago,” she said. Once she had begun working in the software industry, Cheboi soon realized the extent of which computers were being thrown away as companies upgraded their technology infrastructure. Related video Watch Sofia Carson perform 'Applause' at CNN Heroes celebration “We have kids here (in Kenya) — myself included, back in the day — who don’t even know what a computer is,” she said. So, in 2018, she began transporting donated computers back to Kenya — in her personal luggage, handling customs fees and taxes herself. “At one point, I was bringing 44 computers, and I paid more for the luggage than I did for the air ticket,” she said. A year later, she co-founded TechLit Africa with a fellow software engineer after both quit their jobs. The nonprofit accepts computer donations from companies, universities and individuals. The hardware is wiped and refurbished before it’s shipped to Kenya. There, it’s distributed to partner schools in rural communities, where students ages 4 to 12 receive daily classes and frequent opportunities to learn from professionals, gaining skills that will help improve their education and better prepare them for future jobs. “We have people who own a specific skill coming in and are just inspiring the kids (with) music production, video production, coding, personal branding,” Cheboi said. “They can go from doing a remote class with NASA on education to music production.” The organization currently serves 10 schools; within the next year, Cheboi hopes to be partnered with 100 more. “My hope is that when the first TechLit kids graduate high school, they’re able to get a job online because they will know how to code, they will know how to do graphic design, they will know how to do marketing,” Cheboi said. “The world is your oyster when you are educated. By bringing the resources, by bringing these skills, we are opening up the world to them.” CNN’s Anderson Cooper and ABC’s Kelly Ripa co-hosted the 16th Annual “CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute,” which featured more than a dozen celebrity presenters. “We’re so deeply honored to be here,” said actress and singer Sofia Carson, who perfomed a song with award-winning songwriter Diane Warren at the event. “Diane wrote this incredible anthem ‘Applause’ for those leading, surviving and fighting and tonight we dedicate this song and performance to our heroes.” Actor Aubrey Plaza introduced CNN Hero Aidan Reilly, who launched his nonprofit while home from college during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic. “From his pandemic couch, Aidan and his friends co-founded Farmlink Project,” Plaza said. The nonprofit connects excess food from farms across the US – food that would otherwise be wasted – to those who need it. “In just two years, he .. has moved more than 70 million pounds,” Plaza added. Related article CNN spotlights 10 men and women who are making the world a better place Debra Vines – whose nonprofit The Answer Inc. supports families impacted by autism in underserved communities across Chicago – was honored by actress Holly Robinson Peete, a “fellow autism mom.” Vines says her group has provided programming and guidance to more than 4,000 families. “Join me and be a servant for the change today,” Vines said when accepting her award. And Emmy award-winning actor Justin Theroux brought his rescue dog Kuma, on the stage to honor Carie Broecker ​​and her nonprofit, Peace of Mind Dog Rescue. Two teenagers making a difference in their communities were also honored as 2022 Young Wonders: Ruby Chitsey, a 15-year-old from Harrison, Arkansas, started “Three Wishes for Ruby’s Residents,” which donates personal items to nursing home residents who couldn’t otherwise afford them. Sri Nihal Tammana, a 13-year-old from Edison, New Jersey, started “Recycle My Battery,” which keeps used batteries out of the ecosystem through a network of collection bins. The show also honored two Georgia poll workers, Shaye Moss and her mother Ruby Freeman, whose lives were upended after false allegations that they had been involved in election fraud spread on social media. CNN has partnered with GoFundMe to enable donations to this year’s Top 10 honorees. GoFundMe is the world’s largest fundraising platform that empowers people and charities to give and receive help. Supporters can make online donations to the Top 10 CNN Heroes’ non-profit organizations directly from CNNHeroes.com.

See Full Bio The Wells Fargo Reflect® Card is good for paying off big purchases or refinancing credit card debt. It has the longest 0% intro APR I've seen, so it's hard to beat for saving on interest. But this card is light on other perks and doesn't have much to offer after the introductory APR ends.

If you need a 0% intro APR for as long as possible, then the Wells Fargo Reflect® Card is worth getting. It gives you plenty of time to pay off purchases and balance transfers without incurring interest charges. Those who can make do with a shorter intro APR period should look for cards with more benefits, such as cash rewards and a welcome offer. The nice thing about credit cards with a 0% intro APR is that it's easy to compare them. The key factor is how long the intro rate lasts -- on purchases, balance transfers, or both, depending on what you need the card for. For example, if you have a lot of debt and are looking for a way to refinance it, then you'd probably want to go with the card that has the longest 0% intro APR on balance transfers. Wells Fargo has done a great job in this regard. Not only does this card have a lengthy introductory period, it applies to purchases and balance transfers. Want to know what other sites and real cardholders think of the Wells Fargo Reflect® Card? Here's what we found. Average competitor rating: 4.1 / 5 stars After reading reviews from five other top sites, there's a pretty clear consensus about this Wells Fargo card. We all agree that the 0% intro APR offer is excellent, making it one of the best credit cards for avoiding interest, and that the cellphone protection is a valuable extra. Everyone's in agreement about this card's drawbacks, too: Lack of rewards, a high balance transfer fee, and a foreign transaction fee. The only difference of opinion is the overall rating each of us gave this card. The Wells Fargo Reflect® Card hasn't exactly set the social media world on fire, but responses have generally been positive. It's widely recognized as an excellent 0% intro APR and balance transfer card. Some cardholders have called out the balance transfer fee of 5%, min: $5, since that's more than the 3% charged by several other cards. But they also acknowledge that 21 months from account opening is a long time to pay off credit card debt. If you need to avoid interest charges for as long as possible, look no further. The Wells Fargo Reflect® Card has a 0% intro APR on purchases and qualifying balance transfers for 21 months from account opening. That's nearly two years where you won't be paying credit card interest. Balance transfers made within the first 120 days qualify for the intro rate. After the intro period ends, the go-to 18.24%, 24.74%, or 29.99% Variable APR applies on your card's balance going forward. This is the longest 0% intro APR I've seen. Since it applies to purchases and balance transfers, there are all kinds of ways to use it. You could: Considering how much smartphones cost, and the many hazards they seem to face, it's a good idea to have yours insured. They may seem affordable when you're paying them off across 24 monthly payments. When you lose one and need to pay MSRP for a new iPhone, that's when you realize it costs about as much as a rent payment. If you have this card and use it to pay your monthly cellphone bill, you won't need to shell out extra for insurance. It has complimentary cellphone protection of up to $600, with a $25 deductible. This covers damage, theft, and involuntary or accidental parting (when you know where your phone is, but it's impractical to recover it). The biggest drawback with this card is that it doesn't offer any sort of rewards program. That means: To be fair, this card has special offers through My Wells Fargo Deals, where you can earn cash back statement credits on shopping, dining, and experiences you pay for with your eligible Wells Fargo card. But earning some statement credits here and there isn't nearly as valuable as earning cash rewards on all your everyday purchases. Because of the lack of rewards, this card doesn't have much long-term value. Once the 0% intro APR ends, there's no incentive to continue using it. You're better off switching to a rewards credit card at that point. It's worth noting that there are 0% APR credit cards that also have rewards programs. They just have shorter 0% APR intro periods. If you don't need the entire 21 months from account opening this Wells Fargo card offers, then it could make more sense to pick a card with a shorter intro period that earns rewards. The Wells Fargo Reflect® Card is a great balance transfer card because of its 0% intro APR. But it also has a balance transfer fee of 5%, min: $5. Balance transfer cards normally have a fee like this, but some of them only charge 3%. It may not seem like much, but if you're transferring $5,000, that 2% difference would cost you an extra $100. If you don't need 21 months from account opening to get out of debt, you may want to look at more credit card reviews and pick a card with a lower balance transfer fee. There's also a foreign transaction fee of 3%, which is another reason why this isn't the best card for long-term use. If you ever travel outside the United States, it's important to have a card you can use without any extra fees, like a travel credit card A FICO® Score of 670 or higher, which is considered good credit, is suggested to apply for the Wells Fargo Reflect® Card. Keep in mind that credit card applications depend on many factors, including your income and other parts of your financial profile. Wells Fargo offers an online prequalification tool. All you need to do is provide some basic information, and you'll see any prequalified credit card offers you have with Wells Fargo, which may or may not include the Wells Fargo Reflect® Card. The Wells Fargo Reflect® Card has a 0% intro APR for 21 months from account opening on purchases and qualifying balance transfers. Balance transfers made within 120 days from account opening qualify for the introductory rate. Here are the fees for the Wells Fargo Reflect® Card: The minimum credit limit on the Wells Fargo Reflect® Card is $1,000. It's possible to get a much larger amount -- some cardholders have reported being approved for limits of over $25,000. When you're approved for this card, Wells Fargo sets a credit limit based on several factors, primarily your income and credit history. If you want to earn cash rewards: The Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card earns an unlimited 2% cash rewards on purchases and has a $200 cash rewards welcome bonus for spending $500 in the first three months. This card's intro APR doesn't last as long, but if you don't need as long as 21 months, then its cash rewards could make it a better choice. If you want a lower balance transfer fee: The Citi Double Cash® Card has a balance transfer fee of 3% ($5 min.) on transfers in the first four months, 5% ($5 min.) thereafter. Those transfers also qualify for a 0% intro APR for 18 months. If you can pay off your debt within a year and a half, this card is a good choice, because you'll save money on fees. At The Motley Fool Ascent, we rate credit cards on a five-star scale (1 = poor, 5 = best). Our rating criteria includes rewards rates, welcome bonuses, fees, and perks like travel credits and 0% intro APR offers to evaluate our ratings. We combine these factors with an evaluation of brand reputation and customer satisfaction to ensure you're getting the best card recommendations. Learn more about how The Ascent rates credit cards. It's not hard to get approved for the Wells Fargo Reflect® Card, but it depends on your credit score and your financial profile. A credit score of 670 or higher is recommended when applying to make it more likely that you qualify for the card. The credit limit for the Wells Fargo Reflect® Card can range from $1,000 to over $10,000. Wells Fargo sets your credit limit when it approves you for the card based on your creditworthiness, income, and other financial information.

2,2024-08-04 07:36:36.000,BBC News,2024-08-04 05:36:28.000,US urges citizens to leave Lebanon on 'any available ticket',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80xxeqel5po,2024-08-03 22:47:14.000,"The US embassy in Beirut has urged its citizens to leave Lebanon on “any ticket available”, amid soaring tensions in the Middle East. The advisory follows a similar warning from UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who said the regional situation “could deteriorate rapidly”. Iran has vowed “severe” retaliation against Israel, which it blames for the death of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on Wednesday. His assassination came hours after Israel killed Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut. It is feared that Lebanon-based Hezbollah, an Iran-backed group, could play a heavy role in any such retaliation, which in turn could spark a serious Israeli response. Hezbollah launched dozens of rockets at the town of Beit Hillel in northern Israel at around 00:25 local time on Sunday (22:25 BST Saturday) . Footage posted on social media showed Israel's Iron Dome air defence system intercepting the rockets. There have been no reports of casualties. Jordan's Foreign Ministry has also issued advice to its citizens, telling those in Lebanon to leave immediately and warning others not to travel there. Canada has warned its nationals to avoid travel to Israel, on top of existing advice against going to Lebanon, because the ""situation can deteriorate further without warning"" in the region. The US embassy stated on Saturday that those who choose to stay in Lebanon should “prepare contingency plans” and be prepared to “shelter in place for an extended period of time”. It said that several airlines have suspended and cancelled flights, and many have sold out, but “commercial transportation options to leave Lebanon remain available"". The Pentagon said it was deploying additional warships and fighter jets to the region to help defend Israel from possible attacks by Iran and its proxies. The UK said it was sending extra military personnel, consular staff and border force officials to help with any evacuations - but urged UK citizens to leave Lebanon “while commercial flights are running"". Two British military ships are already in the region and the Royal Air Force has put transport helicopters on standby. Mr Lammy said it was “in no-one’s interest for this conflict to spread across the region”. Meanwhile in Gaza, at least 17 people in a school sheltering displaced persons were killed by an Israeli strike, the Hamas-run authorities said on Saturday. The Israeli military says the Hamama school in Gaza City's Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood was being used as a command centre for militants. Hamas has denied it operates from civilian facilities. Israeli ministers were sent home this weekend with satellite phones in case of an attack on the country's communication infrastructure. In April, Iran launched an air attack on Israel using 170 drones, 30 cruise missiles and at least 110 ballistic missiles. That was in retaliation for the Israeli bombing of an Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria. Many fear Iran’s retaliation on this occasion could take a similar form. In a phone call with EU Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell on Friday, Iran's Acting Foreign Minister Ali Baqeri Kani said Iran would ""undoubtedly use its inherent and legitimate right"" to ""punish"" Israel. On Friday, an announcer on Iran's state TV warned ""the world would witness extraordinary scenes"". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Israelis that ""challenging days lie ahead... We have heard threats from all sides. We are prepared for any scenario"". Tensions between Israel and Iran initially escalated with the killing of 12 children and teenagers in a strike on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Israel accused Hezbollah and vowed “severe” retaliation, though Hezbollah denied it was involved. Days later, senior Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr was killed in a targeted Israeli air strike in Beirut. Four others, including two children, were also killed. Hours after that, Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Iran, Hamas's main backer. He was visiting to attend the inauguration of Iran's new president, Masoud Pezeshkian. At a funeral ceremony for Haniyeh in Tehran on Thursday, Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, led the prayers. He had earlier vowed that Israel would suffer a “harsh punishment” for the killing. Western media reports suggest Israel's secret service planted bombs inside the building Ismail Haniyeh was staying in. Iran says it will ""punish"" Israel for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. Iran has threatened “harsh punishment” for Israel, which it blames for Ismail Haniyeh's assassination in Tehran. Iran says it will avenge the killing of Hamas's Ismail Haniyeh - but what will that mean in practice? Widely considered the group's overall leader, Haniyeh had been a prominent member since the late 1980s. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

2,2024-08-04 07:36:36.000,BBC News,2024-08-04 05:36:28.000,Iran says Hamas leader killed from close range,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg64642q0dxo,2024-08-03 14:57:04.000,"Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh was killed with a ""short-range projectile"" fired from outside his guesthouse in Tehran, Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) says. The paramilitary organisation said the projectile weighed about 7kg (16lbs) and caused a ""strong blast"", killing Haniyeh and his bodyguard last Wednesday. The Hamas leader had been visiting the Iranian capital for the inauguration of President Massoud Pezeshkian. The IRGC accused Israel of designing and implementing the operation - supported by the US. Israel has not commented on Haniyeh's death. The IRGC account is at odds with reports in Western media, which have suggested that explosives were planted in the guesthouse by Israeli operatives. The failures surrounding Haniyeh's death, especially on a day marked by intense security, have caused embarrassment for Iran and the IRGC. Dozens of IRGC officers have been arrested or dismissed in the days since Haniyeh's death, the New York Times reported on Saturday. The paper said the organisation's intelligence agency had taken over the investigation. Staff members at Haniyeh's guesthouse have been interrogated and their phones and other electronics have been seized, it added. Meanwhile, the security details of Iranian politicians have been overhauled. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei led prayers for Haniyeh on Thursday, but was whisked away soon after the ceremony by his security detail. The IRGC's statement on Saturday came after Britain's Daily Telegraph said Haniyeh was killed by bombs planted in his room by agents of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency Citing Iranian officials, the paper said two Mossad agents had entered the guesthouse and planted explosives in three rooms. The Iranians, who had viewed CCTV footage of the operatives, said the two subsequently left the country before detonating the bombs from outside Iran. The New York Times also reported that Haniyeh was killed by explosives detonated in his room, saying they could have been planted up to two months earlier. The BBC has not been able to verify these claims. But Hamas officials told the BBC earlier this week that Haniyeh had stayed at the same guesthouse before. He had made up to 15 visits to Iran since becoming the head of the political bureau in 2017. The papers' reports - if true - would represent an even bigger failure for the IRGC, who have long controlled internal security in the country. Experts also said it would highlight the degree to which Mossad can operate with impunity in Iran. Regardless of the manner of Haniyeh's death, both Iran and Hamas have vowed to retaliate. The IRGC said on Saturday that Israel would receive ""a severe punishment at the appropriate time, place and manner"". Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militia and political group in Lebanon, has also vowed reprisals. One of their top commanders, Fuad Shukr, was killed in an Israeli strike last Tuesday. After an Israeli operation killed IRGC Brig Gen Mohammad Reza Zahedi in Damascus earlier this year, Iran fired 170 drones, 30 cruise missiles and at least 110 ballistic missiles towards Israel.  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Israelis that ""challenging days lie ahead... We have heard threats from all sides. We are prepared for any scenario"". His ministers were sent home this weekend with satellite phones in case of an attack on the country's communication infrastructure. Despite the government's warnings, the mood appeared relaxed on Tel Aviv's seafront, with bronzed bodies lazing under beach umbrellas. But few are in any doubt that the Middle East stands perilously close to full-scale war. Israel is on high alert and several international airlines have suspended flights to the country. The US has also deployed additional warships and fighter jets to the Middle East to help defend Israel from possible attacks by Iran and its proxies, the Pentagon said. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy has warned that the risk that ""the situation on the ground could deteriorate rapidly is rising"". Meanwhile, at least 10 people have been killed in an Israeli airstrike on a school sheltering displaced people in Gaza's Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood, the Hamas-run government media office has said. It comes as Israel said an airstrike it conducted in the occupied West Bank killed a Hamas commander and four senior Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters on Saturday. The Israeli military said the air strike hit a vehicle as the men were on the way to carry out an attack. Elsewhere, Israeli officials - including the directors of Mossad and the internal security agency Shin Bet - have arrived in Cairo for fresh ceasefire talks. They will meet Egyptian intelligence chief, Abbas Kamel, and other senior military officials in a bid to rescue a potential truce. But US President Joe Biden admitted on Friday that Haniyeh's death had damaged the talks. Haniyeh was heavily involved in negotiations and Mr Biden said his death “doesn’t help” efforts to end the ten-month old conflict. The war began in October when Hamas carried out an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. The attack triggered a massive Israeli military response, which has killed at least 39,550 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The UK and Jordan also tell citizens to leave, as Israel's tensions with Iran reach a new high. Iran says it will ""punish"" Israel for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. The US president made the criticism in his first comments on the apparent Israeli assassination. The strike on 1 April killed seven charity workers from the World Central Kitchen, including one Australian. The killing of Hezbollah and Hamas leaders crossed ""red lines"", Hassan Nasrallah says, but he stops short of declaring all-out war. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

2,2024-08-04 07:36:36.000,BBC News,2024-08-04 05:36:28.000,Venezuela opposition leader emerges despite arrest threat,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0krrgypq70o,2024-08-04 02:39:12.000,"Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado has addressed a mass rally in the capital Caracas, defying government calls for her arrest. Ms Machado went into hiding earlier this week after accusing President Nicolás Maduro of defrauding the opposition candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez, of a clear victory in the presidential election. The president in turn has promised ""maximum punishment"" for anti-government demonstrators who say his re-election was rigged. The electoral commission - controlled by allies of Mr Maduro - has insisted he won with 52% of last Sunday's vote, but independent observers have said it lacked transparency.  The commission has not published the full breakdown of results. The opposition has said its own vote tally shows it won the election by a wide margin. Opinion polls ahead of the election had suggested a clear victory for the challenger. On Saturday Ms Machado addressed thousands of her supporters in Caracas from a truck bearing a banner reading ""Venezuela has won"". ""We have never been so strong as today,"" she told the crowd, adding that ""the regime has never been weaker... It has lost all legitimacy"". The opposition leader, who was blocked from running in the election, has spent days in hiding. Earlier this week, Ms Machado wrote in The Wall Street Journal that she had been left ""fearing for my life,"" along with other opposition leaders. She was greeted by cheers of ""freedom, freedom"" and was accompanied by several other opposition leaders - but not Mr Gonzales. In a separate a video message he urged supporters to ""respond to the regime's attacks with hope, harmony, and peace"". Security forces in Venezuela have spent the past several days trying to contain mass protests. At least 11 people have died in clashes with police. Speaking to supporters in Caracas on Saturday, Mr Maduro said around ""2,000 prisoners"" had been detained since the election a week ago. He promised ""maximum punishment"" for them, adding: ""This time there will be no forgiveness."" The government is coming under increasing international pressure. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Friday that there was ""overwhelming evidence"" that Mr Gonzalez had won the election. His intervention comes as the presidents of Brazil, Mexico and Colombia all called on Venezuela to release detailed election results. Other regional governments, including Argentine, Costa Rica, Panama and Uruguay have all raised concern over the vote. But Mr Maduro has been backed by his allies in Russia, China and Cuba. He has asked Venezuela's top court to audit the voting tallies with a view to confirming the results, which handed him another six-year term in power. The opposition says the court is in the hands of government loyalists who will delay the publication of the tallies. Mr Gonzalez boycotted court proceedings on Friday. Hundreds of demonstrators have been detained following Venezuela's disputed presidential election. Under pressure to back up claims he won the election, President Maduro turns to the country's top court. The Carter Center says the presidential election ""cannot be considered democratic"". Jordan Goudreau, 48, allegedly sent weapons, ammunition and other gear without a US export licence. The opposition says it has proof President Maduro's victory claim is fraudulent; his defence minster has warned of a ""coup"". Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

2,2024-08-04 07:36:36.000,BBC News,2024-08-04 05:36:28.000,Ukraine says it sank Russian submarine in Crimea,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4nggvg1yggo,2024-08-03 16:39:53.000,"Ukraine's military says it attacked and destroyed a Russian submarine while it was anchored at a port in the occupied Crimean peninsula. The Rostov-on-Don, a kilo-class attack submarine launched in 2014, sank after it was struck in a missile attack on the port city of Sevastopol on Friday, Ukraine's general staff said in a statement. It was reportedly one of four submarines operated by Russia's Black Sea fleet capable of launching Kalibr cruise missiles. The Russian defence ministry has not commented. Officials in Kyiv said the attack also destroyed four S-400 air defence systems protecting the peninsula, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014. Intelligence officials in the UK noted last September that the Rostov-on-Don ""likely suffered catastrophic damage"" in a missile strike while undergoing maintenance at a Sevastopol shipyard. Ukraine's military said Russia subsequently repaired the vessel and it was recently testing its capabilities near Sevastopol. The vessel was worth $300m (£233m), they added. ""The destruction of Rostov-on-Don once again proves that there is no safe place for the Russian fleet in the Ukrainian territorial waters of the Black Sea,"" the general staff in Kyiv said in a statement on Saturday. It marks the latest attack on Russian naval forces in Sevastopol in recent months. In March alone, Ukraine said it hit two landing ships and a patrol vessel in the port city. Since Russia launched its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 it has suffered several major naval setbacks. Ukraine says it has seriously damaged or sunk at least 15 warships, including the Black Sea fleet's flagship, the Moskva. Last week Ukraine's military said Moscow had been forced to withdraw all of its naval assets from the Sea of Azov - a body of water connected to the Black Sea - due to repeated strikes on its vessels. And Russia's internal security service, the FSB, recently said it foiled a Ukrainian plot to destroy its last remaining aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov. The ship, launched in 1985, has been undergoing repairs since 2018. Meanwhile, officials in Kyiv said Ukrainian drones targeted a major airfield and oil depots in Russia. The attack targeted the Morozovsk airfield, where guided bombs which have recently wrecked havoc on Ukrainian cities, are stored. Online footage said to be from the base showed powerful explosions and huge fires, after what appears to be several hits on fuel or ammunition depots. Russia said many of the drones used were shot down, but local authorities have declared a state of emergency around the air base. Oil storage facilities were also targeted in the Rostov, Kursk and Belgorod regions. The attacks come after Russia launched more than 600 guided air bombs towards Ukraine in a week, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. He said that it was crucial that Ukraine stopped Russian aircraft from launching the munitions and said that attacking airfields in Russia to do so was ""quite fair"". Ukraine's allies have previously been reluctant to allow it to strike within Russia using Western weapons, though the US has recently granted Kyiv permission to attack some targets along the border. Earlier this week Lithuania's foreign minister said the first deliveries of F-16 fighter jets had arrived in Ukraine. Long promised by Kyiv's Nato allies, President Zelenky views the planes as central to his country's air defence plans. The Times newspaper reported that six jets donated by the Netherlands had arrived in the country, but Dutch defence officials declined to comment when approached by the BBC earlier this week. Officials in Kyiv will also hope that the jets can help arrest Russian momentum on the frontlines. Moscow's forces have been making incremental gains in the east of the country for several weeks.  With dissent snuffed out at home, Russia intensifies attacks on opponents seeking refuge in the West. Seven people have now been charged over a suspected arson attack against a Ukraine-linked business. Both also conveyed gratitude to the countries who worked to free them. The president is using his final months in office to take a victory lap after weeks of personal and political turmoil. Eight Russian prisoners were released in the swap, including spies, agents and a convicted assassin. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

2,2024-08-04 07:36:36.000,BBC News,2024-08-04 05:36:28.000,Bangladesh on the boil as rival activists hold marches,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8vdd4venj7o,2024-08-04 02:27:25.000,"Bangladesh is tense as both anti-government protesters and the governing Awami League are set to hold rallies across the country on Sunday. The demonstrations are happening in the aftermath of deadly violence during protests last month over quotas in civil service jobs, in which more than 200 people were killed. Around 10,000 people have been reportedly detained in a major crackdown by security forces in the past two weeks. Those arrested included opposition supporters and students. Students Against Discrimination, a group behind the anti-government demonstrations, has called on prime minister Sheikh Hasina to step down. The group has announced a nationwide disobedience movement starting from Sunday, urging citizens not to pay taxes or any utility bills. The students have also called for a shutdown of all factories and public transport. The Awami League, the party of Ms Hasina, is also holding marches across the country on Sunday. With both sides set to hold rallies there are concerns that there could be further violence. The next few days are seen as crucial for both camps. ""Sheikh Hasina should not only resign, there should be a trial for the killings, looting and corruption,” Nahid Islam, one of the student movement's leaders, told thousands of people at a gathering on Saturday in Dhaka. The protests pose a momentous challenge to Ms Hasina, who was elected for a fourth consecutive term in January elections, boycotted by the main opposition. Students took to the streets last month over the reservation of many civil service jobs for relatives of the veterans of Bangladesh’s independence war with Pakistan in 1971. Most of the quota has now been scaled back by the government following a government ruling, but students have continued to protest, demanding justice for those killed and injured. Now they want Ms Hasina to step down. Supporters of Ms Hasina have ruled out her resignation. Earlier, Ms Hasina offered unconditional dialogue with the student leaders, saying she wanted the violence to end. “I want to sit with the agitating students of the movement and listen to them. I want no conflict,"" she said. But the student protesters have rejected her offer. Ms Hasina called in the military last month to restore order after several police stations and state buildings were set on fire during the protests. The Bangladeshi army chief, General Waker-Uz-Zaman, held a meeting with junior officers in Dhaka to assess the security situation. “Bangladesh Army has always stood by the people and will continue to do so for the interest of people and in any need of the state,"" Gen Zaman said, according to a release by the Inter Services Public Relation Directorate. The protests have restarted in several cities and the government is struggling to control the rising tide of anger over how it initially responded to the demonstrations. Bangladeshi media says most of those killed in last month’s protests were shot dead by police. Thousands were injured. The government argues that police opened fire only in self-defence and to protect state properties. Many said she did not appear to express the same level of sympathy towards those who had died. Three defendants were sentenced to life after being convicted of ""inciting riots"" in the Gulf state. Protesters demand a merit-based system for high-paying government jobs to replace the current quota allocations. Provides an overview of Bangladesh, including key dates and facts about this South Asian nation. Ms Hasina secures her fourth straight term after the main opposition boycotts the election.

Abdifatah Adan Hassan said around 63 people were also wounded, some of them critically. Video footage showed a number of bodies and injured people in Mogadishu's Abdiaziz district. Al-Shabab controls large parts of southern and central Somalia. The group is affiliated to al-Qaeda and has waged a brutal insurgency for nearly 20 years against the UN-backed government in Somalia. In a statement claiming the attack, al-Shabab said ""politicians, [security] forces and employees from various ministries and offices"" were among those killed. The group says the death toll and injuries are much higher than figures released by the police. One eyewitness told AFP news agency people were in a state of panic, as ""it was hard to know what was happening because shooting started soon after the blast"". Abdilatif Ali said some people attempted to take cover on Lido beach, while others tried to flee the location. ""I saw wounded people at the beachside. People were screaming in panic and it was hard to notice who was dead and who was still alive,"" he added. At least five people were responsible for the attack, as Mr Hasan said one attacker blew himself up while three others were killed. One attacker was captured alive, the police spokesman told reporters in Mogadishu. Moussa Faki Mahamat, chair of the African Union Commission, described the attack as ""horrific"".

2,2024-08-04 07:36:36.000,BBC News,2024-08-04 05:36:28.000,Trump and Harris at odds over presidential debate,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2g22365yqo,2024-08-03 18:53:08.000,"US presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are at odds over their first head-to-head debate, with each in favour of a different broadcaster and date. The Harris campaign is pushing for a debate to take place on ABC News on 10 September, in a slot previously scheduled for a debate between President Joe Biden and Mr Trump. But Mr Trump says the ABC debate has been ""terminated"" by Mr Biden leaving the race - and has instead pushed for himself and Ms Harris to debate on Fox News on 4 September. The pair will face off for the presidency when the US goes to the polls on 5 November. The disagreement began after President Biden dropped out of the race on 21 July, with Ms Harris immediately becoming favourite to secure the Democratic nomination. Since then, Mr Trump has been non-committal about whether he will still take part in the previously scheduled ABC News debate. US TV networks have been negotiating with both campaigns to arrange new dates. On Friday night, Mr Trump wrote on his social network Truth Social that he had accepted Fox News' proposal for a debate on 4 September, which is pencilled to take place in Pennsylvania - a key battleground state. He wrote that the moderators would be Fox News’ Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum - and that the rules would be similar to his debate with Mr Biden. ""If for any reason Kamala is unwilling or unable to debate on that date, I have agreed with Fox to do a major Town Hall on the same September 4th evening,"" he wrote. Mr Trump added that the prior agreement has been terminated because Joe Biden is no longer taking part and because his defamation case against the broadcaster would mean there is a conflict of interest. The Harris campaign has responded saying the former president is ""running scared"" and is trying to back out of the agreed debate. They said he’s looking to Fox News – a conservative cable network - to ""bail him out"". “He needs to stop playing games and show up to the debate he already committed to on Sept 10,"" Michael Tyler, Harris Campaign communications director said. Ms Harris followed up on social media, saying it is interesting how “any time, any place” becomes “one specific time, one specific safe space"". ""I’ll be there on September 10th, like he agreed to,"" she wrote. Ms Harris’ team said they are open to discussing further debates but only after the agreed one takes place. If and when the next debate does happen it will be keenly watched to see how the two contenders match up. Ms Harris secured enough pledges to become the Democratic nominee on Friday. During a campaign rally in Atlanta on Wednesday, Ms Harris challenged Mr Trump to debate her, saying “if you got something to say, say it to my face"". The debate news comes just hours after a report by the Homeland Security Department revealed that the US Secret Service made mistakes in their response to the 6 January attack on the US Capitol. Ms Harris, who was then vice-president-elect, came within 20ft (6m) of a ""viable"" pipe bomb planted outside the Democratic National Committee's headquarters in Washington. That bomb - and a similar one found at the Republican National Committee headquarters - were placed near the buildings the night before Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol.

2,2024-08-04 07:36:36.000,BBC News,2024-08-04 05:36:28.000,Snoop Dogg: America's cheerleader at the Olympics ,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6p229ldn4vo,2024-08-03 20:42:20.000,"There are few people who have become more synonymous with the 2024 Olympics than Snoop Dogg. When there is an American athlete vying for a medal in Paris, there is a camera ready to pan to the American rapper cheering in the stands. He has been seen dancing alongside the US women's gymnastics team, dressing up in equestrian gear to support American horseback riders and even trying out judo skills. Snoop Dogg's enthusiasm for the games has injected a new energy into the Olympics that is captivating viewers in Paris and the internet alike, and making for a highly watched summer games, according to NBC viewership numbers. After multiple clips went viral from Snoop Dogg's time hosting a highlight show with comedian Kevin Hart on NBC's streaming platform Peacock during the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 - the network gave the rapper an even bigger role in 2024: special correspondent. But Snoop Dogg has seemingly taken the role to the next level becoming a cheerleader for American athletes regardless of the sport. He started his games with an integral role: he was among the final torchbearers of the Olympic flame before the game's opening ceremony last week. The 52-year-old, whose full name is Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr, carried the torch through the streets of Saint-Denis in the north of Paris, home to the Stade de France Olympic Stadium. And while the role of special correspondent and his torch-bearing job were announced ahead of time, Snoop Dogg's consistent presence and high energy for the American athletes has been a special surprise for viewers. “We’ve been pleasantly surprised by his popularity, but you never ever underestimate Snoop Dogg,” Molly Solomon, NBC’s executive producer of the Olympics, told reporters this week. She described him an “ambassador of happiness”. When the US women's gymnastics team competed earlier this week, Snoop Dogg was dancing in the stands and sporting a t-shirt with Simone Biles' face on it. Elsewhere in Paris, he has cheered on tennis star Coco Gauff and volleyball star Kelly Cheng, among countless others. On Saturday, he joined American celebrity chef Martha Stewart in watching the equestrian events, while decked out in horse riding gear. He participated in promotional judo event during the games where he was awarded an honorary black belt and got a swimming lesson from American-swimming great Michael Phelps. Some have suggested the rapper's presence has been a defining factor in better ratings. Beginning on 26 July, the day of the opening ceremony, the five-day total audience average was 34 million viewers when combining daytime and primetime coverage, an NBC Sports release said. That is up 79% from the 2021 Tokyo Olympics where viewership suffered because of the pandemic. But beyond the ratings and the internet coalescing, Snoop Dogg said he is just enjoying himself. Never ""in his wildest dreams"" did he expect to play this role in the Olympics, he told NBC Nightly News’ Lester Holt in an interview recalling watching the Olympics on TV when he was younger. ""I'm the biggest kid in the crowd,"" Snoop Dogg said. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

2,2024-08-04 07:36:36.000,BBC News,2024-08-04 05:36:28.000,Plea deal with accused 9/11 plotters revoked,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7202593k0xo,2024-08-03 06:23:29.000,"US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin has revoked a pre-trial agreement reached with men accused of plotting the 11 September 2001 attacks. In a memo on Friday, Mr Austin also said he was revoking the authority of the officer overseeing the military court who signed the agreement on Wednesday. The original deal, which would reportedly have spared the alleged attackers the death penalty, was criticised by some families of victims. The 9/11 attacks in New York, Virginia and Pennsylvania were the deadliest assault on US soil since the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, where 2,400 people were killed. They sparked the ""War on Terror"" and the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. In his memo, Mr Austin named five defendants including the alleged ringleader of the plot, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, all of whom are held in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. The original deal named three men. ""I have determined that, in light of the significance of the decision to enter into pre-trial agreements with the accused... responsibility for such a decision should rest with me as the superior authority,"" Mr Austin wrote to Brig Gen Susan Escallier. ""I hereby withdraw your authority. Effective immediately, in the exercise of my authority, I hereby withdraw from the three pre-trial agreements."" The White House said on Wednesday that it had played no role in the plea deal. The five men named in the memo were: Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, often referred to as KSM, Walid Muhammad Salih Mubarak bin Attash, Mustafa Ahmed Adam al-Hawsawi; and two others not mentioned in the original plea: Ramzi bin al-Shibh and Ali Abdul Aziz Ali. The men have been in custody for decades without trial. All have alleged they were tortured - KSM was subjected to simulated drowning, so-called ""waterboarding"", 183 times before it was banned by the US government. All have already faced more than a decade of pre-trial hearings, complicated by the allegations and evidence of torture against them. Several family members of victims had criticised the terms of the deal struck on Wednesday as too lenient. Brett Eagleson, the president of 9/11 Justice, which represents survivors and relatives of victims, had told the BBC earlier this week that the families were ""deeply troubled by these plea deals"". Speaking on Saturday, Terry Strada, who lost her husband Tom and chairs the 9/11 Families United group, told the BBC she was ""very pleased"" to see the Pentagon revoke the plea deal and put the death penalty back on the table. If the men are found guilty after a trial, Mrs Strada said she would want to see the death penalty, ""not because I am ghoulish or a horrible person, it's because it fits the crime"". ""They've murdered nearly 3,000 Americans on American soil... lives were just permanently altered on that day,"" she added. A lawyer at Guantanamo representing Mohammed told The New York Times that he was shocked by the sudden u-turn. “If the secretary of defence issued such an order, I am respectfully and profoundly disappointed that after all of these years the government still has not learned the lessons of this case,” said lawyer Gary Sowards. “And the mischief that results from disregarding due process and fair play.” The men have been accused of a litany of charges, including attacking civilians, murder in violation of the laws of war, hijacking and terrorism. In September, the Biden administration reportedly rejected the terms of a plea deal with five men held at the US Navy base in Cuba, including Mohammed. The men had reportedly sought a guarantee from the president that they would not be kept in solitary confinement and would have access to trauma treatment. KSM is alleged to have brought the idea of hijacking and flying planes into buildings to al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. He was captured in Pakistan in 2003 along with Hawsawi, a Saudi who was an alleged fundraiser. Ali, a computer scientist and nephew of KSM, is accused of providing technical support to the 9/11 operation. Bin al-Shibh, a Yemeni, allegedly co-ordinated the attacks and had planned to be a hijacker but could not secure a US visa. Bin Attash, also a Yemeni, is accused of bombing the USS Cole in Yemen in 2000, which killed 17 sailors, and involvement in the 11 September attacks. Several Republicans applauded the defence secretary for revoking the deal. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson said the ""Biden-Harris Administration is correct to reverse course"", which he said followed Republicans ""launching investigations into this terrible plea deal"". ""Now deliver long awaited justice for 9/11 families,"" he said. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham said the decision ""exercised good command judgement"". ""The previous plea deal would have sent absolutely the wrong signal to terrorists throughout the world,"" he added. Earlier on Friday, Republican Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee Mike Rogers demanded answers from Mr Austin on how the deal was struck. “This deal signals willingness to negotiate with terrorists who deliberately harm Americans,” he wrote in a letter to the defence secretary. Donald Trump's lawyers presented ""no meaningful evidence"" he is being wrongly prosecuted, a judge has ruled. Rick Pero can't fathom starting over again after watching his home burn down again in northern California.

2,2024-08-04 07:36:36.000,BBC News,2024-08-04 05:36:28.000,Spies' children did not know they were Russian,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cljyj9jp993o,2024-08-03 15:08:31.000,"The children of a Russian spy couple who returned home on Thursday after the largest prisoner swap between the West and Russia since the Cold War only found out their nationality on the flight to Moscow. Artem Viktorovich Dultsev and Anna Valerevna Dultseva were posing as an Argentine couple living in Slovenia when they were jailed there. Their children do not speak a word of Russian and did not know who President Vladimir Putin was, asking their parents who was greeting them upon their arrival, the Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. In total, 24 people jailed in seven different countries were exchanged on Thursday. Sixteen were Western prisoners detained in Russian jails and eight were Russian prisoners held in the US, Norway, Germany, Poland and Slovenia. Among them was Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich. The Russian family of four were warmly welcomed, with Mrs Dultseva and her daughter receiving flowers and a warm embrace from President Putin. ""Buenas noches,"" the president said to the spies' children, as he greeted them in Spanish. As reported by Argentinian media, the couple were known as María Mayer and Ludwig Gisch and arrived in Slovenia sporting their Argentinian passports in 2017. The husband set up a start-up IT company under his alias name and the wife had an online art gallery. The family used Ljubljana as their base and it was not until 2022 that the couple were arrested by Slovenian police on espionage charges. Ahead of the large scale prisoner swap, Mr Dultsev and Mrs Dultseva were sentenced to 19 months in prison each, after pleading guilty to spying charges on Wednesday. But given their arrests in 2022, they were released on time served and ordered to leave Slovenia, as reported by the Associated Press. It was not until Thursday, during the large scale Russia-West prisoner swap, that the Kremlin spies, and their children, were returned to Russia. Life for 11-year-old Sofia and 8-year-old Gabriel, who were born in Argentina, changed thereafter and they only learnt they were Russian when the plane set off from Ankara to Vnukovo Airport, the Kremlin said. “The children of the undercover agents asked their parents yesterday who had greeted them,” Mr Peskov said, adding: “They did not even know who Putin is.” The Kremlin spokesman said that is how undercover agents (or ""illegals"") work, ""making such sacrifices for the sake of their work and their dedication to their service"". Unlike ""legal"" spies, who are posted abroad under diplomatic or other official cover, illegals are on their own - working normal jobs, living in suburbs and operating without the diplomatic immunity enjoyed by other agents should they be caught. With dissent snuffed out at home, Russia intensifies attacks on opponents seeking refuge in the West. Seven people have now been charged over a suspected arson attack against a Ukraine-linked business. Both also conveyed gratitude to the countries who worked to free them. The president is using his final months in office to take a victory lap after weeks of personal and political turmoil. Eight Russian prisoners were released in the swap, including spies, agents and a convicted assassin. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

2,2024-08-04 07:36:36.000,BBC News,2024-08-04 05:36:28.000,'Still alive' - graduate Asmaa's texts to BBC from the ruins of Gaza,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c728vj21qepo,2024-08-02 23:06:33.000,"For six years the BBC’s Paul Adams has been in contact with a young graduate in Gaza. Her text messages give a unique insight into the terrors and small triumphs she has experienced during the current conflict, and her fears for the future. My phone lights up. It is Asmaa. “Still alive,” she writes. It is 19 March 2024 and after several weeks of silence, Asmaa Tayeh has reappeared on WhatsApp. “Sorry. Bad internet connection and dangerous days.” And then silence. For another two months. It has been like this since 7 October. Long disappearances, punctuated by flurries of text messages, as the 28-year-old emerges, briefly, amid the nightmare of Gaza’s longest war. It is always late at night. Somewhere, Asmaa has found a signal. Far away in London, my phone pings as the messages tumble in. I met Asmaa in 2018. I was in Gaza, reporting on daily protests at the border fence with Israel, where thousands of mostly young Palestinians angrily commemorated their ancestors’ displacement during Israel’s War of Independence, 70 years earlier. Asmaa was not part of the protests. I found her at her family’s home a few miles away in Jabalia, quietly writing stories, some of which I had read online, about daily life in a place she both loved and hated. Her laptop was a cherished portal to the world outside. She had only ever known the Gaza Strip and its stifling sense of isolation. From her spartan room, she watched vloggers and Youtubers casually exploring places she could only dream of. As a recent graduate in a place with few job prospects and frequent outbreaks of extreme violence, the exotic images flashing onto her computer screen were intoxicating but painful. “They show me how handcuffed I am,” she wrote that year. A refugee camp of tents and tin shacks in the 1950s, Jabalia had long since morphed into a small city, more than 100,000 people crammed together in a place of tall buildings, teeming alleyways and open sewers. Despite her narrow confines, the young Asmaa was hopeful. In September 2022, she launched her own business, Star Café, an online coffee delivery service. Her social media feeds suggested an optimistic young entrepreneur, finally achieving long-cherished goals and planning for the future. A year later, on 6 October 2023, in an Instagram post artfully depicting her branded products alongside a vase of roses and a manicured hand, she thanked God for “the blessing of self-employment”. But what she didn’t know was that a meteor was hurtling in her direction, about to obliterate everything. The following day, Hamas gunmen stormed across the border fence, killing about 1,200 Israelis and foreigners in nearby communities and at the Nova music festival. Israel’s response was like nothing Gazans had ever seen before. Its military would go on to kill tens of thousands of people, displace more than 80% of the population, and render large parts of the Gaza Strip uninhabitable. Three days later, on 10 October, Asmaa got in touch. “Hey Paul. It’s nice to hear from you. We are unharmed,” she messaged. “But to be honest, I don’t feel safe at all. We could be bombed at any minute.” Despite hearing air strikes hitting nearby targets, Asmaa was hopeful the war would soon be over. But this was not a repeat of earlier Gaza wars. Within days, Israeli planes dropped leaflets, telling everyone in the northern Gaza Strip - more than one million people - to move south. Jabalia started to empty, but Asmaa’s family - 13 people spanning three generations - stayed put, fearing going south would prove a one-way journey. For the descendants of refugees who were forced or fled from their homes in 1948, never to return, the thought of history repeating itself stirred deep fears. Only her grandparents, elderly and frail, travelled, eventually finding shelter in Rafah. With electricity cut, food in freezers spoiling, and communications increasingly difficult, the family used a small generator every couple of days to charge mobiles and monitor the news. Asmaa’s messages were becoming increasingly sporadic. “It’s dangerous all over the Gaza Strip,” she told me on 15 October. At the end of October, Jabalia experienced its worst air strikes so far. Israel said it had targeted underground Hamas structures and killed large numbers of fighters. The scenes were apocalyptic, with civilians and rescue workers searching for survivors through vast craters and wrecked buildings. Asmaa vanished. My WhatsApp messages were no longer being read. I assumed the worst. But six weeks later, she suddenly reappeared. “I’m still alive, by God’s miracles,” she wrote on 12 December. It did, indeed, feel miraculous. In a torrent of messages that followed, Asmaa described the previous chaotic weeks. The family’s reluctant decision to leave Jabalia, efforts to head south thwarted by the intensity of the fighting, terrifying journeys through a city at war. “I saw so much that I cannot find words to describe,” she said. “The streets are scary and the smell of death is everywhere. People are getting skinny and sick. I feel like I’m living inside a horror movie.” When forced to walk, the family would spread out along the road, hoping this would improve their chances of survival. “We kept distance between us, so if any air strike comes, not all of us will die.” During a week-long ceasefire in late November, the family had briefly returned to the house in Jabalia. The top floor was gone. Asmaa’s own room, which had doubled up as her Star Café office and studio, was pockmarked by shrapnel. When the ceasefire collapsed on 1 December, they fled once more, finding refuge in a printing shop in Gaza City where one of Asmaa’s brothers had worked before the war. It was filthy, reeked of paint, and had no kitchen, mattresses, or water. “We basically lived with rats,” she says. When it was safe enough to go outside, they would walk, sometimes for hours, searching for clean water - especially vital to make up the formula for Asmaa’s two-month-old nephew. But after less than three weeks in the shop, Asmaa got a phone call from the Israeli army. She was used to the army’s recorded messages and leaflets dropped from the sky, with instructions to leave areas about to be attacked. But this time she found herself talking to a real person. The man said Israel was about to start an operation nearby. For her safety, and that of her family, she needed to leave. “I wanted to curse him, but I couldn’t.” She says she was curious, after two-and-a-half months of war, to find herself speaking to an Israeli. She imagined what it must feel like to spend your whole day making the same phone call over and over. “I felt like there is on the other side an employee who’s sick of his work.” For all the horrifying immediacy of the war consuming the north, this was as close as Asmaa ever came to meeting an Israeli soldier. Part of her wishes that she’d had more contact. “I’m really curious about the way they’re fighting, how they look at us, how they understand the struggle,” she told me later. “I feel like I need to dive inside their minds.” At the end of December, as the bulk of the fighting moved south, the family made its weary way back to the house in Jabalia. “We started the new year in the best way ever - all together in our partially-destroyed home.” Asmaa’s father, a retired carpenter, spent the following weeks repairing the damage, fixing windows, doors and cupboards. But food was in desperately short supply. International aid agencies warned that famine was looming. Asmaa noticed that people in Jabalia were starting to look gaunt. Asmaa’s family had stocked up on canned goods. But flour, meat, fruit and vegetables had all disappeared from the markets. Aid agencies were struggling to bring humanitarian relief to the north. The family eked out their dwindling rations, ate twice a day, and drank tea without sugar - something practically unheard of among Palestinians. On the roof of the house, where her brother’s room had once stood, her father started growing vegetables. Asmaa had lost 9kg (almost 20lb) and felt her appetite ebbing away. But slowly, the humanitarian situation started to improve. Air drops and new aid routes into the north kept famine at bay. Flour was back. The family had chicken and tomatoes for the first time in months. There was more water, too. Enough for the occasional shower. “We started to feel a little bit settled down.” But then the war came back. On 12 May, the Israeli army returned to Jabalia, saying intelligence indicated Hamas was once more operating out of the area. Asmaa was bewildered. “Only days ago, they were talking about a very possible ceasefire,” she wrote, “and suddenly I woke to ‘Let’s pack, we have to leave asap.’” The family went west, to an area known as al-Nasr, near the coast, where her grandparents had lived before the war. Al-Nasr was a wasteland, much of it reduced to rubble months earlier. But her grandparents’ house was intact. Long-since looted following their departure for the south, but somehow undamaged. The family moved in and settled down, wondering how long this third dislocation would last. One day, driven by curiosity, Asmaa walked to the nearby beach, where she marvelled at the sight of Gazans frolicking in the waves, despite the ominous presence of Israeli gunboats patrolling offshore. “We’ve started to feel careless,” she told me. “We don’t care for our lives any more. That’s how tired we are.” On 19 May came the news that Asmaa had long dreaded. Her grandfather had died the day before, aged 91. After being forced to move repeatedly, he and his wife had recently settled in a tent in al-Mawasi, a desperately overcrowded place of dismal conditions, where many Palestinians had fled after the Israeli army began an operation in Rafah at the start of the month. Sheltering in his abandoned house, Asmaa felt bereft. She hadn’t seen her grandfather since just before the war, when she had persuaded him to pose for a selfie. “I was so happy that I managed to take that memory.” Israeli forces finally left Jabalia on 1 June. Four days later, the family trudged back through streets so ravaged they were barely recognisable, to find their home still standing but increasingly battle-scarred. The whole process - of cleaning, repairing and planting - had to start again, made harder this time by the fact that a missile had destroyed the workshop where her father kept all his tools. For months, Asmaa and I had only ever communicated by text. Finally, in early July, we spoke on the phone. Two long conversations in which Asmaa took me through her Gazan odyssey and described how it had changed her. Each time, her voice faded in and out and the line crackled, creating the impression of enormous distance. Each time, Israeli drones, ubiquitous since this war began, could be heard buzzing in the background. Asmaa said survival was a mixed blessing. Everyone in the house was alive. But the war wasn’t over and the threat of death was constant. “I feel anxious all the time, thinking that there will be one day in which I will lose something,” she said. “I mean, our turn will come.” Gaza, where Asmaa had nurtured her dreams, had been devastated. But it wasn’t the physical changes that were absorbing her the most. Society, she said, had been utterly transformed. The constant shocks of death, displacement and trauma leaving whole neighbourhoods teetering on the brink of disintegration. Tight-knit communities had been blown apart, she said, with family members and neighbours scattered up and down the length of the Gaza Strip, and beyond. Sometimes, in the struggle for survival, Gazans had turned on themselves. A total breakdown in law and order leaving gangs and rival families to battle it out for control of precious resources. “It’s becoming really normal to see people even killing each other,” Asmaa said. But if war had brought out the worst in people, it had also brought out the best. In Jabalia, Asmaa said, people were sharing food and water, exchanging the latest news and information on where to charge mobile phones. With basic foodstuffs once again in short supply, women were swapping improvised recipes. “Everyone is really taking care of each other.” Asmaa said it would take decades for Gazans to recover the meagre, confined, life they knew before 7 October. Defiant talk of reconstruction and renewal, she said, felt delusional. As for herself, Asmaa’s only dream now was to escape. “I don’t have any hope in this place,” she told me. “I’m not the same person any more. I don’t think I’ll recover.” The Mercury retrograde phenomenon is associated with misfortune by some - but does it really affect us? Iran says it will ""punish"" Israel for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. The US says TikTok obstructed parents trying to cancel their children's accounts. The US president made the criticism in his first comments on the apparent Israeli assassination. The strike on 1 April killed seven charity workers from the World Central Kitchen, including one Australian. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

2,2024-08-04 07:36:36.000,BBC News,2024-08-04 05:36:28.000,'They're tightening the screws': Kremlin ups attacks on critics abroad,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl4y0j47xe4o,2024-08-04 00:50:57.000,"Two plain-clothed police officers were waiting for Dmitry Gudkov as he arrived at London’s Luton Airport last summer. The Russian opposition politician, who lives in exile in an EU country, was flying to the UK to attend a friend’s birthday. “They were there to intercept me immediately after I exited the plane,” Dmitry says. “That had never happened to me before."" But the police weren’t arresting him – instead, they wanted to warn him. “They told me I’m on a list of people who are in danger. They asked where I’ll be staying and what phone I’ll be using.” Dmitry Gudkov is the co-founder of the Anti-War Committee, an organisation that co-ordinates efforts to oppose the war in Ukraine. He is wanted in Russia for ""spreading fakes"" about the Russian army. The start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 led to a wide-ranging crackdown against opponents inside Russia. Almost all activists and independent journalists fled the country. Now, a number of Kremlin critics living in Europe have told the BBC that Russia is stepping up its efforts to silence, threaten and persecute opponents abroad. Some were unwilling to share their stories publicly. The Russian embassy in London didn’t respond to a request for comment. Analyst Mark Galeotti, who studies the Russian security services, agrees that the campaign against Russia’s ""enemies"" abroad is intensifying. “I think it reflects the growing paranoia of the Kremlin,” he says, “that it is involved in an existential political struggle."" With all dissent snuffed out at home, Russia is turning its attention to opponents who have sought refuge in the West. Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president who is now deputy head of Russia's Security Council, described them as “traitors who have gone over to the enemy and want their Fatherland to perish”. Another anti-Kremlin activist was also contacted by British police. “They said they needed to discuss the safety of me and my family,” Ksenia Maximova tells me. The founder of the Russian Democratic Society in London says the police advised her not to travel to certain countries where Russian agents operate more freely. “[The Kremlin is] stepping up the campaign against ‘enemies’, that’s absolutely true,” she says, “They’re tightening the screws.” She and her fellow campaigners have noticed an uptick in cyber attacks and attempts to infiltrate the group online. In a statement to the BBC, a spokesperson for UK Counter Terrorism Policing said, “We have been open for some time now about the growing demand within our casework relating to countering state threats… We have been actively increasing resources dedicated to countering the activity of hostile states.” In December, new UK legislation came into effect, giving police more powers to tackle threats from hostile states such as Russia. ""Parasites can’t sleep in peace..."" was one of the messages that investigative journalist Alesya Marokhovskaya received last year. The threats were accompanied by the name of the street in Prague where she lived. “I moved house to make it harder for them,” says Alesya. “We thought it may just be some crazy Czech guy who was pro-Putin and had recognised me on the street.” But then the messages became more sinister - calling her a ""scumbag"" and promising to find her ""wherever she walks her wheezing dog"". Alesya’s dog really does wheeze when it walks. She informed the Czech police. Later, Alesya was due to fly to Sweden to attend a conference. The sender then sent even more specific threats: details of her flight, seat number and the hotel she had booked. “It was clear they had high-level access to documents,” Alesya says. “It looks like the behaviour of the Russian state.” Alesya had been branded a 'foreign agent’ years before by the Russian government, due to her work at independent Russian news website iStories. “When I left Russia and came to Prague, I had this illusion of security,” says Alesya. “Now I realise that [Russian intelligence services] can get their hands on people almost anywhere in Europe. I can’t say I’m not afraid, because I am."" But why is this happening now? Experts suggest the Russian security services are beginning to activate operations abroad after a period of turmoil. Hundreds of Russian diplomats believed to be intelligence agents operating under diplomatic cover were expelled from Western countries following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. “There was a period of confusion after 2022,” says Andrei Soldatov, a Russian journalist who writes about the intelligence services. “In 2023, the agencies regrouped and found a new sense of purpose. They got resources and began increasing pressure.” Mark Galeotti says the authorities are increasingly turning to proxies to do their dirty work - criminal gangs: “If you want someone beaten up or even killed, they’re a lot easier to engage,” says Mr Galeotti, who has been writing about the links between the Russian state and organised crime for years. “They’re going to be some thug – maybe someone whom the Russian-based organised crime groups have at some point dealt with.” The Polish government believes that’s what happened in the case of Leonid Volkov, a prominent activist and associate of the late Alexei Navalny. He was brutally attacked with a hammer in Lithuania four months ago, but survived. The Polish Prime Minister, Donald Tusk, said a Belarusian man working for Russian intelligence had paid two Polish football hooligans to carry out the assault. All three have been arrested. “Intimidation is the intent,” suggests Mark Galeotti. “The idea that you'd better keep your head down. It’s a way of deterring the emergence of some kind of coherent political opposition [to the Kremlin].” The Russian authorities also try to make day-to-day life as difficult as possible for opponents abroad. Activist Olesya Krivtsova, 21, escaped from Russia after being arrested and threatened with jail for anti-war posts on social media. She now lives in Norway, but recently discovered her Russian passport had been cancelled, meaning she can’t apply for travel documents. “I think this is a new [method] of repression,” Olesya says. “They’re always thinking, how can we do more, how can we pressure them?” Several other activists living abroad have also had their passports cancelled without warning. Many have criminal cases open against them in Russia - without a valid passport, they cannot hire lawyers or make payments back home. The only way to resolve the issue is to return to Russia. For Olesya, returning would mean arrest and prison. She has now applied for a temporary Norwegian ID for refugees. “In Russia, now I only have one right – the right to go to prison. My passport is cancelled. This shows the essence of their cruelty,” says the young activist. “They’ve already completely destroyed my life and the life of my family…They’re never going to stop.” The Dultsev children thought they were from Argentina and cannot speak Russian. Seven people have now been charged over a suspected arson attack against a Ukraine-linked business. Both also conveyed gratitude to the countries who worked to free them. The president is using his final months in office to take a victory lap after weeks of personal and political turmoil. Eight Russian prisoners were released in the swap, including spies, agents and a convicted assassin. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

2,2024-08-04 07:36:36.000,BBC News,2024-08-04 05:36:28.000,World's biggest iceberg spins in ocean trap,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd168081wxvo,2024-08-03 23:05:44.000,"Something remarkable has happened to A23a, the world's biggest iceberg. For months now it has been spinning on the spot just north of Antarctica when really it should be racing along with Earth's most powerful ocean current. Scientists say the frozen block, which is more than twice the size of Greater London, has been captured on top of a huge rotating cylinder of water. It's a phenomenon oceanographers call a Taylor Column - and it's possible A23a might not escape its jailer for years. ""Usually you think of icebergs as being transient things; they fragment and melt away. But not this one,"" observed polar expert Prof Mark Brandon. ""A23a is the iceberg that just refuses to die,"" the Open University researcher told BBC News. The berg's longevity is well documented. It broke free from the Antarctic coastline way back in 1986, but then almost immediately got stuck in the bottom-muds of the Weddell Sea. For three decades it was a static ""ice island"". It didn't budge. It wasn't until 2020 that it re-floated and started to drift again, slowly at first, before then charging north towards warmer air and waters. In early April this year, A23a stepped into the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) - a juggernaut that moves a hundred times as much water around the globe as all Earth's rivers combined. This was meant to put boosters on the near-trillion-tonne berg, rifling it up into the South Atlantic and certain oblivion. Instead, A23a went precisely nowhere. It remains in place just north of South Orkney Islands, turning in an anti-clockwise direction by about 15 degrees a day. And as long as it does this, its decay and eventual demise will be delayed. A23a has not grounded again; there is at least a thousand metres of water between its underside and the seafloor. It's been stopped in its tracks by a type of vortex first described in the 1920s by a brilliant physicist, Sir G.I. (Geoffrey Ingram) Taylor. The Cambridge academic was a pioneer in the field of fluid dynamics, and was even brought into the Manhattan Project to model the likely stability of the world's first atomic bomb test. Prof Taylor showed how a current that meets an obstruction on the seafloor can - under the right circumstances - separate into two distinct flows, generating a full-depth mass of rotating water between them. In this instance, the obstruction is a 100km-wide bump on the ocean bottom known as Pirie Bank. The vortex sits on top of the bank, and for now A23a is its prisoner. ""The ocean is full of surprises, and this dynamical feature is one of the cutest you'll ever see,"" said Prof Mike Meredith from the British Antarctic Survey. ""Taylor Columns can also form in the air; you see them in the movement of clouds above mountains. They can be just a few centimetres across in an experimental laboratory tank or absolutely enormous as in this case where the column has a giant iceberg slap-bang in the middle of it."" How long might A23a continue to perform its spinning-top routine? Who knows, but when Prof Meredith placed a scientific buoy in a Taylor Column above another bump to the east of Pirie Bank, the floating instrument was still rotating in place four years later. A23a is a perfect illustration once again of the importance of understanding the shape of the seafloor. Submarine mountains, canyons and slopes have a profound influence on the direction and mixing of waters, and on the distribution of the nutrients that drive biological activity in the ocean. And this influence extends also to the climate system: it's the mass movement of water that helps disperse heat energy around the globe. A23a's behaviour can be explained because the ocean bottom just north of South Orkney is reasonably well surveyed. That's not the case for much of the rest of the world. Currently, only a quarter of Earth's seafloor has been mapped to the best modern standard. Parents praise the work of Jersey charity Healing Waves in its work with neurodiverse children. Rory Golden, who was on the Titan sub's support ship when it went missing, recounts the experience. The creature, the size of a poppy seed, dates back 520 million years and is almost perfectly preserved.

2,2024-08-04 07:36:36.000,BBC News,2024-08-04 05:36:28.000,He lost two homes to California fires in six years. Now what?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyr7rv3nep2o,2024-08-03 23:45:17.000,"Rick Pero was working in southern Mexico when the evacuation alerts started going off on his phone. A wildfire was threatening his California neighbourhood. Again. Back home - roughly 2,800 miles (4,500km) away - a man at a popular swimming hole shoved a burning car down into a dry, grassy ravine. Almost instantly, the area ignited and those enjoying the summer day started to panic. The flames, about 15 miles (24km) from Mr Pero’s home, were spreading fast in the tinder dry brush. “Uh oh, this is not looking good,” Mr Pero thought as he watched the blaze’s growth from his phone. Within hours, the Park Fire had consumed more than 6,000 acres and residents in the area were forced to evacuate. With them, the suspected arsonist who police say blended into the worried crowd and fled the area. Mr Pero, glued to his phone, packed his bags. He told his cat sitter to get his two felines and leave before it was too late. He knew the danger after surviving the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California’s history in 2018 - which razed the town of Paradise and took 85 lives. His home was incinerated. Mr Pero rebuilt his life in Forest Ranch, another small community about nine miles (14km) north of Paradise. He thought he was safe - his new “silver lining” home had stunning views and was much more fire resistant. But once again, a fire tore through his home and everything inside of it – possibly also stealing one of his cats that couldn’t be lured out of the house. The metal disfigured shells of two vehicles remain where his garage once stood. Piles of charred metal debris lay in piles. The foundations of the home aren’t even apparent anymore but some bricks from what appears to be a fireplace are stacked. The colourful sunset views over the wooded area behind his home now looks out on hundreds of scorched - and still smoking - pine trees. “The big sadness is we have a very close-knit neighbourhood,” he said. “I'm again, so, so grateful that they were able to save all of my neighbours, almost all my neighbours, houses.” Wildfires are becoming more intense and more frequent. The Park Fire, which started 24 July in a park in Chico, grew to more than 71,000 acres in just 24 hours. It’s now the fourth largest wildfire in California history after tearing through more than 400,000 acres and like Paradise, it spread at a shockingly fast and hot pace. About 12 hours after the blaze started, the person authorities say is responsible was arrested. Police say Ronnie Dean Stout II was spotted starting the fire and blending into the crowd as people rushed to flee. Witnesses said he acted erratically and may have been intoxicated. Authorities found him at a nearby mobile home park and charged him with arson. He has not entered a plea but reportedly told authorities his burning car rolled down the 60-foot embankment and it was an accident. He fled the area afterwards because he was afraid, Butte County District Attorney Michael Ramsey said. The blaze has consumed land in four counties, scorching an area larger than the size of greater Los Angeles or London. Although most of the land is uninhabited by humans, hundreds of homes have been lost in the blaze and experts worry it could take months before it’s fully extinguished. The area is a frequent target of destructive wildfires. The region in northern California “has had four of the largest 10 fires” in the state’s history, Cal Fire Incident Commander Billy See said at a news conference Eight of the 10 largest wildfires in California history have happened in the last five years. Scientists say the impacts from wildfires and other extreme weather events have worsened due to climate change. And undoubtedly, this new fire will reinvigorate debates about where and how we live and rebuild in an increasingly hot and dry Western United States. Last time he evacuated, in 2018, Mr Pero was home with his wife in Paradise. They had just 20 minutes to flee - but it was enough time to grab their photo albums, phones, computers, cars and cats. That fire ripped through Paradise at a truly unprecedented speed and heat - catching everyone off guard with its ferocity. Of the 85 people who perished, many died in their cars, trying to escape on the rural town’s windy, mountain roads. Paradise Police Sgt Rob Nichols was one of the many quick-thinking heroes that day. As fire engulfed the town, propane tanks exploded and power lines and burned-out cars blocked the road. His wife and young children got out safely, but Sgt Nichols stayed to help. Along with firefighters and volunteers, they smashed the windows of an empty building that had a large parking lot - a barrier that could prevent the building from burning - and hustled about 200 people inside as they watched in horror as their beloved mountain town burned. Sgt Nichols lost everything he owned. He still works in Paradise but he resettled with his family in Chico, about a mile from where the Park Fire ignited. Chico was where many of the Paradise evacuees headed in 2018 - many sleeping in tents around a Walmart or in camper vans until they could resettle elsewhere. Sgt Nichols was on vacation - 135 miles (217km) away in Lake Siskiyou - when he started hearing news that a wildfire was threatening his home. Again. “On our last evening up there, we couldn't rest not knowing what was going on and how close it was to the home,” he said. “So we came home.” Sgt Nichols didn't anticipate how scary it would be for his children, ages 12 and 13, as they arrived home and saw flames taking over an area on the ridge above their neighbourhood. “That was kind of a big trigger for them,” he said. Fortunately, their house was spared. The wind sent the blaze in the opposite direction. But it was close. He sometimes thinks about moving to a less fire prone area. “My wife has a lot of family here,” he said, noting the ties that have kept them in the area. “And, you know, we lost seven homes. Her family lost seven homes in the Camp Fire. And so we don't want to go too far.” Paradise is likely safer now than most places, he argues, because there just isn't much left to burn. He’d like to rebuild there, but building costs have skyrocketed and insurance is prohibitively expensive due to wildfires. Now Sgt Nichols is patrolling around Chico - on loan from Paradise police - to help deter looters or opportunists who attempt to raid communities after an evacuation order. Mr Pero saw his Forest Ranch house as a paradise away from Paradise because of its natural beauty and how close it kept him and his wife to the community they’d grown to love. He became serious, maybe obsessed, about fire safety and was in charge of his neighbourhood's fire mitigation. He says it’s “ironic” his home burned. He had about 50 yards of cleared space behind his house, a barrier he hoped would stop any potential blaze from continuing toward his oasis. “It had 60,000-gallon water tanks. It also had fire hydrants on the street,"" he said. ""And the big part, it was also about a one-minute route to get evacuated out on Highway 32 versus nine hours in Paradise.” Every year, they brought in hundreds of goats to clear brush, which can be like kindling for any fire, throughout the community. He urged his neighbours to make their homes fire safe by trimming trees and clearing brush. He’s hoping his lost cat - a striped grey and black feline named CatMandu - made it out alive. Mr Pero has been leaving out food and searching for him around the wreckage. But the charred remains of his home are still too toxic to walk around - he needs a special mask and suit to search for any sign of the cat or any belongings that survived the blaze. “I tried to look from the edges,” he said. “Didn't see anything.” Three other homes on his street also burned to the ground. They were owned by Paradise fire survivors, he says. He and his wife loved their time in Forest Ranch. But he doubts they will rebuild there. He says he doesn’t know if they can start over again in such a fire-prone area. They’re thinking maybe somewhere coastal - near water. Somewhere less dry. Somewhere safer. He knows people who have relocated to the rain-prone state of Oregon and the often-rainy Ireland. “We're kind of wide open now.” Donald Trump's lawyers presented ""no meaningful evidence"" he is being wrongly prosecuted, a judge has ruled. NBC hired Snoop Dogg as a special correspondent, but he has shown up for US athletes at the Olympics. The US gymnast and Rubik's cube enthusiast became an online sensation after earning two bronze medals at the Olympics. Iran says it will ""punish"" Israel for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. US defence secretary Lloyd Austin says he did not agree to deal and relieves officer overseeing court of authority. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

2,2024-08-04 07:36:36.000,BBC News,2024-08-04 05:36:28.000,Dressing the Dragon: 'The scale of it is huge',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2g203jln1o,2024-08-04 05:31:43.000,"“Hopefully the fans will be happy because we’re trying to be as loyal to the source material as we can be.” The season finale of House of the Dragon, a prequel to Game of Thrones, airs on Sunday, with millions of fantasy fanatics expected to tune in. Based on George RR Martin's novel, A Song of Ice and Fire, the HBO drama sees fiery beasts, battles and family feuds take centre stage. Behind the photo-realistic visual effects and intricate plots lies an immense effort in production with the show's costumes captivating audiences and critics. Emmy award-winning designer Caroline McCall from Portadown in County Armagh joined the show for its second season and plays a crucial role in bringing the fictional kingdom of Westeros to life. Fresh from her work on the BBC and HBO's fantasy drama His Dark Materials, Caroline said she was “really excited to try to get my teeth stuck into another one”. “I was excited by the scale of it, and slightly apprehensive when I got the job... [House of the Dragon] is a huge show with an amazing scope of design as a costume designer,” she told BBC News NI. “I was very excited to get the opportunity to pitch for the job.” Caroline was hired to replace renowned designer Jany Temime - best known for her work on the Harry Potter film series - who she said built a strong foundation for the series. “I had the benefit that there was already a really great costume team on board,"" she said. “A lot of the team already knew the workings of the show, so that was really helpful.” Born in County Armagh, Caroline found early inspiration at Belfast's Grand Opera House where theatre productions sparked her interest in costume design from a young age. After studying a foundation course at Ulster University, she then embarked on a three-year costume degree at Wimbledon School of Art in London. She then trained with the BBC, climbing her way up the industry before winning an Emmy in 2011 for her work on period drama Downton Abbey. This summer, she is celebrating her 25th year in the film industry, during which she has witnessed significant changes back home. Game of Thrones was primarily filmed on location in Northern Ireland and has sparked a film boom there. “I’m rather jealous that there’s an industry now,” she said. “I think it’s fantastic that it’s so well established. I have several team members from Northern Ireland who trained on Thrones.” House of the Dragon is set 200 years before Game Of Thrones, and follows the fortunes of the Targaryens - a noble family with the power to control dragons. With hundreds of costumes to oversee, where does a designer begin? “It’s huge,” Caroline said. “The fans of the show, and particularly those who have read the books, have got very firm ideas of how things should be. “The politics and the economics of these places have changed between our show and Game Of Thrones. “To dress people accordingly, basically in a redefined Westeros, was quite something to get my head around.” In season two, the houses have separated, “so there’s a natural reason to redesign quite a lot of the principle characters”, Caroline explained. Her research spanned “thousands of years of history” as she drew inspiration from cultures including the Roman and Byzantine Empires and the Mayans. “I took all this reference and sort of divvied it up in to what aesthetically worked for each house,"" she said. “For example, the Targaryen look, it’s sort of brutalist in style, in terms of it's adornment and embroidery, it’s more abstract, whereas the folks at Kings Landing are more naturalistic.” With a team of up to 300 people, costumes are painstakingly dyed, printed and decorated, often taking months to complete. The first series of House of the Dragon, much like its predecessor, faced some criticism for its dark cinematography, something that showrunner Ryan Condal has acknowledged and adjusted. “We went into season two very conscious of that feedback,” he told The Hollywood Reporter. The cinematography is something Caroline was very aware of as she produced her garments. “We tried before filming to look at colours on camera and in the environments that they would be in, to sort of make sure the greens were reading green or the blues were reading blue,” she said. “Some of the sets are really dark, and they should be, Dragonstone and Harrenhal don’t have a lot of natural light coming in.” House of the Dragon was one of the few US productions that continued to shoot during the Hollywood writers' and actors' strikes. For almost three months in 2023, industry writers and actors walked out in a dispute over fair pay and the use of artificial intelligence in the industry. But the House of the Dragon cast did not take part because the show was mainly filmed in the UK under contracts overseen by British union Equity, rather than its striking US counterpart the Screen Actors Guild. The show's writer Ryan Condal previously told the BBC it was a ""fraught period"", but a ""great privilege"" to keep the cast and crew employed. So what’s next for the designer, and the House of the Dragon? With details on season three kept tight-lipped, Caroline revealed that she will once again be working on the show, which she said will be her main focus for the next 14 months - albeit with a brief break for award season next year, one would assume. Could the show repeat previous successes at the Baftas, Golden Globes or Costume Designers Guild Awards? It’s not something the designer has given much thought. “You just have to do your best work and it all depends on what other productions are out…there’s an awful lot of fantasy and science fiction shows out this year,” she said. “We’ll see.” House of the Dragon's season two finale is available on Sky and NOW in the UK from 5 August. A new course at Ulster University aims to help care-experienced young people enter education. The application is seeking to improve the Grade II listed building's safety features. Areas including Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Bristol, Manchester, and Belfast saw unrest, with some buildings burned and police attacked.

2,2024-08-04 07:36:36.000,BBC News,2024-08-04 05:36:28.000,A bear mauled a Romanian teen to death. Will a cull solve the problem?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8vd26m4r86o,2024-08-03 00:01:39.000,"On 9 July, Diana Cazacu, a 19-year-old hiker, was mauled to death by a young female bear in the Bucegi mountains north of Bucharest. In response, the government overturned a 2016 moratorium on bear hunting - and reignited a fierce debate about what to do with Romania's growing bear population, the largest in Europe outside Russia. The staff at the Salvamont headquarters, Romania’s mountain rescue service, radiate calm and efficiency. When Diana and her boyfriend rang the emergency number, 112, in panic at 15:00 on 9 July, the call was transferred here. Sergiu Frusinoiu, in charge that day, set out immediately with two teams. One approached the incident spot from above, the other from below. Bears rarely attack humans, except in self-defence - so Sergiu assumed this would be a simple rescue mission. At the scene they found the woman’s distraught boyfriend. The bear had grabbed Diana, and thrown her down the ravine. They descended by rope, and found the bear standing over the victim. The bear attacked the rescue team, who defended themselves with pepper spray, firecrackers and rocks, until a hunter arrived and shot the bear. It was too late for Diana, lying on her stomach, her head in the stream. “Even if the fall or her injuries didn’t kill her, the water could have,” Sergiu told me. He said Diana's mistake had been to run away when faced with the bear. Sergiu grew up in these mountains, and has had hundreds of encounters with bears, without incident, he said. The standard advice is to make noise in bear territory as you walk. If you encounter a bear, stand quiet and still, then back slowly away. As with a dog, the worst thing you can do is run away, as it is sure to follow. At the base of the footpath which Diana climbed that day, it becomes clear why the bear was on the path. Three large municipal waste bins, the remains of a cage around one, stand open to the sky. One has been tipped over, and there is rotting food, tins and plastic strewn over a wide area. Around 8,000 bears live in the arc of the Carpathian mountains, one of Europe’s last wilderness regions, their habitat constantly eroded by logging, the spread of towns, and tourism. In the nearby town of Busteni, at seven in the evening, I get a bear alert on my phone, and rush to the scene, a residential street. Angry locals say they’re afraid to walk home at night, because of the bears. The police arrive, and the locals harangue them for doing too little. “But what do you want us to do?” asks a young officer. “Keep us safe!” shouts one man. I get through to the hunter who shot the bear who killed Diana, but he says he will not speak until the inquest is over. Former Environment Minister Barna Tanczos is the author of the new law, passed by the Chamber of Deputies and approved by President Klaus Iohannis in July, that allows people to kill up to 500 bears over the next 18 months . “The bear population is increasing daily, monthly, yearly in Romania, so if we don’t do something we will have thousands, tens of thousands of bears, which is not good for humans, and not good for the bears,"" Mr Tanczos said. ""So we have to establish control, we need a balance in human - bear relations, and conflicts, and contacts.” According to Cristi Remus Papp, head of the large carnivore department of the Worldwide Fund for Nature, the new law will do nothing to improve the situation, and could make it worse. There is a growing number of “troublesome” bears, he admits, but there are no accurate statistics for how many bears there are overall. In any case, the number is not the point, he says: “We have to address the root causes of the conflicts, starting with the mass feeding of bears close to settlements, and along the roads in tourist areas.” Since the communist era, hunters' associations are obliged by law to feed the bears - a practice initially meant to make them easier to shoot, and keep them out of towns, but is now partly done for tour operators, who want to guarantee a sighting of bears to their clients. Social media feeds are full of video clips of tourists feeding bears from their cars. A future change in the law could be to fine those who do so. Other bear management methods have been tried with some success - like tranquillising and removing bears to wild areas of the mountains. But now that bears have got into the habit of raiding bins or begging for food, even conservationists say there may be no alternative to culling them. One example of good practice is the town of Baile Tusnad. “In 2021 we had 220 bear alerts. This year so far, only 3,” Zsolt Butyka, the mayor told me proudly. His municipality bought 14 neat, stainless steel bear-proof bins, cut down 50 fruit trees in the town, and ran regular bear awareness campaign for the public. A poster near the town hall reads: “If you feed a bear, you kill a bear.” The town is on a main migration route for bears, across the Olt river valley, but now they skirt round the edges. “They’ve learnt there’s nothing for them here,” the mayor tells me. On a sultry summer evening, Janos Szin, a tour operator who runs a number of bear hides in the Tusnad area, sends me the map coordinates where to wait. A forest ranger in a four-wheel drive picks me up. Once we’re installed behind a large glass window in a raised hide, he produces a sack and scatters maize. The bears arrive while he is still there - two females, one with three cubs. After a while, a large male ambles up, and the others scatter. He climbs onto the scales, disguised as a feeding trough, and we see his weight: 240 kg (37 stone). In a phone conversation, Mr Szin tells me the law is bad. The “wrong bears” will be killed - the large males, minding their business up in the mountains. These males help keep the population down, he says, because they kill the cubs, so they can mate with their mothers. This is a common practice among lions in the wild, but experts disagree about its prevalence among bears. Poachers, trying to steal bear cubs, are another problem, Mr Szin suggests. He’s afraid that hunters from all over the world will now flock to Romania - the only place where they can bag a bear pelt and a skull, to hang on their walls. The charity is scaling back services to cope with maximum capacity and critically low funds. Lancashire Wildlife Trust says there has been a ""massive"" decline in the number of hedgehogs. Trail cameras and a keen eye for clues are used to check up on Northumberland's pine martens.

2,2024-08-04 07:36:36.000,BBC News,2024-08-04 05:36:28.000,"Kim Jong Un wants Trump back, elite defector tells BBC",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jqjwdyl1ko,2024-08-02 08:02:17.000,"Donald Trump returning to the White House would be “a once-in-a-thousand-year opportunity” for North Korea, according to a man in a unique position to know. Ri Il Kyu is the highest-ranking defector to escape North Korea since 2016 and has been face to face with Kim Jong Un on seven separate occasions. The former diplomat, who was working in Cuba when he fled with his family to South Korea last November, admits to ""shivering with nerves"" the first time he met Kim Jong Un. But during each meeting, he found the leader to be “smiling and in a good mood”. “He praised people often and laughed. He seems like an ordinary person,” Mr Ri tells the BBC. But he is in no doubt Mr Kim would do anything to guarantee his survival, even if it meant killing all 25 million of his people: “He could have been a wonderful person and father, but turning him into a god has made him a monstrous being.” In his first interview with an international broadcaster, Mr Ri provides a rare understanding of what one of the world’s most secretive and repressive states is hoping to achieve. He says that North Korea still views Mr Trump as someone it can negotiate with over its nuclear weapons programme, despite talks between him and Kim Jong Un breaking down in 2019. Mr Trump has previously hailed the relationship with Kim as a key achievement of his presidency. He famously said the two “fell in love” exchanging letters. Just last month, he told a rally Mr Kim would like to see him back in office: “I think he misses me, if you want to know the truth.” North Korea is hoping it can use this close personal relationship to its advantage, says Mr Ri, contradicting an official statement from Pyongyang last month that it “did not care” who became president. The nuclear state will never get rid of its weapons, Mr Ri says, and would probably seek a deal to freeze its nuclear programme in return for the US lifting sanctions. But he says Pyongyang would not negotiate in good faith. Agreeing to freeze its nuclear programme “would be a ploy, 100% deception”, he says, adding that this was therefore a “dangerous approach” which would “only lead to the strengthening of North Korea”. Eight months after his defection, Ri Il Kyu is living with his family in South Korea. Accompanied by a police bodyguard and two intelligence agents, he explains his decision to abandon his government. After years of being ground down by the corruption, bribery and lack of freedom he faced, Mr Ri says he was finally tipped over the edge when his request to travel to Mexico to get an operation on a slipped disc in his neck was denied. “I lived the life of the top 1% in North Korea, but that is still worse than a middle-class family in the South."" As a diplomat in Cuba, Mr Ri made just $500 (£294) a month and so would sell Cuban cigars illegally in China to make enough to support his family. When he first told his wife about his desire to defect, she was so disturbed she ended up in hospital with heart problems. After that, he kept his plans secret, only sharing them with her and his child six hours before their plane was due to depart. He describes it as a “life-or-death gamble”. Regular North Koreans who are caught defecting would typically be tortured for a few months, then released, he says. “But for elites like us, there are only two outcomes - life in a political prison camp or being executed by a firing squad."" “The fear and terror were overwhelming. I could accept my own death, but I could not bear the thought of my family being dragged to a gulag,” he says. Although Mr Ri had never believed in God, as he waited nervously at the airport gate in the middle of the night, he began to pray. The last known high-profile defection to the South was that of Tae Yong-ho in 2016. A former deputy ambassador to the UK, he was recently named the new leader of South Korea's presidential advisory council on unification. Turning to North Korea’s recent closer ties with Russia, Mr Ri says the Ukraine war had been a stroke of luck for Pyongyang. The US and South Korea estimate the North has sold Moscow millions of rounds of ammunition to support its invasion, in return for food, fuel and possibly even military technology. Mr Ri says the main benefit of this deal for Pyongyang was the ability to continue developing its nuclear weapons. With the deal, Russia created a ""loophole"" in the stringent international sanctions on North Korea, he says, which has allowed it “to freely develop its nuclear weapons and missiles and strengthen its defence, while bypassing the need to appeal to the US for sanctions relief”. But Mr Ri says Kim Jong Un understands this relationship is temporary and that after the war, Russia is likely to sever relations. For this reason, Mr Kim has not given up on the US, Mr Ri says. “North Korea understands that the only path to its survival, the only way to eliminate the threat of invasion and develop its economy, is to normalise relations with the United States."" While Russia might have given North Korea a temporary respite from its economic pain, Mr Ri says the complete closure of North Korea’s borders during the pandemic “severely devastated the country’s economy and people’s lives”. When the borders reopened in 2023 and diplomats were preparing to return, Mr Ri says families back home had asked them to “bring anything and everything you have, even your used toothbrushes, because there is nothing left in North Korea”. The North Korean leader demands total loyalty from his citizens and the mere whiff of dissent can result in imprisonment. But Mr Ri says years of hardship had eroded people’s loyalty, as no-one now expected to receive anything from their “Supreme Leader” Kim Jong Un. “There is no genuine loyalty to the regime or to Kim Jong Un anymore, it is a forced loyalty, where one must be loyal or face death,” he says. Recent change has largely been driven by an influx of South Korean films, dramas and music, which have been smuggled into the North and are illegal to watch and listen to. “People don’t watch South Korean content because they have capitalist beliefs, they are simply trying to pass the time in their monotonous and bleak lives,” Mr Ri says, but then they begin to ask, “Why do those in the South live the life of a first-world country while we are impoverished?"" But Mr Ri says that although South Korean content was changing North Korea, it would not bring about its collapse, because of the systems of control in place. “Kim Jong Un is very aware that loyalty is waning, that people are evolving, and that’s why he is intensifying his reign of terror,” he says. The government has introduced laws to harshly punish those who consume and distribute South Korean content. The BBC spoke to one defector last year who said he had witnessed someone be executed after sharing South Korean music and TV shows. North Korea’s decision, at the end of last year, to abandon a decades-old policy of eventually reunifying with the South, was a further attempt to isolate people from the South, Mr Ri says. He describes this as Kim Jong Un’s “most evil act”, because all North Koreans dream of reunification. He says that while North Korea’s past leaders had “stolen people’s freedom, money and human rights, Kim Jong Un has robbed what was left of them: hope”. Outside North Korea, much attention is paid to Kim Jong Un’s health, with some believing that his premature death could trigger the collapse of the regime. Earlier this week, South Korea’s intelligence agency estimated that Mr Kim weighed 140kg, putting him at risk of cardiovascular disease. But Mr Ri believes the system of surveillance and control is now too well established for Kim’s death to threaten the dictatorship. “Another evil leader will merely take his place,” he says. It has been widely speculated that Mr Kim is grooming his young daughter, thought to be called Ju Ae, to be his successor, but Mr Ri dismisses the notion. Ju Ae, he says, lacks the legitimacy and popularity to become the leader of North Korea, especially as the sacred Paektu bloodline, which the Kims use to justify their rule, is believed to run only through the men of the family. At first, people were fascinated by Ju Ae, Mr Ri says, but not any more. They question why she was attending missile tests rather than going to school, and wearing luxury, designer clothes instead of her school uniform, like other children. Rather than waiting for Mr Kim to become ill or die, Mr Ri says the international community has to come together, including North Korea’s allies China and Russia, to “persistently persuade it to change”. “This is the only thing that will bring about the end of the North Korean dictatorship,"" he adds. Mr Ri is hoping that his defection inspires his peers, not to defect themselves, but to push for small changes from the inside. He does not have lofty ambitions, that North Koreans will be able to vote or travel, merely that they can choose what jobs to work, have enough food to eat and be able to share their opinions freely among friends. For now, though, his priority is helping his family settle into their new life in South Korea and for his child to assimilate into society. At the end of our interview, he poses a scenario. “Imagine I offer you a venture and tell you, if we succeed we win big, but if we fail it means death. “You wouldn’t agree, would you? Well that is the choice I forced upon my family, and they silently agreed and followed me,” he says. “This is now a debt I must repay for the rest of my life.” Additional reporting by Jake Kwon and Hosu Lee Donald Trump's lawyers presented ""no meaningful evidence"" he is being wrongly prosecuted, a judge has ruled. The two candidates trade barbs as broadcasters negotiate details of new debates ahead of the November election. The figure was released as students returned to the streets demanding justice for those killed. The 21-year-old says he changed his mind hours after vowing not to support Trump due to his guns stance. The genre has been around for decades, but its traditional duets appear to be making a return.

2,2024-08-04 07:36:36.000,BBC News,2024-08-04 05:36:28.000,Beauty contest sparks row over who counts as South African,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn38ppr4zj0o,2024-08-03 00:10:47.000,"When law student Chidimma Adetshina clinched a coveted spot as a Miss South Africa finalist, her triumph unleashed a vicious backlash, unearthing a seam of xenophobia that lies close to the surface for some in the country. The 23-year-old’s name hints at her connection to Nigeria, but internet detectives wanted to know more and combed through every inch of her life. They found that her father is Nigerian and though her mother is South African, her family had come from neighbouring Mozambique. ""On behalf of South Africans, we don’t recognise her and that name! She better start packing and go home,” raged one commenter on X. But where is home? Ms Adetshina is South African, as verified by the organisers of the pageant. She has said in interviews that she was born in Soweto - the township next to Johannesburg - and grew up in Cape Town. However, the “go-home” sentiment, and even harsher attacks, flooded social media. There was also a petition demanding her removal from the high-profile televised competition that amassed more than 14,000 signatures before it was taken down. The country’s Culture Minister Gayton McKenzie, the leader of the Patriotic Alliance party, which has joined a coalition government and made migration issues a key part of its platform, chimed in. “We truly cannot have Nigerians compete in our Miss SA competition. I wanna get all facts before I comment but it gives funny vibes already,"" he said on X. The issue has touched a nerve in South Africa that goes beyond who will appear on stage at the final next weekend. Ms Adetshina declined a BBC request for an interview but she did tell the Sowetan Live news site that the online hate she was facing made her think twice about competing. ""I am representing a country, but I don’t feel the love from the people I’m representing,"" she said. Ms Adetshina added that the whole situation felt like ""black-on-black hate"", highlighting a particular strain of xenophobia in South Africa known as ""afrophobia"", which targets other Africans. She felt that she was not the only contestant among the last 16 women with a name that had origins from beyond the country’s shores - there are some with South Asian and European names - yet she was receiving the bulk of the criticism. Asked to respond to the comments that Ms Adetshina has faced, a Miss South Africa spokesperson did not address them directly but simply said that she was eligible to take part in the competition. This was not the first time that this has happened. For Melissa Nayimuli, a Miss South Africa contestant last year, it has brought up difficult memories. The 28-year-old was the target of the same vitriol heaped on Ms Adetshina because her father is Ugandan. She told the BBC she was unsurprised at the reaction she had received as she had experienced it for most of her life. “It’s something I tried to run away from, but how do you run away from yourself?” she questioned. Ms Nayimuli said that while growing up she would constantly speak Xhosa, her mother tongue and one of South Africa’s official languages, to “prove her South African-ness”. Her voice cracked as she admitted that she felt shame at her Ugandan identity when she was younger because of the afrophobia that she experienced. ""I would not want to be seen with my father because of his darker skin and East African features were a dead giveaway,"" she told the BBC. ""At home my father was my hero, but outside I saw him treated as an enemy."" University of the Free State sociologist Dr Nombulelo Shange links this hostility to South Africa's history of racism and the apartheid system - which imposed a strict hierarchy that privileged white people. There is a ""sad apartheid mentality that we are struggling to shake as a country"", she said. ""It shows the deep self-hate that we as black South Africans carry with us."" Dr Shange added that South Africans had internalised oppressive racist reasoning such as colourism, where lighter skin tones are perceived as better. After apartheid ended in 1994, the government led by Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC) welcomed African migrants and asylum seekers to the country in part to aid its reintegration into the continent after years of isolation. But with many South Africans struggling financially, foreigners became the target for some frustrated by their situation. Zimbabweans, Nigerians and Somalis, among others, have been accused of taking opportunities and resources from South Africans. There is a “perception of outsiders as competitors for scarce jobs, resources, living space and services”, Michael Morris, head of media at the South African Institute of Race Relations, told the BBC. He said the growing number of Africans succeeding in South Africa could “easily trigger resentment and violence”. This climate of hostility has occasionally erupted into attacks. South Africa experienced its worst outbreak of violence against mostly African foreigners in 2008, when more than 60 people died. “There are black South Africans who will argue that Africans from elsewhere in the continent don’t belong in South Africa,"" Mr Morris said. More than a decade ago, Ms Nayimuli felt this animosity acutely when her father was arrested. ""My dad is the most kind-hearted, gentle soul in the entire universe,"" she said - yet he was treated like a criminal because, she believes, he looked like a foreigner. When Ms Nayimuli’s mother reached the police station in the capital, Pretoria, where her husband was being held officers did not even have an explanation or a charge against him. Her father was released and Ms Nayimuli’s family never spoke about it again. They had often ""tiptoed"" around the xenophobia they faced but when it bubbled up during last year’s Miss South Africa it was a chance for them to address the issue directly and was, for Ms Nayimuli, part of a healing process. Now, seeing Ms Adetshina experience the same level of abuse her heart goes out to her. ""She is not just a trending topic. She is a human being. She is a young woman getting bullied online - it's wrong, hurtful and so dangerous,"" she said. But she emphasised that the xenophobes are a small minority and there are many South Africans who call for unity. Leader of the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party Julius Malema defended Ms Adetshina last week, saying: “Why do people want to say she’s from Nigeria or Mozambique? She was born here.” This message of coming together is one that Ms Nayimuli ended her Miss South Africa journey on. Last year, as the bright lights shone on her during the final round of the competition, she called for African unity in the face of hate. “Let’s step into our power as Africa. We are one,” she said to a raucous auditorium who cheered on her message of togetherness. But it seems it did not take root as the discrimination has resurfaced. Next Saturday, Ms Adetshina will get her chance to take to the stage, but it is not yet clear if she will tackle the haters head on. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

2,2024-08-04 07:36:36.000,BBC News,2024-08-04 05:36:28.000,"Whisper it, but is now a good time to holiday in Paris?",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7970gz3qro,2024-08-02 12:44:05.000,"For all those concerns about high prices and big crowds ahead of the Olympics, now might just be an unexpectedly good time to holiday in Paris. Hotels and restaurants have told the BBC they have dropped their prices to entice customers - after what some call a “catastrophic” downturn in takings during the Games that have left them asking what the event has done for them. The French capital might seem to be the centre of the world for those watching the sport on TV – but the city’s relatively quiet streets and empty dining tables tell a different story. Earlier this week, local media ran reports of a “deserted” Disneyland and of Parisians’ bemusement as they managed to secure seats on metro trains at rush hour. So, what is happening? Analysts suggest that many Parisians have left the city in droves for the summer, as is their tradition. But also, some overseas visitors have been put off by concerns around price-gouging and overcrowding on an Olympic scale. One of the locals who used the word “catastrophic” was a restaurateur called Lies in the usually bustling Latin Quarter, who said July had been his worst month for 25 years. During the height of Covid, at least people continued to order meal deliveries, he told the BBC. Tourists had been put off coming to the area because of security blockades that were put in the place for the previous week’s opening ceremony, Lies suggested. Another nearby restaurateur hovering in his doorway, Yarva, said would-be visitors had chosen not to pay hotel prices which multiplied several times ahead of the Games. The event was “only for the rich”, he said, and used a hand gesture to indicate he thought the price inflation had been crazy. Ahead of the Games, airlines warned there was a low appetite for journeys to Paris, with both Delta and the company that owns Air France predicting an impact on their business. “Unless you’re going to the Olympics, people aren’t going to Paris,” the Delta boss told CNBC. This was reflected in flight prices that were well below the usual asking price for this time of year, according to travel expert Simon Calder, writing this week for The Independent. Next-day one-way flights from UK cities were as low as £31 (€36; $39) per adult (from Edinburgh) at the time of writing this article. However, tickets for the Eurostar trains, which were last week affected by a sabotage attack on the French railway network, were considerably higher. June and July saw an “avoidance effect”, said Raphael Batko of hotel marketing firm Doyield, which represents about one in 20 of the city’s hotels. He also used the word “catastrophic” to describe the phenomenon, though he said visitor numbers had picked up and were now satisfactory. A similar avoidance phenomenon has been noticed in previous Olympics, including in London in 2012, when businesses suggested that the Games had deterred visitors and shrunk their profits. What remains to be seen is whether the emergency action taken by the hospitality industry will be enough to salvage the Olympic trade for many Parisian businesses. With restaurants dropping their prices, it was now possible to get a meal for as little as €8 (£6.80, $8.70) in the Latin Quarter, claimed Riad, the proprietor of the Olympie diner, as he tried to entice diners. Hotels, too have tried a similar trick – largely reversing the earlier rises which appear to have been so off-putting. Tourism authorities confirmed that average prices had returned to €258 (£219; $279) per night during the Games, following a massive hike that had previously seen them peak at €342 last month. The BBC saw that a number of Airbnbs on offer were advertising price reductions, although the company said prices had remained stable since the start of the year, and more locals had been opening their homes in host cities. Individual hoteliers in Paris spoke of mixed success. One reception manager, Dino, said bookings had reached normal levels - but only after rates were slashed by half when things “looked bleak”. Another, Isabelle, said her own price drop had been ineffective and lamented that “we didn’t gain anything from the Olympics”. As well as the sport, there were plenty of good reasons to come to the French capital for the summer, said Christophe Decloux, head of the Choose Paris regional tourist board. He cited the city’s rich cultural offering, plus smooth transportation and a “very joyful” atmosphere during the Games. “Paris is usually very calm in late July and August because people leave for the holidays,” he said, “and right now it is just as calm as usual in August except in some areas around the venues where people are bonding over the sport.” Organisers of Paris 2024 have trumpeted the positive effects of the Games on Paris following record ticket sales. It remains possible to sign up to see events, as tickets are released each day. About 800,000 of them are still up for grabs, organisers told the BBC on Friday. The sporting spectacle itself has already proven memorable - and with some disgruntled businesses doing everything they can to coax in visitors, last-minute bookers to Paris might find themselves in with a chance of scoring a bargain.

1,2024-08-05 07:36:42.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-05 04:51:06.000,Markets digest bank earnings after recent turmoil,https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/stock-market-bank-earnings/index.html,2023-04-14 20:00:28.000,"Our live coverage for the day has ended. Follow the latest business news here or read through the updates below. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm, slashed Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink’s pay by 30% to $25.2 million for 2022, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The move comes after the money manager reported first-quarter revenue that was down 10% from a year ago, as rising interest rates and economic uncertainty impacted the firm’s bottom line. “With respect to 2022 compensation, management determined to reduce the impact of the firm’s decline in profitability on BlackRock’s broader employee population by concentrating the downward adjustments to total incentive awards toward senior management,” the filing said. Total compensation for Fink, 70, included a base salary of $1.5 million and $23.7 million in total incentive awards. Several other executives saw their compensation reduced, including Rob Kapito, the firm’s president, whose package shrank by 34% to $18.95 million. UBS’ purchase of Credit Suisse’s US subsidiaries can move forward, the Federal Reserve said Friday. The statement comes a month after UBS stepped in to rescue the embattled Swiss lender and prevent turmoil in the financial sector from spreading, after an emergency loan of nearly $54 billion from the Swiss National Bank failed to stop the carnage. The problems for Credit Suisse began when the Saudi National Bank, its largest backer, said it wouldn’t put up more cash after buying a nearly 10% stake in the bank for $1.5 billion in 2022. Banking customers were already on edge after the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank — so Credit Suisse shares tumbled more than 25% and saw billions of dollars of outflows. The global turmoil has led US lawmakers to call for tighter regulations on banks. The Fed board said UBS will provide a quarterly updated plan for combining UBS’s and Credit Suisse’s US business and operations. “The implementation plan will address UBS’s obligations to comply with more stringent enhanced prudential standards, including liquidity standards,” the Fed said in a statement. UBS is shelling out 3 billion Swiss francs, or $3.25 billion, for Credit Suisse. Stocks slid Friday after a slate of earnings beats from big banks fueled concerns that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its next two meetings. Still, the major indices gained for the week. The Dow rose 400 points, or 1.2%. The S&P 500 gained 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.3%. JPMorgan Chase on Friday reported first-quarter profit and revenue that crushed expectations, boosted by the Fed’s interest rate hiking campaign. Citigroup, Wells Fargo and PNC Financial also reported strong results. CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors in the company’s post-earnings conference call that they should prepare for interest rates to be higher for longer than expected. Wall Street seems to have taken note. Analysts increased their bets on a quarter-point rate hike at the Fed’s meeting in May and another in June. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Friday that the central bank needs to continue tightening monetary policy, further weighing down markets. Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said that it’s “definitely” possible the United States enters a mild recession after the tumult in banking last month. Meanwhile, retail sales data declined more than expected, suggesting that Americans’ spending power and the US economy are weakening. Consumer sentiment held fairly steady in April, even as concerns about a recession linger, according to the University of Michigan’s latest monthly survey. “There was too much news to digest this morning, but the key takeaway is that the Fed has room to do more harm,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, said in a note. The Dow slipped 144 points, or 0.4%. The S&P 500 tumbled 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite sank 0.4%. As stocks settle after the trading day, levels might still change slightly. Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said Friday he isn’t discounting the recent assessment from central bank economists that the banking crisis will tip the United States into a mild recession later this year. “There’s no way you can look at current conditions around the world and in the US and not think that some mild recession is definitely on the table as a possibility,” Goolsbee said Friday during an interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” He added that, when viewed historically, the monetary tightening campaign undertaken by the Fed — hiking interest rates nine times in just over a year — is expected to slow GDP growth. “When you get numbers like retail sales and others that are declining, if you look at construction, I think we’ve got to think about what’s the state of growth in the country,” he said. “Fortunately, the labor market continues to be very strong.” Critics have lambasted the World Bank and, particularly, the International Monetary Fund, for predicting Russia’s economy would hold relatively stable this year despite international sanctions. But sanctions are hurting Russia’s economy, even if World Bank forecasts don’t reflect it, according to the outgoing World Bank President David Malpass. Speaking to Julia Chatterley at the IMF-World Bank spring conference, David Malpass responded to criticism that you couldn’t trust GDP and economic data from Russia. He admitted “the quality of the data differs substantially by country…the reality is there’s not very much in terms of double checking of data”. In January, the IMF projected that Russia’s economy would expand by 0.3% this year and 2.1% the next. That was much more optimistic than the latest forecasts from the World Bank, which still penciled in a contraction of just 3.3% this year. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development was the most pessimistic, forecasting a 5.6% contraction in Russia’s economy in 2023. Malpass said that GDP numbers were not capturing the “reality” and “horror” of the war, and noted the Russian economy was suffering. “I think life is hard in Russia…they’re excluded from travelling to many parts of the world, their supply chains have to change dramatically… young people moving out because they don’t want to be part of this war,” Malpass said. Consumer sentiment tracked by the University of Michigan held steady in April, according to a preliminary reading released Friday. So far, the university’s monthly surveys have shown a limited impact from the banking crisis on consumers’ attitudes, but Americans remain concerned about an upcoming recession and some lingering fears about inflation persist. “Consumers are expecting a downturn, they’re not feeling as dismal as they were last summer, but they’re waiting for the other shoe to drop,” said Joanne Hsu, director of the surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan, in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Friday morning. “We now have about a month of data following the collapse of SVB, and there hasn’t really been much of an effect on sentiment at all,” she said. The latest survey also showed that higher gas prices helped push up year-ahead inflation expectations by a full percentage point, rising from 3.6% in March to 4.6% in April. “Consumers are still feeling the pain of high prices,” Hsu told Bloomberg, noting that survey respondents were now mentioning gas prices for the first time since fall. The latest cooldown in consumer and producer price hikes as well as the latest decline in retail sales are indications that the Federal Reserve’s efforts are working to bring down high inflation, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee told CNBC on Friday. “You don’t want to overreact to short-run news, but it feel likes like that’s moving in the right direction,” he said during an appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” Goolsbee was quick to note that an area of critical importance to him in advance of the next Fed meeting is activity in banking and credit. Earlier this week, Goolsbee noted that the Fed needs to be “on watch” for tighter credit conditions as a result of the banking turmoil last month. He referenced private sector analyst estimates that the spillover effects of the crisis equate to the Fed enacting rate hikes anywhere from a quarter point to three-quarters of a point. “I’m an old-school data dog,” Goolsbee said Friday. “What I would do is spend the next three weeks getting out and figuring out how much credit tightening is coming.” Chief executives at some of the largest banks in the United States were forced to address the elephant in the room as they reported first-quarter earnings on Friday morning: The regional banking crisis that brought Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank to ruin last month. > Banking industry turmoil has added to risks of recessionary “storm clouds” on the horizon, said JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon Friday in a release. He added that “the banking situation is distinct from 2008 as it has involved far fewer financial players and fewer issues that need to be resolved.” Still, said Dimon, who leads the country’s largest bank, “financial conditions will likely tighten as lenders become more conservative, and we do not know if this will slow consumer spending.” >“We are glad to have been in a strong position to help support the US financial system during the recent events that impacted the banking industry,” commented Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf in a statement. “Regional and community banks are an important part of our financial system and are uniquely positioned to serve their customers and communities.” > “I believe today’s crisis of confidence in the regional banking sector will further accelerate capital markets growth, and BlackRock will be a central player,” wrote BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on Friday. “Increased financing through the capital markets will require the scale, multi-asset capabilities and excellence in portfolio construction that BlackRock consistently delivers across market cycles,” he said in a statement. That means bad news for regional banks could be good news for BlackRock – the lack of trust in regional banks will drive more investment into capital markets and BlackRock is poised to benefit as that happens. “Throughout our history, moments of market dislocation and disruption have served as inflection points for BlackRock,” he explained. Regulators also hired BlackRock in early April to help the US government in the sale of the $114 billion in assets it collected from the collapse> Citigroup and PNC did not address the banking crisis in their releases, but will likely answer questions about how they’ve weathered the turmoil and what they see ahead at their first-quarter presentations, planned for 11 a.m. ET. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors Friday not to be caught unawares if interest rates stay higher longer than expected. “People need to be prepared. They shouldn’t pray that they don’t go up. They should prepare for them going up. And if it doesn’t happen, serendipity,” Dimon said on the company’s post-earnings conference call. High interest rates have helped big banks, including JPMorgan Chase, since they widen the gap between the interest paid to customers and what they earn from investing that money. But climbing rates also helped drive last month’s collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which held 55% of its customers deposits in long-dated bonds whose value diminished as interest rates rose. Dimon stated that he believes the banking crisis will pass — even though he expects its effects to reverberate through the sector for years to come — but that the possibility of higher interest rates should remain on companies’ radars. “If and when that happens, it will address problems in the economy. For those who are too exposed to floating rates, or those who are too exposed to [refinancing] risk, those exposures will be in multiple parts of the economy,” Dimon said. “Now would be the time to fix it. Do not put yourself in a position where that risk is excessive for your company, your business, your investment pools,” he said. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the largest US bank, told investors Friday that he isn’t too worried about a credit crunch resulting from the recent banking crisis. “I wouldn’t use the word[s] ‘credit crunch,’” he said in response to a question about whether he was worried that lending would tighten in the bank after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. There will be “a little bit of tightening,” said Dimon, but that will mostly be contained within the real estate market. Dimon added that he’s more worried about recession than a credit crunch. “I just look at it as a kind of a thumb on the scale. It just makes the financing conditions a little bit tighter and increases the odds of a recession,” he said. “That’s what that is. It’s not like a credit crunch.” JPMorgan Chase said Friday its exposure to the office sector is limited, addressing concerns about the commercial real estate industry’s stability. “Given the recent focus on commercial real estate, let me remind you that our office sector exposure is less than 10% of our portfolio and is focused in urban dense markets, and nearly two-thirds of our loans are multifamily, primarily in supply-constrained markets,” said Jeremy Barnum, chief financial officer, in the company’s post-earnings conference call. Investors and regulators are watching the $20 trillion US commercial real estate market for signs that it could be the next shoe to drop after the banking tumult last month. That’s partly because the value of buildings is going down, particularly as offices in major cities remain vacant or half-empty as Americans opt to work from home. The commercial real estate industry’s woes come after decades of unbridled growth powered by low interest rates and easy credit. That upward trend was interrupted by the Covid pandemic’s onset, and then when the Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates aggressively last year to stabilize the economy. “There are obviously some big things here and there to pay attention to, but in the scheme of things for us, not a big issue,” Barnum said. Spending at US retailers fell in March as consumers pulled back amid recessionary fears fueled by the banking crisis. Retail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation, fell by 1% in March from the prior month, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. That was steeper than an expected 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv, and above the revised 0.2% decline in the prior month. The drop was driven by a pullback in spending at department stores and on durable goods such as appliances and furniture. Spending at general merchandise stores fell 3% in March from the prior month and spending at gas stations declined 5.5% during the same period. Excluding gas station sales, retail spending retreated 0.6% in March from February. However, year-on-year retail spending rose 2.9%. Citigroup shares were up about 0.8% in premarket trading after the bank posted strong first-quarter profits, beating analyst expectations for both earnings per share and revenue. The bank brought in $21.4 billion in revenue versus expectations of $19.9 billion. Earnings per share were $2.19, estimates were for $1.67. Citi CEO Jane Fraser and CFO Mark Mason will hold an earnings presentation at 11 a.m. ET. Stocks slid Friday, even as big banks reported beats on their first-quarter earnings in an auspicious start to earnings season. Investors were watching for clues about the financial sector’s stability, and whether the tumult in the sector last month could lead to tighter lending standards. A key point of interest was also how much big banks benefitted from increased deposit inflows when nervous customers fled from regional banks after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. JPMorgan, the largest bank in the United States and an economic bellwether, posted record revenue. Wells Fargo, Citigroup and PNC Financial Services also reported earnings beats. Shares of JPMorgan Chase gained 4.8%, Wells Fargo rose 0.7%, Citigroup added 1.9% and PNC Financial Services ticked up 0.3%. Meanwhile, retail sales came in weaker than expected as recession fears loom. Retail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation, fell by 1% in March from the month before, according to the Commerce Department. Economists expected a 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv. The Dow fell 38 points, or about 0.1%. The S&P 500 sank 0.1%. The Nasdaq Composite declined 0.5%. The Federal Reserve could end its historic rate-hiking campaign after just one more quarter-point increase, said Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic in a Thursday interview with Reuters. The Fed has approved nine rate hikes in a row since last March, the effects of which are only now starting to “bite,” Bostic said. Monetary policy can take months to trickle through the economy, but a slew of recent data suggests that inflation is finally cooling. The March Consumer Price Index shows price hikes have slowed for nine months in a row, and headline wholesale inflation reflected in the Producer Price Index has sunk to 2.7% after reaching double digit highs last year. Bostic said the recent “chaos” in the banking sector, after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, persuaded him to rethink the pace of rate hikes. However, he told Reuters he believes the turmoil will not have any lasting impact on the the US economy. Analysts expect the Fed to raise rates by a quarter point at its upcoming policy meeting on May 2-3, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Regional bank PNC Financial reported first-quarter revenue of $5.6 billion and earnings per share of $3.98 vs. expectations of $3.66. Shares rose 5% on the news. Wells Fargo reported first-quarter revenue of $20.7 billion against expectations of $20.1 billion. The San Francisco-based bank saw earnings of $4.9 billion, up from $3.8 billion a year earlier, an increase of about 32%. Shares of Wells Fargo rose 2.2%. JPMorgan Chase on Friday reported first-quarter profit and revenue that roundly beat expectations, boosted by a year of rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. The New York-based bank posted a profit of $12.6 billion or $4.10 per share. That’s up from $8.3 billion, or $2.63 per share from the same period a year before. Analysts expected earnings of $3.41 per share, according to Refinitiv. With $3.67 trillion in assets, JPMorgan Chase is the largest bank in the United States and a bellwether for the US economy. “The US economy continues to be on generally healthy footings — consumers are still spending and have strong balance sheets, and businesses are in good shape. However, the storm clouds that we have been monitoring for the past year remain on the horizon,” CEO Jamie Dimon said in a press release. Net interest income rose to $20.8 billion, up 49% from the prior year, driven by the aggressive interest rate campaign the Fed kicked off last year to stabilize prices. Deposits rose to $2.38 trillion during the first quarter from $2.34 trillion in the quarter ended in December. That comes after the banking tumult last month triggered a rush into big banks from nervous customers. Investors also looked to money market funds as a haven. A key point of conversation after last month’s turmoil in the banking sector has been whether banks could tighten lending standards, leading customers to spend less as it becomes more difficult to borrow money for large purchases like homes and cars. “Financial conditions will likely tighten as lenders become more conservative, and we do not know if this will slow consumer spending,” Dimon said, adding that JPMorgan Chase is “confident that we can serve the needs of our customers and clients in all environments.” Shares of JPMorgan Chase climbed 6.1% in pre-market trading. The company’s post-earnings conference call is slated for 8:30 a.m. ET. Stocks: US stock futures fell ahead of several bank earnings this morning. Investors also fretted a retail sales report that is expected to show consumers are pulling back on their spending. Dow futures were down 75 points, or 0.2%. S&P 500 futures fell 0.2%. Nasdaq futures were 0.4% lower. European stocks were higher and Asian stocks closed up. Fear & Greed Index: 67 = Greed Oil & gas: US oil prices were up 0.3% to $82 a barrel. Average US gas prices rose to $3.66 a gallon. Wall Street is searching for answers to two key questions: Is the economy headed for a recession? And, if so, who’s poised to weather it? Recession fears have ramped up in recent weeks after the banking tumult last month raised concerns about the financial sector’s health. Earnings season for banks starts on Friday with JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, BlackRock, Citigroup and PNC Financial Services slated to report before the bell. Investors will be watching for clues about stability. Stocks have yet to price in the economy’s precarious position, with the S&P 500 adding about 7% this year. But markets have already seen volatile trading since then. “We’re going to see a correction happen here, because it just never makes sense when the market’s going up and earnings are going down,” says Eric Sterner, chief investment officer at Apollon Wealth Management. But while earnings are an undeniable factor driving markets, inflation remains a key concern. Wall Street remains overly optimistic that the Fed will cut rates later this year — even after officials indicated last month that they likely won’t — or that it could even orchestrate a soft landing. That hope, and the market’s resilience, could start to crumble in the next few weeks, said Megan Horneman, chief investment officer at Verdence Capital Advisors. “You very well could see that catalyst over the next couple of weeks with earnings, and then this inflation data and then what the Fed says when they meet,” said Horneman. Jeremy Grantham made his name predicting the dot-com crash in 2000 and the financial crisis in 2008. Now, the famous investor warns another epic bubble in financial markets is bursting — and the turmoil that swept through the banking sector last month is just the beginning. “Other things will break, and who knows what they will be,” Grantham told CNN in an exclusive interview. “We’re by no means finished with the stress to the financial system.” Since early 2022, when the S&P 500 hit an all-time high, US stocks have dropped about 15% as central banks have jacked up borrowing costs. But Grantham sees much steeper declines on the horizon. The “best we can hope for,” he said, is a fall of about 27% from current levels, while the worst-case scenario would see a plunge of more than 50%. The low point might not arrive until “deep into next year,” he added. Grantham sees uncomfortable parallels between markets today and 2000, when an explosion in the price of tech stocks was followed by a dizzying crash. There are also echoes of 2008, when a painful comedown in the US housing market almost broke the banking system. What’s even more worrying is that this time, bubbles in the stock market and the real estate market are poised to burst simultaneously, Grantham said. The broader US banking system remains sound and stable, but the two regional banks that failed were “poorly managed” and “took unacceptable risks,” White House economic adviser Lael Brainard told CNN’s Poppy Harlow in an interview Wednesday at Semafor’s World Economy Summit in Washington, DC. Last month’s collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank roiled markets and spread fear through the economy of a possible wider banking crisis. The US Treasury, Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation all intervened to ensure bank customers could access all their money and to attempt to stave off future bank runs. “The banking system, it’s very sound, it’s stable; the core of the banking system has a great deal of capital that was put in place in the wake of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis,” said Brainard, director of the White House National Economic Council. “There were some banks who were not managing their risks effectively. They failed, and the president took strong actions along with the Secretary of the Treasury and the banking regulators,” she said. “Those actions reassured Americans their deposits are safe, the banking system is sound; but it was also important to the president that the executives of those failed banks were held accountable and, very important, that taxpayer money not be at risk,” she continued. Before its collapse last month, Silicon Valley Bank was known to investors of color as a place that fostered a community of minority entrepreneurs and provided them with both social and financial capital. SVB regularly sponsored conferences and networking events for minority entrepreneurs, and it was well known for funding the annual State of Black Venture Report spearheaded by BLK VC, a nonprofit organization that connects and empowers Black investors. “When other banks were saying no, SVB would say yes,” said Joynicole Martinez, a 25-year entrepreneur and chief advancement and innovation officer for Rising Tide Capital, a nonprofit organization founded in 2004 to connect entrepreneurs with investors and mentors. Minority business owners have long faced challenges accessing capital due to discriminatory lending practices, experts say. Data from the Small Business Credit Survey, a collaboration of all 12 Federal Reserve banks, shows disparities on denial rates for bank and nonbank loans. In 2021, about 16% of Black-led companies acquired the total amount of business financing they sought from banks, compared to 35% of White-owned companies, the survey shows. “We know there’s historic, systemic, and just blatant racism that’s inherent in lending and banking. We have to start there and not tip-toe around it,” Martinez told CNN. The Financial Services Forum, an organization representing the eight largest financial institutions in the United States has said banks have committed millions of dollars since 2020 to address economic and racial inequality.

Here's what you need to know,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/13/success/tax-filing-tips/index.html,2023-04-14 20:07:40.000,"Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks So far this tax season, the IRS has received more than 100 million income tax returns for 2022. That means tens of millions of households have yet to file their returns. If yours is among them, here are some last-minute tax-filing tips to keep in mind as the Tuesday, April 18 deadline approaches. Not everyone has to file on April 18: If you live in a federally declared disaster area, have a business there — or have relevant tax documents stored by businesses in that area — it’s likely the IRS has already extended the filing and payment deadlines for you. Here is where you can find the specific extension dates for each disaster area. Thanks to many rounds of extreme weather in recent months, for instance, tax filers in most of California — which accounts for 10% to 15% of all federal filers — have already been granted an extension until Oct. 16 to file and to pay, according to an IRS spokesperson. If you’re in the armed forces and are currently or were recently stationed in a combat zone, the filing and payment deadlines for your 2022 taxes are most likely extended by 180 days. But your specific extended filing and payment deadlines will depend on the day you leave (or left) the combat zone. This IRS publication offers more detail. Taxes and adulting: What to know about filing taxes on your own for the first time Lastly, if you made little to no money last year (typically less than $12,950 for single filers and $25,900 for married couples), you may not be required to file a return. But you may want to anyway if you think you are eligible for a refund thanks to, for instance, refundable tax credits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit. (Use this IRS tool to gauge whether you are required to file this year.) You also are likely eligible to use IRS Free File (intended for those with adjusted gross income of $73,000 or less) so it won’t cost you to submit a return. Your paycheck may not be your only source of income: If you had one full-time job you may think that is the only income you made and have to report. But that’s not necessarily so. Other potentially taxable and reportable income sources include: Organize your tax documents: By now you should have received every tax document that third parties are required to send you (your employer, bank, brokerage, etc.). If you don’t recall receiving a hard copy of a tax form in the mail, check your email and your online accounts — a document may have been sent to you electronically. Here are some of the tax forms you may have received: “Be aware that there’s no form for some taxable income, like proceeds from renting out your vacation property, meaning you’re responsible for reporting it on your own,” according to the Illinois CPA Society. One very last-minute way to reduce your 2022 tax bill: If you’re eligible to make a tax-deductible contribution to an IRA and haven’t done so for last year, you have until April 18 to contribute up to $6,000 ($7,000 if you’re 50 or older). That will reduce your tax bill and augment your retirement savings. Proofread your return before submitting it: Do this whether you’re using tax software or working with a professional tax preparer. Little mistakes and oversights delay the processing of your return (and the issuance of your refund if you’re owed one). You want to avoid things like having a typo in your name, birth date, Social Security number or direct deposit number; choosing the wrong filing status (e.g., married vs single); making a simple math error; or leaving a required field blank. What to do if you can’t file by April 18: If you’re not able to file by next Tuesday, fill out Form 4868 electronically or on paper and send it in by April 18. You will be granted an automatic six-month extension to file. Your tax refund may be smaller this year. Here's why Note, however, that an extension to file is not an extension to pay. You will be charged interest (currently running at 7%) and a penalty on any amount you still owe for 2022 but haven’t paid by April 18. So if you suspect you still owe tax — perhaps you had some income outside of your job for which tax wasn’t withheld or you had a big capital gain last year — approximate how much more you owe and send that money to the IRS by Tuesday. You can choose to do so by mail, attaching a check to your extension request form. Make sure your envelope is postmarked no later than April 18. Or the more efficient route is pay what you owe electronically at IRS.gov, said CPA Damien Martin, a tax partner at EY. If you do that, the IRS notes you will not have to file a Form 4868. “The IRS will automatically process an extension of time to file,” the agency notes in its instructions. If you opt to electronically pay directly from your bank account, which is free, select “extension” and then “tax year 2022” when given the option. You can also pay by credit or debit card, but you will be charged a processing fee. Doing so, though, may become much more costly than just a fee if you charge your tax payment but don’t pay your credit card bill off in full every month, since you likely pay a high interest rate on outstanding balances. If you still owe income taxes to your state, remember that you may need to go through a similar exercise of filing for an extension and making a payment to your state’s revenue department, Martin said.

1,2024-08-05 07:36:42.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-05 04:51:06.000,Retail spending fell in March as consumers pull back,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/14/economy/march-retail-sales/index.html,2023-04-14 14:29:52.000,"Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Spending at US retailers fell in March as consumers pulled back after the banking crisis fueled recession fears. Retail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation, fell by 1% in March from the prior month, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. That was steeper than an expected 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv, and above the revised 0.2% decline in the prior month. Investors chalk up some of the weakness to a lack of tax returns and concerns about a slowing labor market. The IRS issued $84 billion in tax refunds this March, about $25 billion less than they issued in March of 2022, according to BofA analysts. That led consumers to pull back in spending at department stores and on durable goods, such as appliances and furniture. Spending at general merchandise stores fell 3% in March from the prior month and spending at gas stations declined 5.5% during the same period. Excluding gas station sales, retail spending retreated 0.6% in March from February. However, retail spending rose 2.9% year-over-year. Smaller tax returns likely played a role in last month’s decline in retail sales, along with the expiration of enhanced food assistance benefits, economists say. “March is a really important month for refunds. Some folks might have been expecting something similar to last year,” Aditya Bhave, senior US economist at BofA Global Research, told CNN. Credit and debit card spending per household tracked by Bank of America researchers moderated in March to its slowest pace in more than two years, which was likely the result of smaller returns and expired benefits, coupled with slowing wage growth. Enhanced pandemic-era benefits provided through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program expired in February, which might have also held back spending in March, according to a Bank of America Institute report. Average hourly earnings grew 4.2% in March from a year earlier, down from the prior month’s annualized 4.6% increase and the smallest annual rise since June 2021, according to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Employment Cost Index, a more comprehensive measure of wages, has also shown that worker pay gains have moderated this past year. ECI data for the first quarter of this year will be released later this month. Still, the US labor market remains solid, even though it has lost momentum recently. That could hold up consumer spending in the coming months, said Michelle Meyer, North America chief economist at Mastercard Economics Institute. “The big picture is still favorable for the consumer when you think about their income growth, their balance sheet and the health of the labor market,” Meyer said. Employers added 236,000 jobs in March, a robust gain by historical standards but smaller than the average monthly pace of job growth in the prior six months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The latest monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, showed that the number of available jobs remained elevated in February — but was down more than 17% from its peak of 12 million in March 2022, and revised data showed that weekly claims for US unemployment benefits were higher than previously reported. The job market could cool further in the coming months. Economists at the Federal Reserve expect the US economy to head into a recession later in the year as the lagged effects of higher interest rates take a deeper hold. Fed economists had forecast subdued growth, with risks of a recession, prior to the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. For consumers, the effects of last month’s turbulence in the banking industry have been limited so far. Consumer sentiment tracked by the University of Michigan worsened slightly in March during the bank failures, but it had already shown signs of deteriorating before then. The latest consumer sentiment reading, released Friday morning, showed that sentiment held steady in April despite the banking crisis, but that higher gas prices helped push up year-ahead inflation expectations by a full percentage point, rising from 3.6% in March to 4.6% in April. “On net, consumers did not perceive material changes in the economic environment in April,” Joanne Hsu, director of the surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan, said in a news release. “Consumers are expecting a downturn, they’re not feeling as dismal as they were last summer, but they’re waiting for the other shoe to drop,” Hsu told Bloomberg TV in an interview Friday morning.

1,2024-08-05 07:36:42.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-05 04:51:06.000,Analysis: Fox News is about to enter the true No Spin Zone,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/14/media/fox-news-dominion-hnk-intl/index.html,2023-04-14 06:41:00.000,"Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks This is it. The media defamation trial of the century is on the precipice of kicking off in Wilmington, Delaware, in just days. Jury selection in Dominion Voting Systems’ monster $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit took place all of Thursday, with 300 potential jurors being summoned to court. Good progress was made and the presiding judge noted that there were “more than enough jurors” to start the trial as scheduled on Monday. It is there, in Courtroom 7E, where the biggest figures in Murdoch Media, accompanied by a throng of high-powered lawyers, will attempt to mount their defense after repeatedly failing to convince a judge to toss the now-historic case. A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. It’s, frankly, extraordinary to write those words. When I watched Fox News broadcast election lies in the aftermath of the 2020 election, never did I expect the network to be held accountable in a meaningful way. I’ve covered Fox News for a while now. I’ve watched thousands and thousands of hours of the right-wing channel’s programming. I’ve seen its hosts over the years undermine public health, make gross anti-immigrant remarks, peddle lies and propaganda and push deranged conspiracy theories that were once reserved for the right-wing’s furthest fringes. The network has always seemed to find a way to sail through the controversy, even the most hellish storms it has faced. Sometimes it has emerged even stronger and more emboldened than before. But this time is different. This time, the normal tricks the network turns to during times of crisis will not free it from trouble. This time, in a court of law, the network will need to put forward an honest, fact-driven argument. Fox News is about to enter the true No Spin Zone, where deception is strictly prohibited. Where it is not in charge. And where its top executives like Rupert Murdoch and Suzanne Scott and hosts like Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity cannot simply ignore a request for comment and resort to, instead, attacking “the media” on-air. In this setting, where lies cannot be casually told and truth cannot be distorted beyond reality to fit a dishonest narrative, it will be fascinating to see how the network fares. If the pre-trial hearings are any indicator, it won’t be pretty. The case hasn’t even started and the presiding judge has already lost his patience with Fox’s legal team and put them on notice. Perhaps the winds will shift for Fox News when the judge gavels in the trial on Monday. But if they play out like the last few weeks of court have, Fox News is in for a brutal ride.

1,2024-08-05 07:36:42.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-05 04:51:06.000,Silicon Valley Bank collapse renews calls to address disparities impacting entrepreneurs of color ,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/13/business/silicon-valley-bank-entrepreneurs-of-color-reaj/index.html,2023-04-13 21:13:04.000,"Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks When customers at Silicon Valley Bank rushed to withdraw billions of dollars last month, venture capitalist Arlan Hamilton stepped in to help some of the founders of color who panicked about losing access to payroll funds. As a Black woman with nearly 10 years of business experience, Hamilton knew the options for those startup founders were limited. SVB had a reputation for servicing people from underrepresented communities like hers. Its failure has reignited concerns from industry experts about lending discrimination in the banking industry and the resulting disparities in capital for people of color. Hamilton, the 43-year-old founder and managing partner of Backstage Capital, said that when it comes to entrepreneurs of color, “we’re already in the smaller house. We already have the rickety door and the thinner walls. And so, when a tornado comes by, we’re going to get hit harder.” Established in 1983, the midsize California tech lender was America’s 16th largest bank at the end of 2022 before it collapsed on March 10. SVB provided banking services to nearly half of all venture-backed technology and life-sciences companies in the United States. Hamilton, industry experts and other investors told CNN the bank was committed to fostering a community of minority entrepreneurs and provided them with both social and financial capital. SVB regularly sponsored conferences and networking events for minority entrepreneurs, said Hamilton, and it was well known for funding the annual State of Black Venture Report spearheaded by BLK VC, a nonprofit organization that connects and empowers Black investors. “When other banks were saying no, SVB would say yes,” said Joynicole Martinez, a 25-year entrepreneur and chief advancement and innovation officer for Rising Tide Capital, a nonprofit organization founded in 2004 to connect entrepreneurs with investors and mentors. Martinez is also an official member of the Forbes Coaches Council, an invitation-only organization for business and career coaches. She said SVB was an invaluable resource for entrepreneurs of color and offered their clients discounted tech tools and research funding. Minority business owners have long faced challenges accessing capital due to discriminatory lending practices, experts say. Data from the Small Business Credit Survey, a collaboration of all 12 Federal Reserve banks, shows disparities on denial rates for bank and nonbank loans. In 2021, about 16% of Black-led companies acquired the total amount of business financing they sought from banks, compared to 35% of White-owned companies, the survey shows. “We know there’s historic, systemic, and just blatant racism that’s inherent in lending and banking. We have to start there and not tip-toe around it,” Martinez told CNN. Asya Bradley is an immigrant founder of multiple tech companies like Kinley, a financial services business aiming to help Black Americans build generational wealth. Following SVB’s collapse, Bradley said she joined a WhatsApp group of more than 1,000 immigrant business founders. Members of the group quickly mobilized to support one another, she said. Immigrant founders often don’t have Social Security numbers nor permanent addresses in the United States, Bradley said, and it was crucial to brainstorm different ways to find funding in a system that doesn’t recognize them. “The community was really special because a lot of these folks then were sharing different things that they had done to achieve success in terms of getting accounts in different places. They also were able to share different regional banks that have stood up and been like, ‘Hey, if you have accounts at SVB, we can help you guys,’” Bradley said. Many women, people of color and immigrants opt for community or regional banks like SVB, Bradley says, because they are often rejected from the “top four banks” — JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citibank. In her case, Bradley said her gender might have been an issue when she could only open a business account at one of the “top four banks” when her brother co-signed for her. “The top four don’t want our business. The top four are rejecting us consistently. The top four do not give us the service that we deserve. And that’s why we’ve gone to community banks and regional banks such as SVB,” Bradley said. None of the top four banks provided a comment to CNN. The Financial Services Forum, an organization representing the eight largest financial institutions in the United States has said the banks have committed millions of dollars since 2020 to address economic and racial inequality. Last week, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told CNN’s Poppy Harlow that his bank has 30% of its branches in lower-income neighborhoods as part of a $30 billion commitment to Black and Brown communities across the country. Wells Fargo specifically pointed to its 2022 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion report, which discusses the bank’s recent initiatives to reach underserved communities. The bank partnered last year with the Black Economic Alliance to initiate the Black Entrepreneur Fund — a $50 million seed, startup, and early-stage capital fund for businesses founded or led by Black and African American entrepreneurs. And since May 2021, Wells Fargo has invested in 13 Minority Depository Institutions, fulfilling its $50 million pledge to support Black-owned banks. Black-owned banks work to close the lending gap and foster economic empowerment in these traditionally excluded communities, but their numbers have been dwindling over the years, and they have far fewer assets at their disposal than the top banks. OneUnited Bank, the largest Black-owned bank in the United States, manages a little over $650 million in assets. By comparison, JPMorgan Chase manages $3.7 trillion in assets. Because of these disparities, entrepreneurs also seek funding from venture capitalists. In the early 2010s, Hamilton intended to start her own tech company — but as she searched for investors, she saw that White men control nearly all venture capital dollars. That experience led her to establish Backstage Capital, a venture capital fund that invests in new companies led by underrepresented founders. “I said, ‘Well, instead of trying to raise money for one company, let me try to raise for a venture fund that will invest in underrepresented — and now we call them underestimated — founders who are women, people of color, and LGBTQ specifically,’ because I am all three,” Hamilton told CNN. Since then, Backstage Capital has amassed a portfolio of nearly 150 different companies and has made over 120 diversity investments, according to data from Crunchbase. But Bradley, who is also an ‘angel investor’ of minority-owned businesses, said she remains “really hopeful” that community banks, regional banks and fintechs “will all stand up and say, ‘Hey, we are not going to let the good work of SVB go to waste.’” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

In addition to water loss due to an intense multiyear drought, the US Geological Survey and the Bureau of Reclamation report found, Lake Powell faced an average annual loss in storage capacity of about 33,270 acre-feet, or 11 billion gallons, per year between 1963 and 2018. That’s enough water to fill the Reflecting Pool on the National Mall about 1,600 times. The capacity of the reservoir is shrinking because of sediments flowing in from the Colorado and San Juan rivers, according to the report. Those sediments settle at the bottom of the reservoir and decrease the total amount of water the reservoir can hold. As of Monday, Lake Powell was around 25% full, according to data from the Bureau of Reclamation. It’s bad news for a region already facing water shortages and extreme wildfires due to the drought. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration drought experts said last week these conditions are expected to at least continue – if not worsen – in the coming months. Lake Powell is an important reservoir in the Colorado River Basin. Both Lake Powell and nearby Lake Mead, the nation’s largest reservoir, have drained at an alarming rate. In August, the federal government declared a water shortage on the Colorado River for the first time after Lake Mead’s water level plunged to unprecedented lows, triggering mandatory water consumption cuts for states in the Southwest that began in January. And last week, Lake Powell dipped below the critical threshold of 3,525 feet above sea level, sparking additional concerns about water supply and hydropower generation millions of people in the West rely on for electricity. The significance of the dwindling water supply along the Colorado cannot be overstated. The system supplies water for more than 40 million people living across seven Western states and Mexico. Lakes Powell and Mead provide a critical supply of drinking water and irrigation for many across the region, including rural farms, ranches and native communities. “It is vitally important we have the best-available scientific information like this report to provide a clear understanding of water availability in Lake Powell as we plan for the future,” Tanya Trujillo, assistant secretary for water and science with the US Department of Interior, said in a statement. “The Colorado River system faces multiple challenges, including the effects of a 22-year-long drought and the increased impacts of climate change.” © 2024 Cable News Network.

The report by IQAir, a company that tracks global air quality, found that average annual air pollution in every country — and 97% of cities — exceeded the World Health Organization’s air quality guidelines, which were designed to help governments craft regulations to protect public health. Related article Not only is Lake Powell's water level plummeting because of drought, its total capacity is shrinking, too Only 222 cities of the 6,475 analyzed had average air quality that met WHO’s standard. Three territories were found to have met WHO guidelines: the French territory of New Caledonia and the United States territories of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. India, Pakistan and Bangladesh were among the countries with the worst air pollution, exceeding the guidelines by at least 10 times. The Scandinavian countries, Australia, Canada, Japan and United Kingdom ranked among the best countries for air quality, with average levels that exceeded the guidelines by 1 to 2 times. In the United States, IQAir found air pollution exceeded WHO guidelines by 2 to 3 times in 2021. “This report underscores the need for governments around the world to help reduce global air pollution,” Glory Dolphin Hammes, CEO of IQAir North America, told CNN. “(Fine particulate matter) kills far too many people every year and governments need to set more stringent air quality national standards and explore better foreign policies that promote better air quality.” Above: IQAir analyzed average annual air quality for more than 6,000 cities and categorized them from best air quality, in blue (Meets WHO PM2.5 guildline) to worst, in purple (Exceeds WHO PM2.5 guideline by over 10 times). An interactive map is available from IQAir. It’s the first major global air quality report based on WHO’s new annual air pollution guidelines, which were updated in September 2021. The new guidelines halved the acceptable concentration of fine particulate matter — or PM 2.5 — from 10 down to 5 micrograms per cubic meter. PM 2.5 is the tiniest pollutant yet also among the most dangerous. When inhaled, it travels deep into lung tissue where it can enter the bloodstream. It comes from sources like the burning of fossil fuels, dust storms and wildfires, and has been linked to a number of health threats including asthma, heart disease and other respiratory illnesses. Related article Allergy season will start much earlier than normal and be far more intense because of climate crisis, study suggests Millions of people die each year from air quality issues. In 2016, around 4.2 million premature deaths were associated with fine particulate matter, according to WHO. If the 2021 guidelines had been applied that year, WHO found there could have been nearly 3.3 million fewer pollution-related deaths. IQAir analyzed pollution-monitoring stations in 6,475 cities across 117 countries, regions and territories. In the US, air pollution spiked in 2021 compared to 2020. Out of the more than 2,400 US cities analyzed, Los Angeles air remained the most polluted, despite seeing a 6% decrease compared to 2020. Atlanta and Minneapolis saw significant increases in pollution, the report showed. “The (United States’) reliance on fossil fuels, increasing severity of wildfires as well as varying enforcement of the Clean Air Act from administration to administration have all added to U.S. air pollution,” the authors wrote. Researchers say the main sources of pollution in the US were fossil fuel-powered transportation, energy production and wildfires, which wreak havoc on the country’s most vulnerable and marginalized communities. “We are heavily dependent on fossil fuels, especially in terms of transportation,” said Hammes, who lives a few miles from Los Angeles. “We can act smartly on this with zero emissions, but we’re still not doing it. And this is having a devastating impact on the air pollution that we’re seeing in major cities.” Related article Big-box stores could help slash emissions and save millions by putting solar panels on roofs. Why aren't more of them doing it? Climate change-fueled wildfires played a significant role in reducing air quality in the US in 2021. The authors pointed to a number of fires that led to hazardous air pollution — including the Caldor and Dixie fires in California, as well as the Bootleg Fire in Oregon, which wafted smoke all the way to the East Coast in July. China — which is among the countries with the worst air pollution — showed improved air quality in 2021. More than half of the Chinese cities analyzed in the report saw lower levels of air pollution compared to the previous year. The capital city of Beijing continued a five-year trend of improved air quality, according to the report, due to a policy-driven drawdown of polluting industries in the city. The report also found that the Amazon Rainforest, which had acted as the world’s major defender against the climate crisis, emitted more carbon dioxide than it absorbed last year. Deforestation and wildfires have threatened the critical ecosystem, polluted the air and contributed to climate change. “This is all a part of the formula that will lead to or is leading to global warming.” Hammes said. The report also unveiled some inequalities: Monitoring stations remain scant in some developing countries in Africa, South America and the Middle East, resulting in a dearth of air quality data in those regions. “When you don’t have that data, you’re really in the dark,” Hammes said.

It depends where in the world you look Hammes noted the African country of Chad was included in the report for the first time, due to an improvement in its monitoring network. IQAir found the country’s air pollution was the second-highest in the world last year, behind Bangladesh. Tarik Benmarhnia, a climate change epidemiologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography who has studied the health impact of wildfire smoke, also noted that relying only on monitoring stations can lead to blind spots in these reports. “I think it is great that they relied on different networks and not only governmental sources,” Benmarhnia, who was not involved in this report, told CNN. “However, many regions do not have enough stations and alternative techniques exist.” The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded in its 2021 report that, in addition to slowing the speed of global warming, curbing the use of fossil fuels would have the added benefit of improving air quality and public health. Hammes said the IQAir report is even more reason for the world to wean off fossil fuel. “We’ve got the report, we can read it, we can internalize it and really devote ourselves to taking action,” she said. “There needs to be a major move towards renewable energy. We need to take drastic action in order to reverse the tide of global warming; otherwise, the impact and the train that we’re on (would be) irreversible.” © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

1,2024-08-05 07:36:42.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-05 04:51:06.000,Big-box stores could help slash emissions and save millions by putting solar panels on roofs. Why aren't more of them doing it?,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/20/us/solar-power-on-big-box-store-rooftops-climate/index.html,2022-03-20 07:01:50.000,"As the US attempts to wean itself off its heavy reliance on fossil fuels and shift to cleaner energy sources, many experts are eyeing a promising solution: your neighborhood big-box stores and shopping malls. The rooftops and parking lot space available at retail giants like Walmart, Target and Costco is massive. And these largely empty spaces are being touted as untapped potential for solar power that could help the US reduce its dependency on foreign energy, slash planet-warming emissions and save companies millions of dollars in the process. At the IKEA store in Baltimore, installing solar panels on the roof and over the store’s parking lot cut the amount of energy it needed to purchase by 84%, slashing its costs by 57% from September to December of 2020, according to the company. (The panels also provide some beneficial shade to keep customers’ cars cool on hot, sunny days.) Related article Could Russia's war kick-start a renewable-energy revolution? It depends where in the world you look As of February 2021, IKEA had 54 solar arrays installed across 90% of its US locations. Big-box stores and shopping centers have enough roof space to produce half of their annual electricity needs from solar, according to a report from nonprofit Environment America and research firm Frontier Group. Leveraging the full rooftop solar potential of these superstores would generate enough electricity to power nearly 8 million average homes, the report concluded, and would cut the same amount of planet-warming emissions as pulling 11.3 million gas-powered cars off the road. The average Walmart store, for example, has 180,000 square feet of rooftop, according to the report. That’s roughly the size of three football fields and enough space to support solar energy that could power the equivalent of 200 homes, the report said. “Every rooftop in America that isn’t producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them,” Johanna Neumann, senior director for Environment America’s campaign for 100% Renewable, told CNN. “Now is the time to lean into local renewable energy production, and there’s no better place than the roofs of America’s big-box superstores.” Advocates involved in clean energy worker-training programs tell CNN that a solar revolution in big-box retail would also be a significant windfall for local communities, spurring economic growth while tackling the climate crisis, which has inflicted disproportionate harm on marginalized communities. Yet only a fraction of big-box stores in the US have solar on their rooftops or solar canopies in parking lots, the report’s authors told CNN. Related article Why record-high gas prices won't be solved by drilling more oil in the US CNN reached out to five of the top US retailers — Walmart, Kroger, Home Depot, Costco and Target — to ask: Why not invest in more rooftop solar? Many renewable energy experts point to solar as a relatively simple solution to cut down on costs and help rein in fossil fuel emissions, but the companies point to several roadblocks — regulations, labor costs and structural integrity of the rooftops themselves — that are preventing more widespread adoption. The need for these kinds of clean energy initiatives is becoming “unquestionably urgent” as the climate crisis accelerates, said Edwin Cowen, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Cornell University. “We are behind the eight ball, to put it mildly,” Cowen told CNN. “I would have loved to see policy help incentivize rooftop solar 15 years ago instead of five years ago in the commercial space. There’s still a tremendous amount of work to do.” Neumann said Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, possesses by far the largest solar potential. Walmart has around 5,000 stores in the US and more than 783 million square feet of rooftop space — an area larger than Manhattan — and more than 8,974 gigawatt hours of annual rooftop solar potential, according to the report. It’s enough electricity to power more than 842,000 homes, the report said. “Every rooftop in America that isn’t producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them.” Johanna Neumann, Environment America Walmart spokesperson Mariel Messier told CNN the company is involved in renewable energy projects around the world, but many of them are not rooftop solar installations. The company has reported having completed on- and off-site wind and solar projects or had others under development with a capacity to produce more than 2.3 gigawatts of renewable energy. Neumann said Environment America has met with Walmart a few times, urging the retailer to commit to installing solar panels on roofs and in parking lots. The company has said it’s aiming to source 100% of its energy through renewable projects by 2035. “Of all the retailers in America, Walmart stands to make the biggest impact if they put rooftop solar on all of their stores,” Neumann told CNN. “And for us, this report just underscores just how much of an impact they could make if they make that decision.” According to Environment America, Walmart had installed almost 194 megawatts of solar capacity on its US facilities as of the end of the 2021 fiscal year and additional capacity in off-site solar farms. The company’s installations in California were expected to provide between 20% to 30% of each location’s electricity needs. Target ranked No. 1 for on-site solar capacity in 2019, according to industry trade group Solar Energy Industries Association’s most recent report. It currently has 542 locations with rooftop solar — around a quarter of the company’s stores — a Target spokesperson told CNN. Rooftop solar generates enough energy to meet 15% to 40% of Target properties’ energy needs, the spokesperson said. Richard Galanti, the chief financial officer at Costco, said the company has 121 stores with rooftop solar around the world, 95 of which are in the US. Walmart, Target and Costco did not share with CNN what their biggest barriers are to adding rooftop or parking lot solar panels to more stores.  “My suspicion is that they want an even stronger business case for deviating from business-as-usual,” Neumann said. “Historically, all those roofs have done is cover their stores, and rethinking how [they] use their buildings and thinking of them as energy generators, not just protection from rain, requires a small change in their business model.” Home Depot, which has around 2,300 stores, currently has 75 completed rooftop solar projects, 12 in construction and more than 30 planned for future development, said Craig D’Arcy, the company’s director of energy management. Solar power generates around half of these stores’ energy needs on average, he said. Aging rooftops at stores are a “huge impediment” to solar installation, D’Arcy added. If a roof needs to be replaced in the next 15 to 20 years or sooner, it doesn’t make financial sense for Home Depot to add solar systems today, he said. “We have a goal of implementing solar rooftop where the economics are attractive,” D’Arcy told CNN. CNN also reached out to Kroger, which owns about 2,800 stores across the US. Kristal Howard, a Kroger spokesperson, said the company currently has 15 properties — stores, distribution centers and manufacturing plants — with solar installations. One of the “multiple factors affecting the viability of a solar installation” was the stores’ ability to support a solar installation on the roofs, Howard said. Cowen, the engineering professor at Cornell, said solar is already attractive, but that labor costs, incentives and the different layers of regulation likely pose some financial challenges in solar installations. “For them, this means usually hiring a local site firm that can do that installation that also knows local policy,” Cowen said. “It’s just another layer of complexity that I think is beginning to make sense because the costs have come down enough, but it needs kind of reopening that door of getting into an existing building.” Related article 'Delay means death': We're running out of ways to adapt to the climate crisis, new report shows. Here are the key takeaways Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois, who co-chairs the power sector task force in the House, said the US has “failed to provide the incentives to people who have the expertise to go in and build these things.” The reason both retail companies and the power sector have not made much progress on solar is because “our system is so disjointed” and has a complex regulation structure, Casten said. “Why aren’t we doing something that makes economic sense? The answer is this horribly disjointed federal policy where we massively subsidize fossil energy extraction, and we penalize clean energy production,” Casten told CNN. “For a long, long time, if you wanted to build a solar panel on the rooftop of Walmart, your biggest enemy was going to be your local utility because they didn’t want to lose the load. “We could have done this decades ago,” Casten added. “And had we done it, we would not be in this dire position with the climate, but we’d also have a lot more money in our pocket.” For Charles Callaway, director of organizing at the nonprofit group WE ACT for Environmental Justice, strengthening the rooftop solar capacity in big box retail stores is a no-brainer, especially if companies allow the local community to reap benefits either through installation jobs or sharing the electricity produced later. Either way, it would put a massive dent in curbing the climate crisis and help usher in an equitable transition away from fossil fuels — and it’s doable, Callaway told CNN. The New York City resident led a worker training program that helped train more than 100 local community members, mostly people of color, to become solar installers. He also formed a solar workers cooperative to ensure many of the participants of the training program get jobs in a tough market. In the last two years, Callaway said his group has not only installed solar panels on roofs of affordable housing units, but also equipment capable of producing 2 megawatts of solar energy on shopping malls up in upstate New York. He emphasized that hiring locally would be most beneficial since local installers know the community and local regulations best. Related article Allergy season will start much earlier than normal and be far more intense because of climate crisis, study suggests “One of my huge concerns is social equity,” Cowen said. “Access to renewable energy is a fairly privileged position these days, and we’ve got to figure out ways to make that not true.” Jasmine Graham, WE ACT’s energy justice policy manager, said the potential of building rooftop solar on big box superstores is encouraging, only “if these projects use local labor, if they are paying prevailing wages, and if this solar is being used in a manner such as community solar, which would allow [utility] bill discounts for folks that live in the same utility zone.” Pressure is mounting for global leaders to act urgently on the climate crisis after a UN report in late February warned the window for action is rapidly closing. Neumann believes the US can meet its energy demand with renewables. All it takes, she said, is the political will to make that switch, and the inclusion of the local community so no one gets left behind in the transition. “The sooner we make that transition, the sooner we’ll have cleaner air, the sooner we’ll have a more protected environment and better health and the sooner we’ll have a more livable future for our kids,” Neumann said. “And even if that requires investment, it is an investment worth making.” CNN’s Judson Jones contributed to this report. © 2024 Cable News Network.

1,2024-08-05 07:36:42.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-05 04:51:06.000,Look of the Week: Blackpink headline Coachella in Korean hanboks,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/blackpink-coachella-2023-hanboks-lotw/index.html,2023-04-18 15:39:40.000,"Editor’s Note: Featuring the good, the bad and the ugly, ‘Look of the Week’ is a regular series dedicated to unpacking the most talked about outfit of the last seven days. Bringing the second day of this year’s Coachella to a close, K-Pop girl group Blackpink made history Saturday night when they became the first Asian act to ever headline the festival. To a crowd of, reportedly, over 125,000 people, Jennie, Jisoo, Lisa and Rosé used the ground-breaking moment to pay homage to Korean heritage by arriving onstage in hanboks: a traditional type of dress. While the garments were shrugged off a few seconds into their opening track, “Pink Venom,” revealing each member’s custom black and pink Dolce and Gabbana outfit, fans across the world had already received the message. Screenshots of the moment quickly spread among Blackpink superfans, otherwise known as Blinks. “The way they stepped onto the biggest western stage in hanboks … literally proved their place at the top of the industry,” tweeted one Blink. “Blackpink really are in a league of their own.” Another called the group “Korea’s cultural delegation” on Instagram, in reference to not only the hanboks but other visual cues incorporated into their show, such as one of the stage backdrops featuring an angular tiled roof reminiscent of traditional Korean architecture. Look of the Week: Are we about to see more men in tights? In recent years, Blackpink have enjoyed a meteoric rise to global fame. According to Guinness World Records, they are currently the most streamed female group on Spotify, and have the most-viewed music YouTube channel. Last year, they were the first female K-Pop group to reach number 1 in the UK and US album charts, and in 2020 their track “How You Like That” became the most viewed video on YouTube in 24 hours. (The group also wore modernized hanboks, designed by Kim Danha, in one of the music video’s scenes.) Their landmark set over the weekend was in fact a follow-up to another milestone: In 2019, they became the first female K-Pop group to ever play at Coachella or any other US festival. From the iconic Jean Paul Gaultier cone bra worn by Madonna for her 1990 Blond Ambition tour to Geri “Ginger Spice” Halliwell’s Union Jack mini dress, the right stage costume can live on forever in public memory. Particularly when worn at a career-defining moment. During another watershed Coachella performance — Beyonce’s 2018 headline set — the singer’s custom Balmain collegiate-style yellow hoodie was a joyful nod to Black culture, specifically historically Black colleagues and universities. The group’s four black hanboks were custom created by South Korean pattern design brand OUWR and traditional Korean dressmakers Kumdanje. Inspired by the Cheol-lik silhouette, each garment was hand-embroidered with metallic traditional Korean motifs, including dan-cheong patterns and peonies (a symbol of royalty in Korea). “It was our pleasure and such an honor to be able to show the beautiful values of Korea and Hanbok together,” the designers wrote in a combined Instagram post. “Blackpink showed the beauty of Korea and dazzled the world.” In Korea, hanboks are still worn for special occasions and often seen on TV dramas. Many designers in the country have also created contemporary takes that are incorporated into everyday wear. At Seoul Fashion Week, JULYCOLUMN’s Fall-Winter 2023 collection drew on the hanbok’s voluminous silhouette to create shirts and structured jackets. Last September, Korean label BlueTamburin brought the garment to a Western audience by exclusively using traditional hanbok fabric to create its Spring-Summer 2023 collection at Milan Fashion Week. Look of the Week: 'Barbie' stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling hit the road in bubblegum pink Whether you’re a devoted Blink or not, the looks marked a moment of Asian visibility, recognition of traditional craftsmanship and a powerful example of feeling seen through fashion — representing Korean culture and symbolically embracing both its past and future. At the end of their performance, and having addressed the audience between numbers in English throughout their two-hour-long performance, Blackpink finished their set in Korean: “Until now, it has been Jennie, Jisoo, Lisa, and Rosé Blackpink. Thank you.” Top image: Blackpink performing at the first weekend of Coachella 2023, shortly after removing their hanboks. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

1,2024-08-05 07:36:42.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-05 04:51:06.000,Scientists identify secret ingredient in Leonardo da Vinci paintings,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/old-masters-da-vinci-egg-yolk-painting-scn/index.html,2023-03-30 17:43:18.000,"Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. “Old Masters” such as Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli and Rembrandt may have used proteins, especially egg yolk, in their oil paintings, according to a new study. Trace quantities of protein residue have long been detected in classic oil paintings, though they were often ascribed to contamination. A new study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications found the inclusion was likely intentional — and sheds light on the technical knowledge of the Old Masters, the most skilled European painters of the 16th, 17th, or early 18th century, and the way they prepared their paints. Scientists confirm long held theory about what inspired Monet “There are very few written sources about this and no scientific work has been done before to investigate the subject in such depth,” said study author Ophélie Ranquet of the Institute of Mechanical Process Engineering and Mechanics at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany, in a phone interview. “Our results show that even with a very small amount of egg yolk, you can achieve an amazing change of properties in the oil paint, demonstrating how it might have been beneficial for the artists.” Simply adding some egg yolk to their works, it turns out, could have long-lasting effects that went beyond just aesthetics. Compared with the medium formulated by ancient Egyptians called tempera — which combines egg yolk with powdered pigments and water — oil paint creates more intense colors, allows for very smooth color transitions and dries far less quickly, so it can be used for several days after its preparation. However, oil paint, which uses linseed or safflower oil instead of water, also has drawbacks, including being more susceptible to color darkening and damage caused by exposure to light. Because making paint was an artisanal and experimental process, it is possible that the Old Masters might have added egg yolk, a familiar ingredient, to the newer type of paint, which first showed up in the seventh century in Central Asia before spreading to Northern Europe in the Middle Ages and Italy during the Renaissance. In the study, the researchers recreated the process of paint-making by using four ingredients — egg yolk, distilled water, linseed oil and pigment — to mix two historically popular and significant colors, lead white and ultramarine blue. “The addition of egg yolk is beneficial because it can tune the properties of these paints in a drastic way,” Ranquet said, “For example by showing aging differently: It takes a longer time for the paint to oxidize, because of the antioxidants contained in the yolk.” The chemical reactions between the oil, the pigment and the proteins in the yolk directly affect the paint’s behavior and viscosity. “For example, the lead white pigment is quite sensitive to humidity, but if you coat it with a protein layer, it makes it a lot more resistant to it, making the paint quite easy to apply,” Ranquet said. “On the other hand, if you wanted something stiffer without having to add a lot of pigment, with a bit of egg yolk you can create a high impasto paint,” she added, referring to a painting technique where the paint is laid out in a stroke thick enough that the brushstrokes are still visible. Using less pigment would have been desirable centuries ago, when certain pigments — such as lapis lazuli, which was used to make ultramarine blue — were more expensive than gold, according to Ranquet. A direct evidence of the effect of egg yolk in oil paint, or lack thereof, can be seen in Leonardo da Vinci’s “Madonna of the Carnation,” one of the paintings observed during the study. Currently on display at the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, Germany, the work shows evident wrinkling on the face of Mary and the child. “Oil paint starts to dry from the surface down, which is why it wrinkles,” Ranquet said. One reason for wrinkling may be an insufficient quantity of pigments in the paint, and the study has shown that this effect could be avoided with the addition of egg yolk: “That’s quite amazing because you have the same quantity of pigment in your paint, but the presence of the egg yolk changes everything.” Because wrinkling occurs within days, it’s likely that Leonardo and other Old Masters might have caught onto this particular effect, as well as additional beneficial properties of egg yolk in oil paint, including resistance to humidity. The “Madonna of Carnation” is one of Leonardo’s earliest paintings, created at a time when he might have been still trying to master the then newly popular medium of oil paint. Another painting observed during the study was “The Lamentation Over the Dead Christ,” by Botticelli, also on display at the Alte Pinakothek. The work is mostly made with tempera, but oil paint has been used for the background and some secondary elements. “We knew that some parts of the paintings show brushstrokes that are typical for what we call an oil painting, and yet we detected the presence of proteins,” Ranquet said. “Because it’s a very small quantity and they are difficult to detect, this might be dismissed as contamination: In workshops, artists used many different things, and maybe the eggs were just from the tempera.” However, because adding egg yolk had such desirable effects on oil paint, the presence of proteins in the work might be an indication of deliberate use instead, the study suggested. Ranquet hopes that these preliminary findings might attract more curiosity toward this understudied topic. DNA analysis of Beethoven's hair reveals health issues — and a family secret Maria Perla Colombini, a professor of analytical chemistry at the University of Pisa in Italy, who was not involved in the study, agreed. “This exciting paper provides a new scenario for the understanding of old painting techniques,” she said in an email. “The research group, reporting results from molecular level up to a macroscopic scale, contributes to a new knowledge in the use of egg yolk and oil binders. They are not more looking at simply identifying the materials used by Old Masters but explain how they could produce wonderful and glittering effects by employing and mixing the few available natural materials. They try to discover the secrets of old recipes of which little or nothing is written,” she added. “This new knowledge contributes not only to a better conservation and preservation of artworks but also to a better comprehension of art history.” Top image: The “Mona Lisa” by Leonardo Da Vinci © 2024 Cable News Network.

1,2024-08-05 07:36:42.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-05 04:51:06.000,How Playboy cut ties with Hugh Hefner to create a post-MeToo brand,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/playboy-the-conversation/index.html,2023-04-11 07:10:28.000,"Editor’s Note: The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation. Hugh Hefner launched Playboy Magazine 70 years ago this year. The first issue included a nude photograph of Marilyn Monroe, which he had purchased and published without her knowledge or consent. Hefner went on to build the Playboy brand off the backs of the countless women featured in its pages, whose beauty and performance of heightened feminine sexuality have entertained its readers for generations. Approaching its 70th anniversary in December, Playboy has radically shifted. With the magazine no longer in publication, the Playboy Mansion sold to a developer and London’s last remaining Playboy Club closing in 2021, what is the future for Playboy? The brand is changing to keep up with the post-#MeToo world. Hefner passed away one month before allegations against film producer Harvey Weinstein surfaced in 2017 giving momentum to the #MeToo movement (which saw survivors of sexual assault and harassment speak out against their abusers). READ MORE: Sex, love and companionship … with AI? Why human-machine relationships could go mainstream In recent years, many have re-evaluated Hefner’s legacy and relationships with women. The 2022 docuseries “The Secrets of Playboy” (which aired on Channel 4 in the UK) detailed sexual misconduct accusations against Hefner from several ex-girlfriends, including model Sondra Theodore and TV personality Holly Madison. Hefner and Playboy’s relationship with women has been complicated. Playboy was an early supporter of abortion rights, helped fund the first rape kit and was at times an early proponent of inclusivity (for example featuring transgender model, Caroline “Tula” Cossey, in its June 1981 issue). But most women featured in Playboy have fit within a narrow beauty standard — thin, white, able-bodied and blonde. Meanwhile Hefner’s personal relationship with his much younger girlfriends reportedly followed patterns of control and emotional abuse. Ex-girlfriend Holly Madison described Hefner as treating her “like a glorified pet” in her 2015 memoir, “Down the Rabbit Hole.” Hefner’s passing meant he evaded reckoning with the #MeToo movement. Playboy, however, responded, releasing a statement in which it affirmed support for the women featured in “The Secrets of Playboy” and called Hefner’s actions “abhorrent.” The statement declared that the brand was no longer affiliated with the Hefner family and would be focusing on aspects of the company’s legacy that align with values of sex positivity and free expression. READ MORE: The ‘milf’: a brief cultural history, from Mrs Robinson to Stifler’s mom Today, Playboy is a very different company from the one Hefner launched nearly 70 years ago. Roughly 80% of Playboy staff identify as women, according the company, and its motto has changed from “Entertainment for Men” to “Pleasure for All.” Shares in the company are publicly traded and 40% of its board and management are women. The company has also moved towards more creator-led content through its app, Playboy Centerfold. Similar to subscription content service OnlyFans, Playboy Centerfold allows subscribers to view content from and interact with its creators, which it call “bunnies.” On the app, creators — or bunnies — are able portray their own bodies however they wish, putting the power back in their hands. Perhaps Playboy’s future is no longer in serving the male gaze, but instead the very audience Hefner dismissed in his first letter from the editor: “If you’re a man between the ages of 18 and 80 Playboy is meant for you … If you’re somebody’s sister, wife or mother-in-law and picked us up by mistake, please pass us along to the man in your life and get back to your Ladies Home Companion.” The stars of Playboy’s mid-2000s reality series, Holly Madison and Bridget Marquardt, are also enjoying a resurgence among fans. “The Girls Next Door” launched in 2004. The show focused on the lives of Hefner’s three girlfriends, Madison, Marquardt and Kendra Wilkinson. It became E’s best performing show and cultivated a new female audience for Playboy. “The Girls Next Door” was a story of complicated empowerment despite patriarchal interference. Its three female protagonists went from being known solely as some of Hefner’s many blonde girlfriends, to celebrities in their own right. They each ultimately broke up with Hefner, leaving the Mansion and going on to lead successful careers. The show’s depiction of Madison, Marquardt and Wilkinson as empowered, fun-loving and complex individuals, who found joy and agency through expressing their sexuality was perhaps what drew so many female fans to the show. However, amid the girls’ fight for agency, Hefner retaliated. The series shows that he maintained final say in every Playboy photograph of the girls, as well as imposing strict curfews and spending allowances. In Madison and Wilkinson’s memoirs, “Down the Rabbit Hole,” and “Sliding into Home,” they claim that production consistently undermined them. They refused to pay them for the first season, didn’t credit them until season four and aired their uncensored nude bodies in foreign broadcasts and DVD releases without consent. READ MORE: #MeToo in space: We must address the potential for sexual harassment and assault away from Earth Fan interest in “The Girls Next Door” remains strong. In August 2022 Madison and Marquardt launched their podcast “Girls Next Level,” where they interview previous playmates and interact with fans. They also recap episodes from their own points of view, unpacking their experiences of working on the show. Having reached 10 million downloads as of February 2023, the success of the podcast — 14 years after the last episode of “The Girls Next Door” — speaks to the cultural legacy of the Playboy brand. It also shows that despite Hefner’s original editor’s note, Playboy resonates with some women. Playboy is now in a post-Hefner era, where the imagery of women found within old issues of Playboy can serve as inspiration for others to enjoy their own sexuality. Whatever the future has for the company, the concept of Playboy has become public property — be that in the appearance of Playboy bunny costumes each Halloween, the popularity of cheeky Playboy logo tattoos or branded lingerie and clothing. In a post-#MeToo era, the women of Playboy are speaking up and taking over. With the mansion gates closed, the bunnies are finally reclaiming the brand as their own.

Inside fashion's worrying runway trend,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/fashion-week-fall-winter-2023-size-diversity-skinny-wegovy/index.html,2023-04-06 20:53:38.000,"Now that the Fall-Winter 2023 catwalks have been disassembled, it’s clear one trend was more pervasive than any collective penchant for ruffles, pleated skirts or tailored coats. Across runways in New York, London, Milan and Paris, there was a notable scarcity of plus-size models. This comes at a time when there are five injectable medications which can be used as appetite suppressants currently available by prescription in the US, stirring much conversation; a sixth medication, Rybelsus, is taken as an oral pill. Two are officially approved in the UK — the largest influx of weight loss medication seen in the country in almost a decade. Dior's landmark Mumbai show signals India's growing luxury status In recent months, injectables such as Wegovy and Ozempic — which share the same active ingredient, semaglutide — have been widely reported as Hollywood’s worst-kept weight loss secret. (Ozempic is intended for use primarily to treat Type 2 diabetes.) Comedian Chelsea Handler claimed her “anti-aging doctor just hands (Ozempic) out to anybody” while appearing on a podcast in January. Even Elon Musk tweeted last year about being on Wegovy. For many fashion commentators and diversity advocates, the Fall-Winter 2023 runways were in sharp contrast to the (albeit limited) progress and heady promise of recent seasons. This rollback has been widely criticized in the style media as such. And its potential impact is being assessed more broadly: With the rise of these weight loss panaceas, the pursuit of size zero is now just a prescription away. In 2020, Jill Kortleve and Paloma Elsesser became the first models outside of a sample size to walk for the Italian fashion house Fendi. (Traditionally, a sample size falls between a US 0-4.) British label Erdem entered the plus-size market in 2021, extending its offering to a UK size 22 (or US size 18). And in January 2022, Valentino made headlines after its haute couture show featured a broad spectrum of body types. But this season, there was a visible lack of curve bodies on their runways — or many others. Fendi and Valentino did not respond when contacted by CNN, while Erdem declined to comment. According to fashion search engine Tagwalk, the number of mid and plus-size models dropped by 24% in comparison to Spring-Summer 2023. Similarly, a size inclusivity report conducted by Vogue Business found that 95.6% of all looks presented for Fall-Winter 2023 were in a size US 0-4. For context, industry market firm Plunkett Research estimated in 2015 that 68% of American women wear a size US 14 or above. “It was a definitive backslide,” said IMG model agent Mina White, who represents plus-size and curve supermodels including Elsesser and Ashley Graham. “It was frustrating to see some of these designers not using curved bodies where they had in the past.” Fendi and Valentino did not respond when contacted by CNN, while Erdem declined to comment. “Watching somebody like Ashley Graham attend the front row for so many of these major houses in full looks (provided by the designer), it was frustrating,” White continued. “They wanted to utilize her image and her social following to command a certain space in the market, but they didn’t want to be reflective on their runways.” For others, even the term “backslide” was too generous. “Slipping back from… what? A glorious time when the average American woman (size 16) was as present on the runways as she is in everyday life? A time when fashion ads cast as many ‘plus-size’ and ‘mid-size’ women as ‘straight-size’ women?” fashion journalist Amy Odell wrote in her Substack newsletter of this past season’s runways. “No one needed any data to understand that representing a wide array of body shapes and sizes in runway shows or in fashion imagery is not a priority for the industry.” That said, a handful of — mostly smaller — brands pushed ahead this season. In London, emerging labels Di Petsa, Karoline Vitto and Sinead O’Dwyer showcased lineups of size-diverse models. Inclusivity at Christian Siriano, Coach, Kim Shui, Collina Strada and Bach Mai stood out in New York; while in Paris, Belgian brand Esther Manas — a consistent flag-bearer for size diversity — staged one of the city’s most refreshing runways with an assortment of fun, sensual, feminine looks that complimented a range of bodies. There was also a smattering of mid- and plus-size castings to be seen elsewhere: Off-White and Michael Kors, for example, featured a few such models. At Harris Reed’s debut for Nina Ricci, Precious Lee opened the show — which also featured three more plus- and mid-size models. Fashion samples and sample size pieces are one-off garments made before an item is mass-produced, typically to be worn during runway shows. Prioritizing the same body type in sample sizes means runway models are more easily interchangeable, saving fashion houses time and money if someone were to drop out or get sick during or after the casting process for a show. It’s also partly why, according to White, casting curve models is still an uphill battle. She says she introduces brands to new faces months in advance of runway season, with their specific measurements up-top and easy to read in all correspondence. “I want to be ahead of that,” White said. “So I’m never told ‘Oh, we wanted to make it work, but we didn’t have her size’ or whatever that conversation might look like.” Look of the Week: What Pope Francis' AI puffer coat says about the future of fashion But despite her efforts, she says she’s frequently told it’s too much of a “financial lift” to make larger samples — even by legacy brands. “I get very upset when brands say that,” White said. “I don’t believe that it is, I believe that it’s people not being properly educated on how to do this right.” Beyond the lack of representation, White notes it’s painful for plus-size consumers to watch brands leverage resources to create custom, made-to-fit pieces for celebrities — all the while claiming the pot is empty for more inclusive runway samples. London-based stylist and editor Francesca Burns agrees sample sizes are part of the problem. In 2020, Burns went viral after she posted on Instagram about a fashion job gone wrong. She says she was sent five looks to style from Celine, none of which fit the size UK 8 (US 4) model booked for the shoot— an 18-year-old on her first job in the business. The experience left her “horrified,” Burns told CNN, recalling what she saw as the model’s shame and embarrassment. “Looking into this girl’s eyes,” Burns said, “she shouldn’t have felt like that.” Burns’ post, which called the current system “unacceptable,” was picked up widely in the fashion media. (When reached by CNN, Celine declined to comment on the incident.) “Ultimately, the desire to see change has to be there,” Burns said. “And I wonder whether luxury has that desire?” Progress has been slow, but not entirely inexistent. Across fashion campaigns, magazine covers and editorial shoots, there is a growing enthusiasm for inclusivity. “I see the options rolling in for the plus-sized talent, and they’re great offerings,” said White. “Great, strong editorials and covers and campaigns. But I do feel like without the clothes, we are going to go back to see more naked curve stories, or lingerie curve stories or a curve girl in a trench coat. That’s what I don’t want.” For British Vogue’s April issue, unveiled March 16, Elsesser, Lee and Jill Kortleve were dubbed “The New Supers.” Preceding the cover story is a letter written by editor-in-chief, Edward Enninful commending the models for “leading the way” and holding “powerful space” in the industry. “Catwalks are once again under scrutiny for a stark lack of body diversity,” read the magazine’s Instagram caption, unveiling the cover. “But this cover was not conceived as a statement. It is a crowning of an all-powerful trio, the supermodels for a new generation.” But many online were quick to point out the disconnect: Two of the Saint Laurent Spring-Summer 2023 dresses were modeled by plus-size women, though they are not available to buy in most plus sizes. In his own social media post, Enninful wrote about his disappointment at the Fall-Winter 2023 runways. “I thought I had gotten into a time machine. Show after show dominated by one body type, so many limited visions of womanhood… one prescribed notion of beauty prevailed again, and it felt like the reality of so many women around the world were being ignored.” But for White, the power rests within the entire industry — not just at the feet of brands. “I really do believe there should be an industry standard between the (Council of Fashion Designers of America), the British Fashion Council and key editors at some of these major mass market magazines,” she continued. “If there was a call-to-action from these figureheads saying, moving forward samples need to be readily available for a few different body types, we would see significant and impactful change.” Burns agrees there must be a trickle-down effect. “I think a lot of responsibility is put on young designers to solve all these issues around sustainability or issues around body inclusivity,” she said. “It’s important that the big powerhouses, which have the capacity to action change, really take some responsibility.” On March 8, Wegovy — developed primarily as a treatment for those living with obesity and weight-related conditions — was approved in the UK. It’s the second injectable weight management medication to be made available with a prescription via the country’s National Health Service (NHS) in about 3 years, after almost a decade of quiet. Before 2020, the last weight loss medication was approved in the UK was in 2010. Similarly, the US has now approved three weight management injections: Wegovy, Saxenda and IMCIVREE. Medications for type-2 diabetes like Mounjaro and Ozempic are not FDA-approved for weight loss, though some doctors are issuing them at their own discretion. While these medicines are a revolutionary tool for those who struggle to lose weight for genetic or medical reasons, they are at risk of being abused. Semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic, was originally developed for treating type-2 diabetes. It quells hunger signals to the brain by mimicking the hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). “It can slow how quickly your stomach empties out and may give you a little more feeling of feeling full,” said Dr. Robert Lash, an endocrinologist and Chief Medical Officer of the Endocrine Society in Washington, D.C. In clinical trials, over a period of 68 weeks, participants who used the medication in conjunction with eating fewer calories and increasing their physical activity on average lost around 15% of their body weight compared to 2.4% of those using a placebo, according to the manufacturer Novo Nordisk. On March 13, the European Medicines Agency issued a statement warning of an Ozempic shortage that could continue through the year, urging doctors to prioritize prescriptions to diabetics. “Any other use, including for weight management, represents off-label use and currently places the availability of Ozempic for the indicated population at risk,” read the release. Patients typically need a BMI of 27 or higher (along with another weight-related condition like high blood pressure or diabetes) or have a genetic predisposition towards obesity to be prescribed such appetite suppressant medication by their doctor. But talk of these injectables has been sweeping the West. In January, the New York Times reported on the term “Ozempic Face,” coined by a New York-based dermatologist who reported treating several patients with a hollowed-out appearance that can come with rapid weight loss. By the end of February, the medication had made it to the cover of New York Magazine in a feature titled “Life After Food?” Adverts for GLP-1 injections are even blanketing New York City subway stations. And across social media, online forums and private group chats, some people looking to lose weight for primarily aesthetic purposes are searching for a way to skirt the requirements. “I was just looking for a way to lose a few pounds, like 10 to 15 at most,” said one 30-year-old American woman, who wished to remain anonymous, in a phone interview. She scoured social media and forums for guidance on securing a weight loss drug. “I’m certainly a normal BMI, I just have a trip to Mexico coming up and I want to look really good,” she said. Although she says she found a way to access Wegovy, she decided against the medication after considering the cost (which can reach more than $1,000 a month without insurance). “I’ve always very much fit the societal standard but lately I was just like f*ck it, I want to be skinny,” she told CNN. Dr. Lash emphasized the importance of taking weight loss drugs only with medical supervision and a valid prescription. “If somebody was a normal weight and they took this drug because they thought they could be even thinner than they are now, that could lead to complications,” he told CNN, warning of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and even gallbladder problems. “These drugs are not benign, they do have side effects involving the GI tract. There’s no such thing as a free lunch.” Fashion has long promoted size 0 as the ultimate virtue — regardless of its viability for many people, or any health risks. And now with the accessibility of accelerated weight loss medication, the stakes are even higher. For Burns and White, the industry is responsible for amplifying a new, more inclusive vision of beauty. “There’s a very archaic way of looking at women over a size 16 and just assuming that they’re unhealthy or uneducated or unstylish. Or don’t have the resources to buy into luxury,” said White. “The reality is the same women these brands are alienating in their fashion space are the same women running out to buy their handbags, shoes, perfumes, cosmetics and skincare.” Not only do designers need to create clothes with this consumer in mind, according to White, but they need to be seen on the runway, too. “It shouldn’t be a conversation. It should just be normalized that we’re not just looking at a single view of beauty,” echoed Burns. Ester Manas and Balthazar Delepierre, whose bridal-inspired Fall-Winter 2023 collection was one of this season’s most size-diverse runways, summarized it best in their accompanying show notes: “The body is not the subject. Because, obviously, at a wedding, everybody is invited. And all to the party. That is where the designer duo Ester and Balthazar take their stand.” © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

1,2024-08-05 07:36:42.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-05 04:51:06.000,Michael Jordan's 1998 NBA Finals sneakers sell for a record $2.2 million,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/michael-jordan-sneakers-1998-finals-sothebys-auction-record/index.html,2023-04-12 03:17:57.000,"Editor’s Note: This story was updated with the final sale price and other details following the auction. In 1998, Michael Jordan laced up a pair of his iconic black and red Air Jordan 13s to bring home a Bulls victory during Game 2 of his final NBA championship — and now they are the most expensive sneakers ever to sell at auction.The game-winning sneakers sold for $2.2 million at Sotheby’s in New York on Tuesday, smashing the sneaker auction record of $1.47 million, set in 2021 by a pair of Nike Air Ships that Jordan wore earlier in his career. Remember when Dennis Rodman put on a wedding dress and claimed to marry himself? The sale arrives during “Jordan Year” — a reference to the NBA star player’s iconic jersey number 23. In January, Air Jordan partnered with Sotheby’s to auction off 13 pairs of retro sneakers that were designed in memory of The Notorious B.I.G. All lots outsold their high estimates of $5,000 by multiples, with the highest selling for more than $32,000. Last year, Jordan’s Game 1 jersey, also from the 1998 finals, became the most expensive item of worn sports memorabilia to sell at auction when it fetched $10.1 million at a Sotheby’s sale. Jordan’s farewell run with the Chicago Bulls is often referred to as “The Last Dance,” after the title of an ESPN and Netflix documentary that chronicled the season. Jordan announced his (second) retirement weeks before the finals, leading to the six-game series against the Utah Jazz becoming the most-watched in NBA history, based on Nielsen TV ratings. (Jordan would later return from 2001 to 2003 to play with the Washington Wizards, but did not win another championship). “Michael Jordan game-worn sports memorabilia has proven time and time again to be the most elite and coveted items on the market,” said Brahm Wachter, Sotheby’s head of streetwear and modern collectables, in a press release prior to the sale. “However, items from his ‘Last Dance’ season are of a greater scale and magnitude as seen with our record-breaking sale of his Game 1 jersey in 2022.” The pair of sneakers sold Tuesday were worn during Game 2, in Salt Lake City, which the Bulls won 93-88 after losing Game 1, with Jordan scoring 37 points. They are the last pair of black and red Air Jordan 13s that Jordan ever wore on the court for an NBA game, a press release from Sotheby’s noted. 13 of the best menswear looks from Oscars history Following Game 2, Jordan signed and gifted the set of worn shoes to the ball boy in the visitor’s locker room, as he was known to do, according to Sotheby’s. The Air Jordan 13 sneakers starred in a sports memorabilia sale called “Victoriam,” which featured items worn by athletes including Tom Brady, Kobe Bryant and Roger Federer. Several other Jordan items were included in the two-part auction, with a game-worn 1998 Bulls jersey and a pair of 1985 Air Jordan 1s fetching $508,000 and $127,000 respectively. Other top lots included one of Kobe Bryant’s LA Lakers shooting shirts, which sold for over $406,000, and a soccer jersey, worn by the late Pelé on his debut for the New York Cosmos in 1975, that sold fetched over $177,000.

1,2024-08-05 07:36:42.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-05 04:51:06.000,The surreal facades of America's strip clubs,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/francois-prost-gentlemens-club/index.html,2023-03-06 14:13:40.000,"Some people travel the world in search of adventure, while others seek out natural wonders, cultural landmarks or culinary experiences. But French photographer François Prost was looking for something altogether different during his recent road trip across America: strip clubs. From Miami to Los Angeles, Prost’s latest book “Gentlemen’s Club” charts his route across the US via nearly 150 strip clubs with names like Pleasures, Temptations and Cookies N’ Cream. There isn’t a single nude woman to be seen, however, as Prost’s camera was exclusively trained on the buildings themselves — and specifically their often-colorful facades. Over the course of five weeks in 2019 he traversed over 6,000 miles, with the resulting photos capturing everything from the pastel hues of Florida’s Club Pink Pussycat to venues hiding in plain sight in the country’s more religious states. “I’d divide these venues into two types: One is very integrated into the public landscape, and one is a bit more hidden and dodgy,” Prost said, speaking to CNN on a video call and email. The first type, he added, could be found in “very American” settings, such as “around amusement parks and fast food and malls.” The latter venues, however, would sometimes look indistinguishable from any store in a strip mall. Prost said he found many such establishments along the Bible Belt, a socially conservative region in the country’s south. He was especially keen to explore the area due to the apparent contrast between the prevalence of strip clubs and what he describes in his book as “conservatism and extreme puritanism.” Prost insisted that he had little interest in the interiors or services of the strip clubs, which he always visited during the day. Instead, he hoped to learn more about American culture by creating objective, documentary-style photographs of establishments sitting at the intersection of sex, gender and commerce. Documenting changing attitudes toward sex through the lens of architecture, he added that the series was primarily of a landscape photography project. Artful photos inside Houston's ONYX strip club tell a story of beauty and confidence “The prism of this theme of strip club facades became a way of studying and trying to understand the country,” he wrote in “Gentlemen’s Club,” photographs from which will feature in an exhibition in Tokyo in March. ”(‘Gentlemen’s Club’ is) an objective panorama of dominant opinions and gender and the sexualization of the feminine image.” The genesis of Prost’s project dates back to his 2018 series, “After Party,” which focused on the flamboyant facades of French nightclubs. He said that people frequently commented that the buildings’ exteriors looked as though they had been ripped straight out of American cities, sparking the idea that he should visit the US and extend the project. As he meticulously planned his trip, he was struck not only by the sheer volume of strip clubs in America but that — unlike In Europe — they often demanded to be seen. Hot pink walls, gigantic nude silhouettes and even candy-cane-striped storefronts made no secret of the kind of entertainment provided inside. From Brutalist Boston to Modernist Palm Springs, America's most eye-catching city halls “A good example would be Las Vegas, where strip clubs are everywhere and their signs blink as much as a fast food (restaurant) or casino sign,” Prost said. Miami’s clubs were often painted in vivid, Wes Anderson-esque hues. Other photos show brightly covered venues contrasting with their sparse desert surroundings. If the establishments were open during the day, Prost would enter and ask for permission to take photos in order “to not look suspicious… and explain what my intentions were,” he said. The interiors rarely lived up to the tantalizing promises plastered across the signs outside, but the photographer met a host of characters during his five-week trip, from indifferent bouncers to managers who were thrilled about the project. “Most of the time, people were OK — 99% of them would say yes to a facade picture,” he said, adding they typically wouldn’t mind his presence, as long as he didn’t take photos of patrons or dancers. “Some would think that it was a bit strange, some would be really excited about it and give me their business card to send me the picture when it was done,” he said. Prost said his biggest surprise, however, was how “normalized” strip clubs appeared to be in everyday life. As he reflects in his book, “The relationship that Americans seem to have with strip clubs is quite different to what you see in Europe. Going to a strip club seems to be a lot more normalized … You go as a couple, or amongst friends at night to have fun.” Giant doughnuts and a shoe you can walk into: California's strangest buildings He was struck, for instance, by the fact that so many Las Vegas strip clubs doubled as restaurants — with many boasting happy hour deals, buffets and special discounts for truck drivers or construction workers. “I noticed a few strip clubs that would advertise being a strip club and steakhouse, so you could eat a big piece of meat (while) watching strippers. That is also something that seems very American to me,” he said, adding: “I heard from some people I met in Portland there are even strip clubs (that offer) vegan food.” The facades are littered with jokes like “My sex life is like the Sahara, 2 palms, no dates” and pun-based names like Booby Trap and Bottoms Up. Prost’s documentarian approach heightens the signs’ surreal comedy. But it also doubles as a neutral lens through which viewers can make up their own minds about the objectification of women. By honing in on the faceless dancing bodies of female silhouettes and the quintessential “girls girls girls” signs, “Gentleman’s Club” explores the commodification of women who are, in reality, completely absent in Prost’s works (an observation reflected in the book’s title, which is a phrase that crops up numerous times on signs throughout his photographs). The strip clubs he visited market women as things to be consumed, from the many food-themed names to an advertisement reading, “1,000’s of beautiful girls & three ugly ones.” For his next project, Prost plans to visit Japan to document the nation’s love hotels, which occupy a similar role as strip clubs in some parts of the US: open secrets in a conservative society. But the photographer believes the American establishments he visited say something unique about the country — something that is less about sexuality and more about the American dream. Museum of Sex to open new outpost in Miami What his project has shown him is, he said, this: “As long as you’re successful in terms of business, (it doesn’t matter) if your activity deals with sex.” “Gentlemen’s Club” will be exhibited at Agnes b. Galerie Boutique in Tokyo, Japan, between March 17 and April 15, 2023. The book, published by Fisheye Editions, is available now. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

1,2024-08-05 07:36:42.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-05 04:51:06.000,Here's the real reason to turn on airplane mode when you fly,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/airplane-mode-reasons-why/index.html,2023-04-07 12:52:23.000,"Editor’s Note: The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation. We all know the routine by heart: “Please ensure your seats are in the upright position, tray tables stowed, window shades are up, laptops are stored in the overhead bins and electronic devices are set to flight mode.” Now, the first four are reasonable, right? Window shades need to be up so we can see if there’s an emergency, such as fire. Tray tables need to be stowed and seats upright so we can get out of the row quickly. Laptops can become projectiles in an emergency, as the seat back pockets are not strong enough to contain them. And mobile phones need to be set to flight mode so they can’t cause an emergency for the airplane, right? Well, it depends whom you ask. Aviation navigation and communication relies on radio services, which has been coordinated to minimize interference since the 1920s. The digital technology currently in use is much more advanced than some of the older analog technologies we used even 60 years ago. Research has shown personal electronic devices can emit a signal within the same frequency band as the aircraft’s communications and navigation systems, creating what is known as electromagnetic interference. Half of the world's 10 busiest airports for 2022 are in one country But in 1992, the US Federal Aviation Authority and Boeing, in an independent study, investigated the use of electronic devices on aircraft interference and found no issues with computers or other personal electronic devices during non-critical phases of flight. (Takeoffs and landings are considered the critical phases.) The US Federal Communications Commission also began to create reserved frequency bandwidths for different uses – such as mobile phones and aircraft navigation and communications – so they do not interfere with one another. Governments around the globe developed the same strategies and policies to prevent interference problems with aviation. In the EU, electronic devices have been allowed to stay on since 2014. What's the safest seat on a plane? We asked an aviation expert Why then, with these global standards in place, has the aviation industry continued to ban the use of mobile phones? One of the problems lies with something you may not expect – ground interference. Wireless networks are connected by a series of towers; the networks could become overloaded if passengers flying over these ground networks are all using their phones. The number of passengers that flew in 2021 was over 2.2 billion, and that’s half of what the 2019 passenger numbers were. The wireless companies might have a point here. Of course, when it comes to mobile networks, the biggest change in recent years is the move to a new standard. Current 5G wireless networks – desirable for their higher speed data transfer – have caused concern for many within the aviation industry. Radio frequency bandwidth is limited, yet we are still trying to add more new devices to it. The aviation industry points out that the 5G wireless network bandwidth spectrum is remarkably close to the reserved aviation bandwidth spectrum, which may cause interference with navigation systems near airports that assist with landing the aircraft. Airport operators in Australia and the US have voiced aviation safety concerns linked to 5G rollout, however it appears to have rolled out without such problems in the European Union. Either way, it is prudent to limit mobile phone use on planes while issues around 5G are sorted out. Most airlines now provide customers with Wi-Fi services that are either pay-as-you-go or free. With new Wi-Fi technologies, passengers could theoretically use their mobile phones to make video calls with friends or clients in-flight. On a recent flight, I spoke with a cabin attendant and asked her opinion on phone use during flights. It would be an inconvenience for cabin crew to wait for passengers to finish their call to ask them if they would like any drinks or something to eat, she stated. On an airliner with 200+ passengers, in-flight service would take longer to complete if everyone was making phone calls. For me, the problem with in-flight use of phones is more about the social experience of having 200+ people on a plane, and all potentially talking at once. In a time when disruptive passenger behaviour, including “air rage”, is increasingly frequent, phone use in flight might be another trigger that changes the whole flight experience. Disruptive behaviours take on various forms, from noncompliance to safety requirements such as not wearing seat belts, verbal altercations with fellow passengers and cabin crew, to physical altercations with passengers and cabin crews – typically identified as air rage. In conclusion – in-flight use of phones does not currently impair the aircraft’s ability to operate. But cabin crews may prefer not to be delayed in providing in-flight service to all of the passengers – it’s a lot of people to serve. However, 5G technology is encroaching on the radio bandwidth of aircraft navigation systems; we’ll need more research to answer the 5G question regarding interference with aircraft navigation during landings. Remember that when we are discussing the two most critical phases of flight, takeoffs are optional – but landings are mandatory.

1,2024-08-05 07:36:42.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-05 04:51:06.000,"'I was up to my waist down a hippo's throat.' He survived, and here's his advice",https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/hippo-attack-avoid-survive-paul-templer/index.html,2023-04-12 12:44:43.000,"Paul Templer was living his best life. He was 28 and conducting tours in his native Zimbabwe, with a focus on photographic safaris. He had been away for a few years, including a stint in the British army. But he had returned to Africa’s bush country “and fell back in love with it. The wildlife, the flora, the fauna, the great outdoors, the space – just everything about it. I was at home.” Templer said Zimbabwe’s guide certification program was rigorous, and there was a lot of pride among the guides who passed. He reveled in showing tourists the area’s majestic wildlife – including the water-loving, very territorial hippos. “It was idyllic,” he told CNN Travel. “Life was really, really good – until one day I had a really bad day at the office.” March 9, 1996. A Saturday. Templer learned a good friend who was to lead a canoe safari down the Zambezi River had malaria. He agreed to take his pal’s place. “I loved that stretch of the river. It was an area I know like the back of my hand.” The expedition consisted of six safari clients (four Air France crewmembers and a couple from Germany), three apprentice guides plus Templer. They had three canoes – clients in the first two seats and a guide in the back. Then one apprentice guide was in a one-person safety kayak. And down the famed Zambezi they went. “Things were going the way they were supposed to go. Everyone was having a pretty good time.” Eventually, they came across a pod of about a dozen hippos. That’s not unexpected on the Zambezi, Africa’s fourth-longest river. They weren’t alarmed at first as they were at a safe distance. But “we were getting closer, and I was trying to take evasive action. … The idea was let’s just paddle safely around the hippos.” Templer’s canoe led the way, with the other two canoes and kayak to follow. He pulled into a little channel waiting on the others. But the third canoe had fallen back from the group and was off the planned course. Templer’s not sure how that happened. Suddenly, there’s this big thud. And I see the canoe, like the back of it, catapulted up into the air. Paul Templer “Suddenly, there’s this big thud. And I see the canoe, like the back of it, catapulted up into the air. And Evans, the guide in the back of the canoe, catapulted out of the canoe.” The clients managed to remain in the canoe somehow. “Evans is in the water, and the current is washing Evans toward a mama hippo and her calf 150 meters [490 feet] away. … So I know I’ve got to get him out quickly. I don’t have time to drop my clients off.” He yells to Ben, one of the other guides, to retrieve the clients who were in the canoe that had been attacked. Ben got the clients to safety on a rock in the middle of the river that hippos couldn’t climb. Meanwhile, Templer turned his canoe around to get Evans. The plan was to pull alongside of him and pull him into Templer’s canoe. “I was paddling towards him … getting closer, and I saw this bow wave coming towards me. If you’ve ever seen any of those old movies with a torpedo coming toward a ship, it was kind of like that. I knew it was either a hippo or a really large crocodile coming at me,” he said. “But I also knew that if I slapped the blade of my paddle on water … that’s really loud. And the percussion underwater seems to turn the animals away,” he said. “So I slapped the water, and as it was supposed to do, the torpedo wave stops.” He was getting closer to Evans, but they were also getting closer to the female and calf. “I’m leaning over – it’s kind of a made-for-Hollywood movie – Evans is reaching up. … Our fingers almost touched. And then the water between us just erupted. Happened so fast I didn’t see a thing.” What happened next was nightmarish and surreal. “My world went dark and strangely quiet.” Templer said it took a few seconds to figure out what was going on. “From the waist down, I could feel the water. I could feel I was wet in the river. From my waist up, it was different. I was warm, and it wasn’t wet like the river, but it wasn’t dry either. And it was just incredible pressure on my lower back. I tried to move around; I couldn’t. “I realized I was up to my waist down a hippo’s throat.” There’s a good reason a fully grown hippopotamus can fit a large portion of a fully grown adult in its mouth. Hippos can grow up to 16.5 feet long (5 meters), 5.2 feet tall (1.6 meters) and weigh up to 4.5 tons (4 metric tonnes), according to National Geographic. They sport enormous mouths and can open their strong jaws to 150 degrees. Their teeth might be the most frightening thing of all. Their molars are used for eating plants, but their sharp canines, which might reach 20 inches (51 centimeters), are for defense and fighting. Their bite is almost three times stronger than that of a lion. One bite from a hippo can possibly cut a human body in half. They’re found naturally in various parts sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in East and Southern Africa, living in or near rivers and other water sources. (And they are an invasive species in Colombia thanks to escapees from drug lord Pablo Escobar’s menagerie). Hippos are very territorial and might aggressively attack any animal encroaching on their territory, including hyenas, lions and crocodiles. They also kill people. That we know for sure. Many internet sources say around 500 a year, but an exact figure is still uncertain because some attacks and deaths come in very remote regions and don’t get reported. “The question I get asked the most when people find out I study hippos is: ‘Is it true hippos kill more people than any animal?’ Rebecca Lewison, conservation ecologist and associate professor at San Diego State University, told CNN Travel in an email interview. How to survive a cobra bite -- or better yet, avoid one entirely “I’m not entirely sure where that started but … there is no authority or reliable data. People are surprised that hippos kill people. They look slow, and they are mostly in water. There are some nonfatal interactions, but people (or hippos) tend to fare badly from interactions.” Dr. Philip Muruthi, chief scientist and vice president of species conservation and science of the African Wildlife Foundation, said the AWF doesn’t have a credible source on the number of attacks or fatalities either. While more stats need to be collected, one study found that the probability of being killed by a hippopotamus attack is in the range of 29% to 87% – higher than that of a grizzly bear attack at 4.8%, shark attack at 22.7% and crocodile attack at 25%. Those were rather bad odds of survival working against Templer. “I’m guessing I was wedged so far down its throat it must have been uncomfortable because he spat me out. So I burst to the surface, sucked a lungful of fresh air and I came face to face with Evans, the guide who I was trying to rescue. And I said, ‘We got to get out of here!’ ” So once again, I’m up to my waist down the hippo’s throat. But this time, my legs are trapped but my hands are free. Paul Templer But Evans was in serious trouble. Templer started swimming back for him “and I was just moving in for your classic lifesaver’s hold when – WHAM! – I got hit from below. So once again, I’m up to my waist down the hippo’s throat. But this time my legs are trapped but my hands are free.” He tried to go for his gun, but he was being thrashed around so much he couldn’t grab it. The hippo – which turned out to be an older, aggressive male – spat Templer out a second time. “This time when I come to the surface I look around, there’s no sign of Evans.” Templer assumed Evans had been rescued, and he tried to escape himself. “I’m making pretty good progress and I’m swimming along there and I come up for the stroke and swimming freestyle and I look under my arm – and until my dying day I’ll remember this – there’s this hippo charging in towards me with his mouth wide open bearing in before he scores a direct hit.” This time, Templer was sideways in the hippo’s mouth, legs dangling out one side of the mouth, shoulders and head on the other side of its mouth. “And then he just goes berserk. … When hippos are fighting, the way they fight is they try to tear apart and just destroy whatever it is they’re attacking,” Templer said. “For me, fortunately everything was happening in slow motion. So when he’d go under water, I’d hold my breath. When we were on the surface, I would take a deep breath and I would try to hold onto tusks that were boring through me” to stop from being ripped apart. Templer said one of the clients watching the horror later described it like a “vicious dog trying to rip apart a rag doll.” He figures the whole attack took about three and a half minutes. Meanwhile, apprentice guide Mack in the safety kayak – “showing incredible bravery, risking his life to save mine – pulls his boat in inches from my face.” Templer managed to grab a handle on the kayak, and “Mack dragged me to the relative safety of this rock.” The expedition was still in one hell of a mess, though. People living near hippo territory are more likely victims of attacks than tourists, said Lewison. “Most of the attacks happen in the water, but because hippos raid crops on farms, there are also attacks on people trying to protect their crops. There are some tourists, but largely the attacks are happening to local residents,” Lewison said. Human encroachment from Africa’s booming population makes matters worse, increasing the chances of deadly interactions, she said. You encounter a bear in the wild. Do you know what to do next? Despite the encounters gone bad, sub-Saharan Africa depends on hippos. “Hippos are important ecosystem engineers of the ecology of freshwater areas they inhabit. This is through nutrient recycling from dung (they consume large amounts of vegetation),” Muruthi said. “Hippos attack not to eat people, but to get them the hell away from them,” Lewison said. “I don’t think hippos are particularly aggressive, but I think when under pressure, they attack.” Back on the rock in the Zambezi, Templer asked Mack where Evans was. Mack said, “He’s gone, man, he’s just gone.” Templer knew he needed to come up with a plan to get them off the rock and to the riverbank, but “first I needed to settle myself down.” He assessed the situation: One man missing. The first aid kit, radio and gun all gone. Six scared clients, two canoes and one paddle left. And his own body was shattered. “My left foot was especially bad; it looked as if someone had tried to beat a hole through it with a hammer.” He couldn’t move his arms. One arm from elbow down was “crushed to a pulp.” Blood was bubbling out of his mouth. They realized his lung was punctured. Mack rolled Templer over and could see a gaping hole in his back and plugged it with Saran Wrap from a plate of snacks. Templer made the call: No matter the risk, they had to get off that rock. He was loaded into a canoe. Ben paddled. The hippo kept bumping the canoe. He went from being terrified to calm on that ride back. He described “a profound spiritual experience in which I had this incredible sense of peace and realization this was my moment of choice. Like do I go, or do I stay? Do I close my eyes and drift off, or do I fight my way through this and stick around?” It was so intense I thought I was going to die, and when I didn’t, I kind of wished I would. Paul Templer on the pain after the attack “I chose to stick around, and as soon as I made that choice, it was more pain than I could ever imagine I could endure. It was so intense I thought I was going to die, and when I didn’t, I kind of wished I would.” Ben and Templer made it out of the river, but without finding Evans. His body was found three days later. They concluded he had drowned because he didn’t have any signs of animal attack on him. “Evans did nothing wrong. The fact that he died was purely a tragedy.” Meanwhile, some people on shore had realized something was wrong in the river. A well-trained Zimbabwe rescue team was able to safely ferry everyone else off the rock. “And that was my bad day at the office.” Templer was out of the river but not out of the woods. It took eight hours to drive him to the nearest hospital. In a month’s time, he had several major surgeries. He thought he would lose one leg and both arms. His surgeon didn’t think he’d live. But not only did the surgeon save Templer’s life, he saved his legs and one arm. The other arm, however, was beyond salvation. If you're attacked by an alligator, here's how to fight for your life He realized that in the ICU when he woke up and was feeling for his left hand. It was gone. “I just remember feeling devastated. I spent my whole life being active and it was almost more than I could bare.” But then he was flooded with relief to realize his right arm and legs had been saved. For the next month, he was “emotionally all over the map.” He got physical and occupational therapy in Zimbabwe and then more in the United Kingdom. He got a prosthesis “and then just started trying to get back to life.” Templer, Muruthi and Lewison all say safe outings start with education – and avoiding trouble in the first place. “Hippos have no interest in dealing with people. Stay away from them, and they will leave you alone. They are not hunting humans,” Lewison said. “Do not get close to them,” Muruthi said. “They don’t want any intrusion. … They’re not predators; it’s by accident if they’re injuring people.” Want close-up views and photos of the creatures? Instead of venturing too close, invest in good binoculars and telephoto camera lenses. Follow the rules. If you are a tourist, and it says ‘Stay in your vehicle,’ then stay in your vehicle. Philip Muruthi on avoiding hippo attacks Do not walk along well-worn hippo paths, stay close to your group and don’t approach them from behind, Muruthi said. “Follow the rules. If you are a tourist, and it says ‘Stay in your vehicle,’ then stay in your vehicle. And even when you’re in your vehicle, don’t drive it right to the animal.” Muruthi also advised that your party make some noise in areas known for hippos. “It’s good for them to know you’re around.” “Hippos usually come out of water late in the evening and at night to forage, so avoid trekking along the river at that time,” Muruthi said. Also stay on high alert during the dry season when food is scarce. Get to know the signs of disturbed hippos, Muruthi advised, in case you wander too closely. An agitated one will open its mouth wide and yawn as aggressive display. Also watch for a head thrown back, shaking of the head, grunting and snorting. “These are signs you should have left already!” Muruthi said. If you’ve attracted unwanted attention, Muruthi said to always remember you cannot outrun a hippo. They may look sluggish, but they can run 30 mph (almost 43 kph). Instead, you should try to climb a tree or find an obstacle to put between you and the hippo such as a rock or anthill. Muruthi, Lewison and Templer all said never stay between a hippo and the water. If it’s charging you, run parallel to the water source. As with so many other protective female animals, never get between a mama hippo and her young, Templer said. He was alone, deep in the moutains. And a rattlesnake just bit him. What if you’re in a small watercraft? “Typically, if a hippo is going to be attacking, you’ll see it coming way before. There will be that bow wave. … If you slap the water, the percussion 99.9 times out of 100 will turn the hippo,” Templer said. “If you’re in a canoe and a hippo knocks you in the water, get away from the canoe. The hippo is going for this big shape, getting it off its territory.” It’s also safer to view hippos on the water in a larger vessel, which the animal would have a harder time capsizing, Muruthi said. Unlike attacks by some other wild animals, humans are almost defenseless once an attack by a large hippo begins. “Once attacked, there is nothing you can do,” Muruthi said. “Fight for dear life and watch for any chance to escape.” He said you could try to poke at the eyes or any spot that might inflict unexpected pain. But given the size just of a hippo head, even that’s a tall order. Hippos typically hole punch you, so there isn’t much you can do if they get hold of you. Rebecca Lewison “Hippos typically hole punch you, so there isn’t much you can do if they get hold of you,” Lewison said. Based on his attack, Templer said try not to panic “when dragged underwater. Remember to suck in air if on the surface.” Another hippo attack survivor in this National Geographic video also was able to conserve her breath. She also grabbed the hippo’s snout, and one expert in the video theorizes that might have startled the hippo into letting her go. Two years after that attack, Templer said that he and a team made the longest recorded descent of the Zambezi River to date. It took three months and covered 1,600 miles (2,575 kilometers). How did Templer find the resilience to reclaim his life? After a particularly rough day trying to maneuver in a wheelchair, he said that his surgeon told him: “You’re the sum of your choices. You’re exactly who, what and where you choose to be in life.” Templer said he focused on what’s possible vs. what he’s lost. “If you look for what’s possible, it generally is.” Templer later moved to United States; got married to the sister of a journalist on the record-setting Zambezi trip; wrote the book “What’s Left of Me”; and is a speaker. Should people be afraid to even go on safari – especially in hippo areas – after learning of a harrowing story like Templer’s? Muruthi said go, but go smartly. Be sure to get advice from professional tour guides – and then follow their guidance, Muruthi said. “In Kenya, for example, contact the Kenya Professional Safari Guides Association,” he said. Templer said his attack was an “anomaly,” and he doesn’t want anyone to be dissuaded by what happened on his 1996 river run. “My biggest counsel would be: Absolutely go and do it. But hook yourself up with someone who knows what they’re doing out there. But by all means, go out … and experience it.” © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Get the latest news in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments. He’d spent years backpacking around the world, and Japanese traveler Daisuke Kajiyama was finally ready to return home to pursue his long-held dream of opening up a guesthouse. In 2011, Kajiyama arrived back in Japan with his Israeli partner Hila, who he met in Nepal, and the pair set about finding the perfect location for their future venture. However, there were a couple of major stumbling blocks in their way. To start with, Kajiyama had very little money to speak of after years of globetrotting around destinations like Korea, Taiwan, India, Nepal, Guatemala, Cuba and Canada. He also happened to have his heart set on a traditional Japanese house, typically known as kominka, which are usually passed down over generations. “I wanted to have a traditional house in the countryside,” Kajiyama tells CNN Travel, explaining that he was determined to find two houses located next to each other, so that he and Hila could live in one, while the other would be a guesthouse that they’d run together. “I had a vision.” This US couple bought and renovated a 14th-century Italian home When he was unable to find anything that met his requirements, Kajiyama decided to shift his search to include the growing number of abandoned homes in the country. As younger people ditch rural areas in pursuit of jobs in the city, Japan’s countryside is becoming filled with “ghost” houses, or “akiya.” According to the Japan Policy Forum, there were 61 million houses and 52 million households in Japan in 2013, and with the country’s population expected to decline from 127 million to about 88 million by 2065, this number is likely to increase. Kajiyama was driving around Tamatori, a small village located in the Shizuoka prefecture, between Kyoto and Tokyo, surrounded by green tea plantations and rice fields, when he came across an elderly woman farming, and decided to approach her. “I said ‘Do you know if there are any empty houses around here?’ And she just pointed,” he recalls. He looked over at the area that she was signaling to and spotted two neglected houses side by side – a former green tea factory and an old farmer’s home – located close to a river. Both properties had been uninhabited for at least seven years and needed a huge amount of work. Kajiyama asked the woman to contact the owner to find out if they’d be interested in selling. “The owner said that no one could live there, as it was abandoned,” he says. “But he didn’t say ‘no.’ Everybody was always saying ‘no.’ But he didn’t. So I felt there was a small chance.” Expats buy Japanese country house for a song and get way more than they bargained for Kajiyama returned to visit the houses around five times, before going to visit the owner himself to negotiate an agreement that would see him use the old green tree factory as a home, and convert the farmer’s house into the guesthouse he’d always envisioned. While he was keen to purchase both of the homes, he explains that the traditions around home ownership in Japan mean that he is unable to do so until it’s passed down to the son of the current owner. “They said ‘if you take all the responsibility yourself, you can take it.’ So we made an agreement on paper,” he says. Both he and Hila were aware that they had a lot of work ahead of them, but the couple, who married in 2013, were thrilled to be one step closer to having their own guesthouse in an ideal spot. “It’s a very nice location,” says Kajiyama. “It’s close to the city, but it’s really countryside. Also people still live here and go to work [in the city]. “The house is also in front of the river, so when you go to sleep you can hear the sound of the water.” According to Kajiyama, the process of clearing the house, which is around 90 years old, before beginning the renovation works was one of the hardest parts of the process, simply because there was so much stuff to sort through. However, he was able to repurpose some of the items. During the first year, he spent a lot of time connecting with locals, gaining knowledge about the home, and helping the local farmers with farming for the first year or so. Although he wasn’t hugely experienced with renovation work, he had spent some time farming and completing building while he was backpacking, and had also taken odd jobs fixing peoples homes. He completed much of the work on the guesthouse himself, replacing the floors and adding in a toilet, which he says was a wedding present from his parents, at a cost of around $10,000. “I’m not really a professional,” he says.” I like to do carpentry and I enjoy creating things, but I have no experience in my background. “From my several years of backpacking, I saw so many interesting buildings, so many houses of interesting shapes and I’ve been collecting those in my brain.” Kajiyama was determined to keep the house as authentic as possible by using traditional materials. He saved money by collecting traditional wood from building companies who were in the process of breaking down traditional houses. “They need to spend the money to throw it away,” he explains. “But for me, some of the stuff is like treasure. So I would go and take the material that I wanted. “The house is a very, very old style,” he says. “So it wouldn’t look nice if I brought in more modern materials. It’s totally authentic.” He explains that very little work had previously been done to the house, which is quite unusual for a home built so many years ago. “It’s totally authentic,” he says. “Usually, with traditional houses, some renovations are made to the walls, because the insulation is not so strong. So you lose the style.” He says he received some financial support from the government, which meant he was able to bring in a carpenter and also benefited from Japan’s working holiday program, which allows travelers to work in exchange for food and board, when he needed extra help. After doing some research into Japanese guesthouse permits, he discovered that one of the simplest ways to acquire one would be to register the property as an agriculture guesthouse. As the area is filled with bamboo forests, this seemed like a no-brainer, and Kajiyama decided to learn everything he could about bamboo farming so that he could combine the two businesses. “This is how I started farming,” he says. In 2014, two years after they began working on the house, the couple were finally able to welcome their first guests. “It was a beautiful feeling,” says Kajiyama. “Of course, this was my dream. But people really appreciate that it was abandoned and I brought it back to life.” He says that hosting guests from all over the world has helped him to stay connected to his former life as a backpacker. “I stay in one place, but people come to me and I feel like I’m traveling,” he says. “Today, it’s Australia, tomorrow it’s the UK and next week South Africa and India. “People come from different places and they invite me to join them for dinner, so sometimes I join someone’s family life.” Sadly, Hila passed away from cancer in 2022. Kajiyama stresses that his beloved wife played a huge part in helping him achieve his dream of having a guesthouse and says he couldn’t have done it without her. “We were really together,” he adds. “She created this place with me. Without her it would not have been like this.” While the three-bedroom guesthouse, which measures around 80 square meters, has been open for around eight years, Kajiyama is still working on it, and says he has no idea when he’ll be finished. “It’s never ending,” he admits. “I’m halfway, I feel. It is beautiful already. But it started off abandoned, so it needs more details. And I’m getting better at creating, so I need time to do it.” He explains that he’s unable to complete work on the home while guests are there. And while the property is closed during the winter, he spends two months as a bamboo farmer and usually spends a month traveling, which doesn’t leave him much time for renovations. “Sometimes I don’t do anything,” he admits. Yui Valley, which offers activities such as bamboo weaving workshops, has helped to bring many travelers to the village of Tamatori over the years. “Most of the guests come after Tokyo, and it’s such a contrast,” he says. “They are really happy to share the nature and the tradition in our house. “Most people have dreamed of coming to Japan for a long time and they have a very short time here. “So they have such a beautiful energy. I’m happy to host in this way and join their holiday time. It’s very special [for me].” Kajiyama estimates that he’s spent around $40,000 on the renovation work so far, and if the feedback from guests, and locals, is anything to go by, it seems to have been money well spent. “People appreciate what I’ve done,” he adds. “So that makes me feel special.” As for Hiroko, the woman who pointed out the house to him over a decade ago, Kajiyama says she’s stunned at the transformation, and is amazed at how many international travelers are coming to Tamatori to stay at Yui Valley. “She cannot believe how much more beautiful it is [now],” he says. “She didn’t think it was going to be like this. So she really appreciates it. She says ‘thank you’ a lot.” Yui Valley, 1170 Okabecho Tamatori, Fujieda, Shizuoka 421-1101, Japan © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Due to its remoteness and short summer season, Mongolia has long been a destination overlooked by travelers. But as the country moves to further open up to tourism by easing its entry conditions for international visitors and upgrading its infrastructure, 2023 might just be the best time yet to get there. Here are 10 reasons travelers should start planning their long-dreamed-of Mongolia visit now. With the government of Mongolia declaring 2023 through 2025 the “Years to Visit Mongolia,” citizens from an additional 34 countries can now visit the country visa-free through the end of 2025. The addition of several European countries, including Denmark, France, Greece, Italy, Norway, Spain, and the UK, as well as Australia and New Zealand, now brings the total number of countries and territories on the visa-exempt list to 61. The full list is here. After years of delays, a pandemic and several controversies, the newly built Chinggis Khaan International Airport finally opened in the summer of 2021. With the ability to handle approximately 3 million passengers a year (double that of the old airport), the addition of 500 new aircraft parking spaces and the infrastructure to support an increase in domestic as well as budget flights, the airport is a welcome addition to the country’s efforts to grow tourism. Budget flights to Hong Kong from EZNIS Airways have been relaunched since the airport’s opening, and talks to resume direct flights to the United States are reportedly underway. The recently opened Chinggis Khaan Museum offers a beautiful, fresh look at Mongolia’s tumultuous history. With more than 10,000 artifacts spanning over 2,000 years, the museum explores the history of the Mongols and the empire they created – and eventually lost. The museum’s artifacts are presented over eight floors, with six permanent and two temporary exhibition halls. Guided tours are offered in English every Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. free of charge. When most people think of Mongolia, music festivals and conservation-focused art installations in the heart of one of the world’s largest deserts are the last things to come to mind. But that’s all changing thanks to festivals like Playtime, Spirit of Gobi, INTRO Electronic Music Festival and the Kharkhorum 360 Visual Art & Music Experience. Placing international bands, DJs, and musicians from around the world alongside Mongolia’s eclectic mix of rappers, bands and folk singers, the country just might be one of the world’s most underrated places for festival lovers. The annual Naadam event has always been a great reason to visit Mongolia, but now that the festival has just celebrated its 100 year anniversary, 2023 is as good a time as ever to attend. While the festival’s origins are rooted in the days of Genghis Khan, when he used horse racing, wrestling and archery competitions to keep his warriors in shape between battles, Naadam only officially became a national holiday 100 years ago. Today, the festival – held in Ulaanbaatar at the National Sports Stadium, has a few more bells and whistles than it did during the days of the Great Khan. A seat at July 11’s opening ceremony is always one of the hardest tickets to score in town. Mounted archery is seeing a resurgence in Mongolia thanks to guys like Altankhuyag Nergui, one of the most accomplished archers in the sport and his archery academy, Namnaa. Here, locals learn the fundamentals of Mongolian archery before mounting a horse and taking their new found skills to another level. In the summer months, students and academy members put on weekly shows for interested spectators. The academy also offers day-long training sessions for those wanting to try this intense sport. Speaking of giving life to Mongolia’s most ancient traditions, the resurrection of Mongol bichig, or the traditional Mongolian script written from top to bottom and read from left to right, has also seen a major resurgence in recent years. Visit the Erdenesiin Khuree Mongolian Calligraphy Center in Karakorum to learn from master calligraphist Tamir Samandbadraa Purev about this important cultural heritage. And, while you’re there, browse the yurts filled with Tamir’s works. Pair the release of Husqvarna’s new Norden 901 Expedition motorbike with Nomadic Off-Road’s newly announced Eagle Hunter Tour, and you have one of the fastest adventures in Mongolia. The tour takes six riders 1,700 kilometers from Ulaanbaatar to Bayan-Ulgii, where riders eventually meet their hosts, Mongolia’s famous eagle hunters. The only thing faster than this adventure is the rate at which Nomadic Off-Road’s tours sell out. Capturing the art of the last eagle hunters of Mongolia Professional musher Joel Rauzy has been leading dogsledding tours across the frozen Lake Khuvsgul for 18 years. With fewer crowds, lower hotel rates and the chance to see one of the largest freshwater lakes in the world completely frozen over, winter in Mongolia is something else to see and experience. Rauzy’s company, Wind of Mongolia, offers tours of the lake, where each person is assigned their own sled and dogs for the journey. Following Rauzy’s lead, mushers will make a loop of the lake. Activities include ice fishing, while travelers stay in winterized yurts and spend time with nomadic families along the journey. Nestled in the heart of Selenge province on the Yeruu River, Yeruu Lodge is the brainchild of Norwegian founder Eirik Gulsrud Johnsen, who first visited Mongolia in 2017. With a minimal Scandinavian-style restaurant and dining area, a handful of fully kitted out yurts for guests to stay in, two pétanque courts, kayaks, a driving range, mountain bikes and a yoga area, the lodge is a destination for nature lovers. Completely off-grid, the lodge runs off solar panels, uses of thermal heating, and all of the property’s water comes from an on-property well and is recycled after use. Additionally, all glass, metal and plastic used at the lodge is also recycled, and food waste is turned into compost used to grow vegetables, berries and herbs onsite. The lodge is set to open in April 2023. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved. CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."

In September, we’re celebrating superlatives as we look at some of the world’s biggest, tallest and most expensive attractions and destinations. Having lived in Beijing for almost 12 years, I’ve had plenty of time to travel widely in China. I’ve visited more than 100 cities, not to mention countless towns and villages throughout the mainland’s 31 provinces. Looking back, I’ve come to realize it was my frequent visits to different parts of the Great Wall in Beijing that were a driving force behind my desire to explore the rest of the country and, along with it, the many sections of wall that lie outside the capital’s boundaries. Work on the Great Wall began more than 2,500 years ago, its origins dating back to China’s Spring and Autumn Period of around 770 BCE to 476 BCE. Various sections were added in subsequent eras as competing dynasties and factions sought to exert their control. Work eventually stopped in the 17th century. What's it like to walk the entire length of China's Great Wall? Though not a single, unbroken structure, the wall spans over 21,000 kilometers, winding through 15 provinces, 97 prefectures and 404 counties. And while certain sections have been incredibly popular among tourists, many parts have slipped into obscurity, disrepair and sometimes oblivion. Whether you’re planning to visit the Great Wall for the first time or the 50th, the following destinations are sure to make your trip to China even more worthwhile. (Check out the above video for dramatic aerial footage of some of these amazing sites.) The Great Wall is not simply a brick and mortar bulwark; in certain places, towers on jagged mountain peaks, fortress towns or even wide rivers count as sections of “wall.” The Turtle City, built in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) as part of the Great Wall’s “Yellow River Defense Line,” was completed in 1608 and was home to around 2,000 infantrymen and 500 cavalry units during peak use. Today, this fortress city is located in the Sitan Township of Jingtai County in north central Gansu province. While there aren’t many real turtles in the “Turtle City,” the garrison town got its nickname due to its unique shape. The south gate acts as the head and the west and east gates as the flippers. The town’s oval wall is the body, while the north gate acts as its tail. As one of the most well-preserved and truly authentic walled cities left in China today, it’s definitely worth your time. Staying in the Jingtai County center is recommended. The ancient city is only a 30-minute cab ride from your lodgings, so you can visit whenever the light is best for photos. When in Jingtai, try local specialties such as the five Buddha tofu and the Jingtai cold mixed noodles – both are spicy vegetarian dishes. A walk through the sprawling night market in Jingtai County People’s Square, which boasts more than 50 snack stalls, is also recommended for adventurous foodies. Regional Chinese food: 8 lesser-known cuisines worth trying Getting there: Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu province, has a major international airport and high-speed train connections from many cities in China. The drive to Yongtai Turtle City from downtown Lanzhou takes about 2.5 hours (195 kilometers). From Lanzhou Zhongchuan Airport, it’s only 1.5 hours (125 kilometers). Mutianyu and Jiankou are two parts of the same Stone Dragon – two contiguous sections of the Great Wall that together stretch for roughly 25 kilometers along Beijing’s mountaintops. Historical records show that millions of men spent centuries constructing the Great Wall. Stand atop the wall at either Mutianyu or Jiankou, and you’ll begin to comprehend the gravity of this statement. These two sections are arguably the two most classic examples of Ming Dynasty Great Wall surviving today, and climbing either is guaranteed to be a life-changing experience. Mutianyu is the best portion of the “tourist wall.” Restored in the 1980s, it’s very commercial but also superbly beautiful. Visitors not up for the hike can take a cable car to the top. Off-the-radar destinations every visitor to China should consider To the west of Mutianyu, Jiankou is colloquially known as the “wild wall” – no ticket needed and not commercialized. That being said, as of 2020, hiking at Jiankou has become somewhat frowned upon by the local government because of safety concerns. Mutianyu and Jiankou are less than a 90-minute drive (without traffic) from downtown Beijing, yet it’s highly recommended to enjoy a night in the countryside if time allows. Jiankou can be accessed via Xizhazi village; if dates align, you might even be able to spend a few days with William Lindesay, world-renowned Great Wall historian, and his wonderful family at The Barracks, their wall-side courtyard home. For lodgings around Mutianyu, The Brickyard is a superbly comfortable choice. In fall and spring, shades of the wall’s gray brick contrast with nature’s vibrant colors. Peak autumn foliage and spring cherry blossoms provide stunning backdrops for photos. For winter sports enthusiasts, there’s skiing and skating next to the Wall at locations not far from Mutianyu. Getting to Mutianyu: Restrictions on applying for temporary driving licenses in China were relaxed in September 2019, so renting a car as a foreign tourist is entirely possible. (International driving licenses are not accepted in China.) You can also hire a car with a driver for the day or take the Mutianyu Special Tourism Bus from the Dongzhimen Wai Bus Station. Getting to Jiankou: Renting a car or booking private transport is recommended. As Xizhazi is a small village, buses are scarce so it can take up to five hours to get there by public transport, as opposed to 90 minutes by car. Bataizi village sits just inside the Motianling section of the Great Wall and is home to the ruins of a Gothic church built in 1876 under the direction of a German missionary. The church has been damaged and repaired numerous times in its nearly 150-year history; the bell tower is the only part still standing. The juxtaposition of its ruins against the rammed-earth Great Wall makes Bataizi a unique place to spend a morning or afternoon. China's best new outdoor attractions After finishing your hike along the wall and visiting the church ruins, drop in to the village’s “new” church to say hello to Father Pan; if you speak Chinese, he can answer any questions about the village’s long connection with Catholicism. Besides Bataizi, Datong should also be on your tourist map; visiting the Yungang Grottoes (a UNESCO world heritage site) and the Hengshan Hanging Temple will make your trip even more memorable. Late summer is an ideal time to visit Bataizi, as you’ll see a wonderful contrast between the Great Wall and the lush green hills. Getting there: Bataizi village is 80 kilometers west of Datong, one of Shanxi province’s largest and most famous cities. Zuoyun County is only 22 kilometers away from Bataizi – about a 35-minute drive. Datong is easily accessible by plane or high-speed train from other cities in China; a taxi from downtown Datong to Bataizi should cost roughly 300 yuan (about $43). Alternatively, you can make your way to Zuoyun County by bus then hop in a taxi. In Datong, luxury seekers will want to head for the five-star Yunzhong Traditional Courtyard Hotel. Zuoyun County has one hotel that can accept foreigners: Zuoyun Jinshan International Hotel. Both can be found on popular hotel booking sites. As the locals say, Laoniuwan is where the Great Wall and the mighty Yellow River shake hands. The Laoniuwan Fortress was built in 1467, while the most famous tower of the Great Wall in this area, Wanghe Tower (literally meaning river-watching tower), was constructed in 1544. Laoniuwan village is located in Pianguan County, part of Xinzhou city in Shanxi province, just across the river from Inner Mongolia. Late summer or early fall is a great time to visit, as you’ll avoid the potentially dangerous mountain roads during spring rainstorms, or being uncomfortably cold in a place without great infrastructure. Along the Great Wall, there are only a few places where it meets bodies of water; of all those, this is the most stunning. A boat ride along the river is highly recommended. You’ll be able to soak in the natural beauty of the Yellow River Gorge while marveling at the steadfast resolve of these ancient architects. Swell life: China's surf scene is heating up Getting there: Laoniuwan is difficult to get to by public transportation. The best option is to rent or book a car to take you from Datong to Laoniuwan via Bataizi – this way, you’ll be able to see two incredible locations along the Great Wall in one trip. Pianguan is the nearest city, about one hour away. Pianguan does not have a train station or an airport. The only option is to arrive by bus. Shuozhou, 140 kilometers from Laoniuwan, has an airport opening later this year. Construction on the Great Wall in Simatai began in 1373. It was expanded and reinforced periodically throughout the Ming Dynasty. The Fairy Tower is one of the best-known towers of the wall at Simatai but also one of the least visited due to how difficult it is to access. Instead, aim to take in incredible views of the Fairy Tower from Wangjing Tower (just a few hundred meters away). It’s a journey that will satiate even the most adventurous hikers, yet can be done without any ropes, ladders or other essential safety gear. As with a visit to Mutianyu/Jiankou, this section of wall is guaranteed to deliver stunning views any time of year. My only suggestion is to wait for a clear day (usually visibility is great the day after it rains or snows), as the view from Wangjing Tower is unobstructed in every direction. The hike to the Fairy Tower will leave you in awe of the Northern Barbarians’ supposed determination to reach the capital; the mountains are nearly impassable on foot, let alone by horse, with sheer cliff faces on either side. It makes for absolutely world-class hiking and an interesting history lesson. Five-star lodgings are available at Hobo Farm; they also have an incredible restaurant that serves delicious Western and Chinese fare. For 4.5 star lodgings with a lower price tag, try Yatou’s Homestay. Both can be found on major hotel booking sites. Getting there: Both the Fairy Tower and Wangjing Tower should be accessed via Tangjiazhai village, located in Beijing’s Miyun district. Tangjiazhai village is 140 kilometers from downtown Beijing, depending on your route. Booking a private car from the city is probably the most time-effective way to get there. You can also take a high-speed train from Beijing Station to Miyun district and switch to a bus or taxi from there. Constructed during the reign of Emperor Jiajing (1507-1567), this single-wall section stands seven meters tall in some spots – no small feat considering it was made by piling stones. It’s located just across the road from the town of Dushikou, in Chicheng in Hebei province. The piled-stone wall at Dushikou is unique, as many other sections of the Great Wall close to Beijing were constructed using kiln-fired bricks. Dushikou is best visited in the summer, specifically July and August, when the rolling hills of the surrounding grasslands are peak green. Cool evenings make for perfect outdoor barbecue/bonfire weather. You’ll be able to find clean and comfortable farmhouse lodgings in Dushikou town; alternatively, Chicheng, 45 minutes away, has a range of hotels to choose from. Lamb skewers and roast leg of lamb are specialties in these parts, as this part of Hebei is very close to the border with Inner Mongolia. Noodle lovers should also try the local oat noodles, which are delicious. Getting there: Thanks to all the infrastructure built for the 2022 Winter Olympics, the drive to Dushikou has been shortened by almost two hours. If you prefer not to drive, hop on a bus to Chicheng from the Liuliqiao Transport Hub in Beijing and take a 45-minute taxi ride to Dushikou. Note that public transportation will take one or two hours longer than private car. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

1,2024-08-05 07:36:42.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-05 04:51:06.000,"Nelly Cheboi, who creates computer labs for Kenyan schoolchildren, is CNN's Hero of the Year",https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/11/us/cnn-heroes-all-star-tribute-hero-of-the-year/index.html,2022-12-12 10:38:27.000,"Nelly Cheboi, who in 2019 quit a lucrative software engineering job in Chicago to create computer labs for Kenyan schoolchildren, is the 2022 CNN Hero of the Year. Related gallery Inside 2022's 'CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute' Online voters selected her from among this year’s Top 10 CNN Heroes. Cheboi’s nonprofit, TechLit Africa, has provided thousands of students across rural Kenya with access to donated, upcycled computers — and the chance at a brighter future. Cheboi accepted the award with her mother, who she said “worked really hard to educate us.” At the beginning of her acceptance speech, Cheboi and her mother sang a song onstage that she explained had a special meaning when she was growing up. As CNN Hero of the Year, Cheboi will receive $100,000 to expand her work. She and the other top 10 CNN Heroes honored at Sunday’s gala all receive a $10,000 cash award and, for the first time, additional grants, organizational training and support from The Elevate Prize Foundation through a new collaboration with CNN Heroes. Nelly will also be named an Elevate Prize winner, which comes with a $300,000 grant and additional support worth $200,000 for her nonprofit. Cheboi grew up in poverty in Mogotio, a rural township in Kenya. “I know the pain of poverty,” said Cheboi, 29. “I never forgot what it was like with my stomach churning because of hunger at night.” A hard-working student, Cheboi received a full scholarship to Augustana College in Illinois in 2012. She began her studies there with almost no experience with computers, handwriting papers and struggling to transcribe them onto a laptop. Related article This CNN Hero upcycles old computers to open new worlds for young Kenyans Everything changed in her junior year, though, when Cheboi took a programming course required for her mathematics major. “When I discovered computer science, I just fell in love with it. I knew that this is something that I wanted to do as my career, and also bring it to my community,” she told CNN. Many basic computer skills were still a steep learning curve, however. Cheboi remembers having to practice touch-typing for six months before she could pass a coding interview. Touch-typing is a skill that is now a core part of the TechLit curriculum. “I feel so accomplished seeing kids that are 7 years old touch-typing, knowing that I just learned how to touch-type less than five years ago,” she said. Once she had begun working in the software industry, Cheboi soon realized the extent of which computers were being thrown away as companies upgraded their technology infrastructure. Related video Watch Sofia Carson perform 'Applause' at CNN Heroes celebration “We have kids here (in Kenya) — myself included, back in the day — who don’t even know what a computer is,” she said. So, in 2018, she began transporting donated computers back to Kenya — in her personal luggage, handling customs fees and taxes herself. “At one point, I was bringing 44 computers, and I paid more for the luggage than I did for the air ticket,” she said. A year later, she co-founded TechLit Africa with a fellow software engineer after both quit their jobs. The nonprofit accepts computer donations from companies, universities and individuals. The hardware is wiped and refurbished before it’s shipped to Kenya. There, it’s distributed to partner schools in rural communities, where students ages 4 to 12 receive daily classes and frequent opportunities to learn from professionals, gaining skills that will help improve their education and better prepare them for future jobs. “We have people who own a specific skill coming in and are just inspiring the kids (with) music production, video production, coding, personal branding,” Cheboi said. “They can go from doing a remote class with NASA on education to music production.” The organization currently serves 10 schools; within the next year, Cheboi hopes to be partnered with 100 more. “My hope is that when the first TechLit kids graduate high school, they’re able to get a job online because they will know how to code, they will know how to do graphic design, they will know how to do marketing,” Cheboi said. “The world is your oyster when you are educated. By bringing the resources, by bringing these skills, we are opening up the world to them.” CNN’s Anderson Cooper and ABC’s Kelly Ripa co-hosted the 16th Annual “CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute,” which featured more than a dozen celebrity presenters. “We’re so deeply honored to be here,” said actress and singer Sofia Carson, who perfomed a song with award-winning songwriter Diane Warren at the event. “Diane wrote this incredible anthem ‘Applause’ for those leading, surviving and fighting and tonight we dedicate this song and performance to our heroes.” Actor Aubrey Plaza introduced CNN Hero Aidan Reilly, who launched his nonprofit while home from college during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic. “From his pandemic couch, Aidan and his friends co-founded Farmlink Project,” Plaza said. The nonprofit connects excess food from farms across the US – food that would otherwise be wasted – to those who need it. “In just two years, he .. has moved more than 70 million pounds,” Plaza added.

And Emmy award-winning actor Justin Theroux brought his rescue dog Kuma, on the stage to honor Carie Broecker ​​and her nonprofit, Peace of Mind Dog Rescue. Two teenagers making a difference in their communities were also honored as 2022 Young Wonders: Ruby Chitsey, a 15-year-old from Harrison, Arkansas, started “Three Wishes for Ruby’s Residents,” which donates personal items to nursing home residents who couldn’t otherwise afford them. Sri Nihal Tammana, a 13-year-old from Edison, New Jersey, started “Recycle My Battery,” which keeps used batteries out of the ecosystem through a network of collection bins. The show also honored two Georgia poll workers, Shaye Moss and her mother Ruby Freeman, whose lives were upended after false allegations that they had been involved in election fraud spread on social media. CNN has partnered with GoFundMe to enable donations to this year’s Top 10 honorees. GoFundMe is the world’s largest fundraising platform that empowers people and charities to give and receive help. Supporters can make online donations to the Top 10 CNN Heroes’ non-profit organizations directly from CNNHeroes.com.

2,2024-08-05 07:36:42.000,BBC News,2024-08-05 05:36:32.000,Bangladesh clashes: 90 killed in anti-government protests,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8vdd4venj7o,2024-08-04 22:36:10.000,"At least 90 people were killed in Bangladesh on Sunday, amid worsening clashes between police and anti-government protesters. The unrest comes as student leaders have declared a campaign of civil disobedience to demand that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina step down. Thirteen police officers were killed when thousands of people attacked a police station in the district of Sirajganj, police said. The student protest started with a demand to abolish quotas in civil service jobs last month, but has now turned into a wider anti-government movement. Both police and some supporters of the governing party were seen shooting at anti-government protesters with live ammunition. Police also used tear gas and rubber bullets. The total death toll since the protest movement began in July now stands at over 280. A nationwide overnight curfew has been in place since 18:00 (12:00 GMT). The UN's human rights chief, Volker Türk, called for an end to the ""shocking violence"" and urged restraint from Bangladeshi politicians and security forces. He expressed particular concern over a mass march planned in Dhaka on Monday, warning of a risk of ""further loss of life and wider destruction"". ""The government must cease targeting those participating peacefully in the protest movement, immediately release those arbitrarily detained, restore full internet access, and create conditions for meaningful dialogue,"" Mr Turk added. The continuing effort to suppress popular discontent, including through the excessive use of force, and the deliberate spread of misinformation and incitement to violence, must immediately cease,"" Mr Türk added. Amid calls for her resignation, Ms Hasina sounded defiant. Speaking after a meeting with security chiefs, she said the protesters were ""not students but terrorists who are out to destabilise the nation"". On Sunday, Law and Justice Minister Anisul Huq told the BBC’s Newshour programme that authorities were showing “restraint”. “If we had not shown restraint, there would have been a bloodbath. I guess our patience has limits,” he added. In the capital, Dhaka, access to internet on mobile devices has been suspended. Deaths and injuries have been reported across the country, including the northern districts of Bogra, Pabna and Rangpur. Thousands of people gathered in a main square in Dhaka and there have been violent incidents in other parts of the city. “The whole city has turned into a battleground,” a policeman, who asked not to be named, told the AFP news agency. He said a crowd of several thousand protesters had set fire to cars and motorcycles outside a hospital. Asif Mahmud, a leading figure in the nationwide civil disobedience campaign, called on protesters to march on Dhaka on Monday. ""The time has come for the final protest"", he said. Students Against Discrimination, a group behind the anti-government demonstrations, urged people not to pay taxes or any utility bills. The students have also called for a shutdown of all factories and public transport. Around 10,000 people have been reportedly detained in a major crackdown by security forces in the past two weeks. Those arrested included opposition supporters and students. Some ex-military personnel have expressed support for the student movement, including ex-army chief General Karim Bhuiyan, who told journalists: “We call on the incumbent government to withdraw the armed forces from the street immediately. He and other ex-military personnel condemned ""egregious killings, torture, disappearances and mass arrests"". The next few days are seen as crucial for both camps. The protests pose a momentous challenge to Ms Hasina, who was elected for a fourth consecutive term in January elections, boycotted by the main opposition. Students took to the streets last month over a quota that reserved one third of civil service jobs for relatives of the veterans of Bangladesh’s independence war with Pakistan in 1971. Most of the quota has now been scaled back by the government following a government ruling, but students have continued to protest, demanding justice for those killed and injured. Now they want Ms Hasina to step down. Supporters of Ms Hasina have ruled out her resignation. Earlier, Ms Hasina offered unconditional dialogue with the student leaders, saying she wanted the violence to end. “I want to sit with the agitating students of the movement and listen to them. I want no conflict,"" she said. But the student protesters have rejected her offer. Ms Hasina called in the military last month to restore order after several police stations and state buildings were set on fire during the protests. The Bangladeshi army chief, Gen Waker-Uz-Zaman, held a meeting with junior officers in Dhaka to assess the security situation. “The Bangladesh army has always stood by the people and will continue to do so for the interest of people and in any need of the state,"" Gen Zaman said, according to a release by the Inter Services Public Relation Directorate. Bangladeshi media say most of those killed in last month’s protests were shot dead by police. Thousands were injured. The government argues that police opened fire only in self-defence and to protect state properties. More than 200 people have been killed in recent weeks after a crackdown on demonstrations. Aminan Rahman, 46, attacked Suma Begum, 24, during a video call with her boyfriend last April A UN expert describes the violence seen in videos analysed by the BBC as ""unlawful"". They were being treated for injuries they say were sustained after police tortured them in detention. Many said she did not appear to express the same level of sympathy towards those who had died.

2,2024-08-05 07:36:42.000,BBC News,2024-08-05 05:36:32.000,Ukraine receives first F-16 fighter jets - Zelensky,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ng1p72wlwo,2024-08-04 15:38:11.000,"Ukraine has received its first American-made F-16 fighter jets, President Volodymyr Zelensky has said. ""F-16s in Ukraine. We did it,"" President Zelensky said at a ceremony at an unnamed airbase, flanked by two of the planes. Ukraine’s leader thanked allies for what they were once very hesitant to provide - though he added that many more were needed. The arrival of the jets marks a crucial milestone in boosting the capabilities of Ukraine's air force, which largely relies on old Soviet-era jets. More F-16s are expected and hoped in the months ahead, though Mr Zelensky admitted that Ukraine does not yet have enough trained pilots to fly them all. He did not specify how many aircraft had arrived in Ukraine - or whether they had all been sent by Denmark, the Netherlands and the US, which he specifically thanked. Around 65 F-16s have been pledged by Nato countries since US President Joe Biden first authorised willing European allies to send them to Ukraine in August 2023. The F-16 was introduced in 1978. Many Western militaries are in the process of retiring the ageing fighters, replacing them with the US-made F-35, introduced in 2015. The UK does not have any F-16s in its air force, though it is supplying long-range Storm Shadow missiles which can be fitted to the jets. Ukraine's F-16s will work alongside a limited number of Western-supplied surface-to-air missile systems such as Patriot and Nasams which are already on the ground. With their capacity to carry rockets, bombs and missiles, F-16s should in theory allow the air force to carry out more strikes deep inside occupied territory, and possibly on targets close to the border inside Russia. They may also help defend against Russian glide bombs - dumb munitions fitted with pop-out wing kits and guidance modules to deliver precision strike stand-off capabilities, similar to the JDAM munitions from the United States. Around 3,000 were dropped in March alone, mostly from Su-34 fighter-bombers. If Ukraine can protect its F-16s on the ground, the hope is that they could play an important part in pushing back Russian aircraft to a point where they can no longer target Ukrainian ground forces with glide bombs. Kyiv had suggested that it could keep some F-16s at foreign military bases, but that suggestion prompted President Vladimir Putin to warn that any Western bases storing Ukrainian jets would be a legitimate military target for Russia. Experts also say the fighters could provide much needed air support to Ukrainian ground forces, who have faced relentless attacks in recent months, especially in the eastern Donbas region. Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov previously vowed that Western-made F-16s flying for Ukraine would be ""shot down"". ""But of course, these deliveries will not have any significant impact on the development of events on the front,"" he added. Kyiv has been accused of helping plan an ambush on Malian soldiers and the Russian mercenaries fighting alongside them. The Ukrainian military says it repelled one of the war's largest aerial assaults yet overnight. ""We are here and really happy to be here,"" scout leader Antonia Prudko says. Vehicles donated through London's Ulez scrappage scheme are making the four-day journey to Ukraine. Russia intends to destroy dozens of US-built warplanes as soon as they arrive in Ukraine.

2,2024-08-05 07:36:42.000,BBC News,2024-08-05 05:36:32.000,Mali cuts diplomatic ties with Ukraine over Wagner ambush claims,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceqdd7vdwg7o,2024-08-05 01:48:49.000,"Mali says it has cut diplomatic relations with Ukraine, after a military official suggested Kyiv had played a role in deadly fighting near the Algerian border last month. Dozens of Malian soldiers and mercenaries from Russia's Wagner group were killed in days of clashes with Tuareg separatist rebels and fighters linked to al-Qaeda. Andriy Yusov, a spokesman for Ukrainian military intelligence, said last week that the rebels had been given the ""necessary information"" to conduct the attacks. A top Malian official, Colonel Abdoulaye Maiga, said his government was shocked to hear the claim and accused Ukraine of violating Mali's sovereignty. Yusov's comments ""admitted Ukraine's involvement in a cowardly, treacherous and barbaric attack by armed terrorist groups"" that had led to the deaths of Malian soldiers, Col Maiga's statement said. Mali has decided to break off relations ""with immediate effect"", he said. Last week, Mali's army admitted it had suffered “significant” losses during several days of fighting earlier that erupted on 25 July. The clashes took place in the desert near Tinzaouaten, a north-eastern town on the border with Algeria. Reports say the Malian and Russian forcers were ambushed by Tuareg rebels and fighters from al-Qaeda affiliate Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin while waiting for reinforcements, after retreating from Tinzaouaten. Neither Mali’s military nor Wagner - which has since morphed into a group called the Africa Corps - have given exact figures, but the estimated death toll for Wagner fighters ranges from 20 to 80. The Russian mercenary outfit's losses are thought to be the heaviest it has suffered in Mali since it began helping the military government fight the insurgents two years ago. Wagner has acknowledged that one of its commanders was killed and a Russian helicopter was downed in ""fierce fighting"", saying they had been attacked by around 1,000 fighters. Tuareg-led separatists claimed on Thursday they had killed 84 Wagner mercenaries and 47 Malian soldiers. More than a decade ago, Mali's central government lost control of much of the north following a Tuareg rebellion, which was sparked by a demand for a separate state. The country's security was then further complicated by the involvement of Islamist militants in the conflict. When seizing power in coups in 2020 and 2021, the military cited the government's inability to tackle this unrest. The new junta severed Mali's long-running alliance with former colonial power France in favour of Russia, in a bid to quell the unrest. The arrival marks a crucial milestone in boosting the capabilities of Ukraine's air force, which largely relies on old Soviet-era jets. Ukraine's military said it destroyed the Rostov-on-Don attack submarine in a missiles attack on Friday. The Ukrainian military says it repelled one of the war's largest aerial assaults yet overnight. ""We are here and really happy to be here,"" scout leader Antonia Prudko says. Vehicles donated through London's Ulez scrappage scheme are making the four-day journey to Ukraine. Copyright 2024 BBC.

2,2024-08-05 07:36:42.000,BBC News,2024-08-05 05:36:32.000,'Betrayal': Detained US teacher's sister upset Russia prisoner swap left him out,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd100r3e7rko,2024-08-04 19:40:01.000,"The sister of Marc Fogel, an American teacher imprisoned in Russia for illegal possession of cannabis, told the BBC that she wishes her brother was among those freed during the historic US-Russia prisoner swap earlier this week. Mr Fogel, 63, was arrested at an airport in August 2021 and charged with carrying a small amount of medical marijuana, which had been prescribed in the US. The native of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was a teacher at the Anglo-American School of Moscow. While serving out his 14-year prison sentence, Mr Fogel has reportedly been teaching English to fellow inmates. Anne Fogel said she last spoke to her brother on Wednesday, when their family undertook a ""massive effort"" to get him on the plane with the other freed US prisoners. Reporter Evan Gershkovich, former US Marine Paul Wheelan and journalist Alsu Kurmasheva were taken to the US after they were released in the largest prisoner swap between Russia and the West since the Cold War. Anne Fogel detailed the family's effort in an interview with the BBC: ""We were frantically calling senators and congressmen and our ambassadors, former Russian ambassadors who served there, and I had no news for him, even though he knew that something was happening."" Anne said her brother may have been aware a prisoner swap was taking place because ""they play news nonstop in the Russian penal colonies"". ""He knew that something was going on, because... Paul Whelan had been moved and Evan (Gershkovich) had been moved."" After learning her brother was not part of the swap, she said she felt ""betrayal"". US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said on Thursday, the day of the prisoner swap, that the US was still ""actively working to get his (Mark Fogel's) release"". When asked about the American's case the following day, President Biden said that ""we're not giving up on that"". Asked whether that gave her hope, Anne said: ""I'm playing to whatever hope I can so yes, to a certain degree. ""The administration pulled off a masterful, incredible swap and they should be congratulated... and I'm very happy for the return of Paul and Evan and Alsu. ""I just wished my brother was among them."" Anne said her message to the White House was: ""Please, please do everything you can to get him out. He's the oldest one there, and he's the most infirm. Please help us."" White House National Security Council deputy adviser, Jonathan Finer, said on CBS' Face the Nation on Sunday that ""we worked to try to get Marc included in the deal that consummated last week"". ""And we are right back at it to try to get Marc back to the United States and unite (him) with his family."" He said that officials work on Mr Fogel's case ""every single day"". Mr Finer declined to predict whether the American might be returned by the end of the Biden administration in January.

2,2024-08-05 07:36:42.000,BBC News,2024-08-05 05:36:32.000,RFK Jr admits to dumping bear carcass in New York's Central Park,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2j3353vvdvo,2024-08-05 01:14:07.000,"Independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr has posted a video on social media in which he admits that he dumped a dead bear cub in New York City's Central Park in 2014. The clip, posted to his X account on Sunday, shows him with controversial US comedian Roseanne Barr as he describes bizarre circumstances that led to an incident that mystified New Yorkers 10 years ago. Mr Kennedy said a woman had hit and killed the bear with her car when he was driving behind her outside of the city, and he put it in his van with the intention of skinning the animal and harvesting its meat. It appears he shared the anecdote to get ahead of an upcoming story in The New Yorker magazine. The Kennedy campaign and the New Yorker did not respond to requests for comment. Seated with rolled-up sleeves at a table covered with food, Mr Kennedy tells Ms Barr in the video that he was driving to meet a group of people to go falconing near Goshen, New York, 10 years ago when the bear was killed. He says he pulled over to put the bear in his vehicle. ""I was going to skin the bear - and it was in very good condition - and I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator,"" he says. ""And you can do that in New York state: Get a bear tag for a roadkill bear."" New York state does allow people to take bears killed on roads, but the law stipulates that a person has to notify law enforcement or the state's Department of Environmental Conservation to acquire such a tag. Mr Kennedy does not appear to have done that. Instead, he says he continued to his falconing venture, which went late into the evening. He says he went on to a dinner reservation he had at Peter Luger Steakhouse in New York City, about 75 miles (121km) south of Goshen. ""At the end of the dinner, it was late and I realised I couldn't go home,"" Mr Kennedy says. ""I had to go to the airport, and the bear was in my car, and I didn't want to leave the bear in my car because that would have been bad."" That is when, he says, it occurred to him that there had been a series of bicycle accidents in New York and that he had an old bicycle in his car. He tells Ms Barr that he had the idea of staging a bike accident with the bear carcass in Central Park, which several drunk people with him heartily endorsed. He emphasises that he had not been drinking. ""So we did that and we thought it would be amusing for whoever found it or something,"" he says. ""The next day... it was on every television station. It was a front page of every paper and I turned on the TV and there was like a mile of yellow tape and 20 cop cars, there were helicopters flying, and I was like, 'Oh my god. What did I do?'"" He then notes that a factchecker from The New Yorker had called him and asked whether he was involved in dumping the bear's body, which appears to have prompted him to release this video. The bear's corpse was discovered by a woman walking her dog in the famous New York City park where bears are an unusual sight, according to a 2014 story written by the New York Times. It had been placed under some bushes and an abandoned bicycle, the story says. The paper noted, at the time, that the New York Police Department's Animal Cruelty Investigation Squad was looking into the bear's death, and the New York Department of Environmental Conservation had concluded that the animal had been killed in a ""motor vehicle collision"" - not a bike accident. The New York Police Department and Department of Environmental Conservation did not respond to requests for comment. The New York Times story notes how puzzling the 2014 incident was to those who followed the case: ""But so many questions remain unanswered: How did the bear end up in Central Park? Was there foul play involved? Did she die in the park, or was she dumped there?"" In a twist, that decade-old newspaper story was coincidentally written by another member of the famous Kennedy family - Tatiana Schlossberg, a former New York Times journalist who is the granddaughter of US President John F Kennedy. Ms Schlossberg did not immediately respond to a request for comment about her relative, though many members of the Kennedy family have disavowed Mr Kennedy's actions and his campaign for president. Mr Kennedy's bizarre confession comes as his 2024 campaign for president appears to be struggling. With Vice-President Kamala Harris entering the race after President Joe Biden announced his decision to step aside, polls indicate that Mr Kennedy's support has dwindled to the single digits. A scion of America's most famous political family, Mr Kennedy has struggled to raise money and slowed his campaigning in recent weeks. Those issues have coincided with a series of blunders that have fuelled speculation that the US politician might drop out, though he has insisted that he will not exit the race. Marc Fogel, 63, is serving a 14-year prison sentence in Russia and was excluded from the prisoner swap. Police officers in Texas jumped into action when they received an unusual call. Strong gusts of wind lifted the inflatable up to 20 feet (6m) from the ground during a baseball game on Friday.

2,2024-08-05 07:36:42.000,BBC News,2024-08-05 05:36:32.000,Casualties after third Israeli strike on school in a week,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9x88jpw05lo,2024-08-04 18:29:54.000,"Dozens of people have reportedly been killed in Israeli air strikes on two schools in Gaza, according to Palestinian rescuers and news outlets. Some of those killed were displaced people sheltering at the schools, rescuers said. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed the strikes, saying it had targeted Hamas ""command and control centres"" within two schools in Gaza City. The strikes were the third time in a week schools in Gaza have been hit by Israeli strikes. The IDF said: ""The schools were used by Hamas's al-Furqan Battalion as a hiding place for its terrorist operatives and as command centres used to plan and execute attacks against IDF troops and the state of Israel."" Footage on social media purported to show bodies inside one of the schools as rescuers evacuated casualties, including children. Palestinian media said at least 30 people were killed in the strikes. Mahmoud Basal, a spokesman for the Palestinian Civil Defence, said most of the dead were women and children. He added that more people were believed to be buried under the rubble. The attack on the al-Nasr and Hassan Salama schools came on the day of an attack on a camp for displaced people in a hospital in central Gaza, which reportedly killed at least five people. On Saturday, officials said an air strike on Hamama School in Gaza City had killed at least 17 people. Days earlier, a strike on Dalal al-Mughrabi School killed 15, according to officials. The IDF says it takes care to minimise risk to civilians when conducting strikes but the Palestinian Civil Defence described Sunday's attacks as ""a massacre"". In a separate development on Sunday morning, two people were killed in a stabbing attack in the Israeli city of Holon. The Palestinian attacker was later shot dead, police said. The Israel-Gaza war began on 7 October, when Hamas carried out an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. The attack triggered a massive Israeli military response, which has killed at least 39,480 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Western media reports suggest Israel's secret service planted bombs inside the building Ismail Haniyeh was staying in. A young woman's sporadic messages to the BBC's Paul Adams give unique insight into life in Gaza. Israel said Ismail al-Ghoul took part in the 7 October attack, but Al Jazeera said that was a lie. Ismail Haniyeh’s burial caps a week of soaring tensions in the Middle East. The US president made the criticism in his first comments on the apparent Israeli assassination. Copyright 2024 BBC.

British shooter Amber Rutter took silver in the women's skeet final after a controversial call in the shoot-off. Tommy Fleetwood also came up just short in the men's golf, finishing with silver behind US world number one Scottie Scheffler. Serbia's Novak Djokovic finally won the Olympic gold medal he had craved in the men's tennis to secure the 'Golden Slam'. Great Britain won their fifth equestrian medal of the Games as Lottie Fry, who has already helped GB win team dressage bronze, followed that with another bronze in the individual event on Sunday. In the gymnastics, Harry Hepworth became the first British man to win an Olympic vault medal with bronze but reigning world and European vault champion Jake Jarman finished fourth. The athletics heats continued, with Dina Asher-Smith bouncing back from her early exit in the women's 100m to progress in the 200m alongside team-mates Daryll Neita and Bianca Williams. Keely Hodgkinson progressed to the women's 800m final while both Josh Kerr and Neil Gourley eased into the final of the men's 1500m. There was, however, penalty shootout disappointment for GB in the men's hockey as they exited at the quarter-final stage, beaten by 10-man India. At La Defense Arena, Adam Peaty questioned China's relay victory on the final night of swimming in Paris, saying ""there's no point winning if you're not winning fair"".

It took a spectacular fightback from showman Lyles - who was seventh at the halfway stage- to overhaul his rivals and triumph in a personal best 9.79 seconds. Olympic debutant Thompson was awarded the same time, but had to settle for silver by the finest of margins. It means the American had a successful beginning to his bid for a potential four gold-medal haul at these Games, with the 200m and relay events still to come. The 27-year-old - an athlete who thrives on the sport's grandest stages - won three golds at last year's World Championships. The USA's former world champion Fred Kerley took bronze in 9.81, edging out South Africa's Akani Simbine for the podium. France 100m relay swimming team win silver Olympic hosts France have broken their record for medals at a single Games. On Sunday they clinched their 44th medal courtesy of a bronze in the men's foil fencing team finals. After just nine days in Paris, the host nation are already doing better than their previous benchmark for a modern Olympics of 43 at the Beijing Games in 2008. France won more than 100 medals at the 1900 Paris Games but that was contested over five months and their delegation represented almost half of the 1,000 participants, while some events were not sporting. There have been plenty of highlights for the country, from Shirine Boukli winning their first medal with a bronze in the judo to swimming sensation Leon Marchand taking four golds and a bronze in the pool. They currently sit third in the medal table with 12 golds, 14 silvers and 18 bronze and have seven more days of events to add to that.

In an exciting final round that saw the lead change a number of times, Fleetwood was tied with Scheffler on 19 under walking on to the 17th hole. But a bogey after missing the green and over-hitting a chip left him trailing Scheffler going down the last. The 33-year-old Englishman also misjudged an approach on the 18th as he attacked and had to settle for a par which secured the silver medal in his second Olympic games. Japan's Hideki Matsuyama took bronze on 17 under while Rory McIlroy, representing Ireland, finished in a tie for fifth on 15 under.

The 37-year-old Serb, who has won a men's record 24 majors and swept up every title there is in tennis, finally clinched Olympic gold at his fifth Games. In what was arguably his best performance of the year, he beat French Open and Wimbledon champion Alcaraz 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-2) in front of a packed crowd at Roland Garros. Djokovic was visibly emotional, immediately bursting into tears and falling to his knees in the middle of the court after hugging the Spaniard at the end of the match. He won singles bronze in Beijing in 2008, finished fourth at London 2012, suffered an emotional early loss in Rio in 2016 and lost the bronze-medal match in Tokyo three years ago. Djokovic becomes just the fifth player to win the 'Golden Slam' in singles - all four majors and the Olympic title - after Rafael Nadal, Serena Williams, Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf.

The 26-year-old finished in a tie of 55 shots out of 60 targets with Chile's Francisca Crovetto Chadid. They went to a shoot-off and were still tied after three rounds but, in a moment of contention, Rutter was called to have missed a shot which slow motion replays appeared to show she hit. She contested the call but shooting's version of a video assistant referee (VAR) or Hawkeye is not in use at the Olympics and the judges did not overturn the decision. Crovetto Chadid, 34, struck with both her next shots to make history and clinch her country's first ever shooting gold medal. Former world champion Rutter takes a medal, though, just over three months after giving birth to her first child, Tommy, on 25 April and was surprised by her husband at the end, who had brought their son to the final.

2,2024-08-05 07:36:42.000,BBC News,2024-08-05 05:36:32.000,Asia markets plunge after global rout last week,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6p224j24x0o,2024-08-05 05:36:04.000,"Stock markets in Asia plunged on Monday, following big falls last week by major indexes around the world. In Japan, the Topix index fell by more than 10%, while the Nikkei 225 was over 9% lower in afternoon trade. It comes after weak jobs data in the US on Friday sparked fears of a recession in the world's largest economy. Meanwhile, the yen has been strengthening against the US dollar since the Bank of Japan raised interest rates last week, making stocks in Tokyo more expensive for foreign investors. ""The selloff was instigated by the sharp appreciation of the [yen] as global investors turned cautious on Japanese corporate earnings, especially that of exporters such as automakers,"" said Kei Okamura, a Tokyo-based portfolio manager at investment firm Neuberger Berman. The Japanese currency has strengthened around 9% against the US dollar over the last month. A stronger yen makes Japanese goods more expensive, and consequently less attractive for potential overseas buyers. Elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, Taiwan’s main share index was down by 8.4%, while South Korea's Kospi fell 7.6%. India's main index the NSE Nifty 50 was trading1.8% lower and the ASX in Australia was down about 2%. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong was down 1.4%, while the Shanghai Stock Exchange was little changed. Cryptocurrencies were also down. Bitcoin dropped to just over $53,000, its lowest level since February. On Friday, stocks in New York fell sharply after official jobs data showed that US employers added 114,000 jobs in July, far fewer than expected. The figures raised concerns that a long-running jobs boom in the US might be coming to an end and drove speculation about when and by how much the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. Stock markets were already worried about high borrowing costs and unsettled by signs that a long-running rally in share prices, fuelled in part by optimism over artificial intelligence (AI), might be running out steam. Friday's decline in the Nasdaq brought the index down about 10% from its most recent peak - a fall known as a “correction” - that in this case has happened in a matter of weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also dropped 1.5% on Friday, and the S&P 500 ended 1.8% lower, after markets in Asia and Europe sank. Montreal is planning to allow bars and clubs to stay open all night, but opinions are mixed. The protests, which began as a student movement against job quotas, have spiralled into nationwide unrest. The figure was released as students returned to the streets demanding justice for those killed. The highest-ranking defector to escape North Korea in years, Ri Il Kyu has met Kim Jong Un seven times.

2,2024-08-05 07:36:42.000,BBC News,2024-08-05 05:36:32.000,Top vice-presidential contenders interviewed by Kamala Harris,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyx559kvvnyo,2024-08-04 17:04:36.000,"Vice-President Kamala Harris has interviewed potential contenders to be her running mate on Sunday, ahead of a battleground tour next week. Among those who travelled to Washington, DC, to meet Ms Harris were Governor Josh Shapiro, Senator Mark Kelly and Governor Tim Walz. The choices for the Democratic vice-president had been narrowed to a group of five, according to CBS, the BBC's US partner. A decision is required before the Democratic National Convention, which starts on 19 August in Chicago. It is unclear whether other potential candidates, including Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear or Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, were scheduled to meet with Ms Harris. Harris officially became the Democratic presidential nominee on Friday in a vote of party delegates. Once Ms Harris's running mate is announced, the two are expected to tour the battleground states. Mr Shapiro has seen high approval ratings since he was elected in 2022 and could help Ms Harris capture Pennsylvania - a must-win state in the race for the White House. Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, a former Navy pilot and Nasa astronaut, has become a leading voices on gun safety and his strong border stance and occasional criticisms of the Biden administration could help appeal to independent and conservative voters. Mr Walz, who served 12 years in Congress before becoming governor of Minnesota in 2019, gained national attention for his strategy calling Donald Trump and JD Vance ""weird"". On Friday President Joe Biden said he had spoken to Ms Harris about her search for a running mate. Asked what qualities she should look for in a vice-presidential candidate, he said: “I’ll let her work that out."" Potential partners to join Ms Harris on the Democratic ticket for November's election face an exhaustive vetting process, having to answer up to 200 questions before being seriously considered.  Delegates do not vote on the vice-presidential pick. The United Automobile Workers, a major US union representing more than 400,000 people, said its preferred vice-presidential pick was Mr Beshear, who “stood with us on the picket line and has been there for workers”. Speaking to CBS' Face the Nation, UAW President Shawn Fain added that Mr Walz was also “100% behind labour”, but he criticised Mr Shapiro’s support of private school vouchers in Pennsylvania - a Republican-backed proposal to send $100m to families for private school tuition and school supplies. While she holds those meetings, a new by CBS News, BBC's US partner, suggests Ms Harris holds a slight edge over her Republican rival Donald Trump, leading by one point nationally. Across battleground states, the poll indicates that the pair are neck-and neck. Trump still enjoys a small lead in a few states - Wisconsin, Georgia and North Carolina - but the race has tightened significantly since Mr Biden bowed out of the race and Ms Harris became the Democratic nominee. The poll suggests that the vice-president has energised the Democratic base, with young, black and female voters noting their renewed enthusiasm for the presidential election. Meanwhile, Trump's campaign is still beset by comments he made at a convention for US-based black journalists in which he questioned Ms Harris' racial identity. Trump said of Ms Harris: ""I didn't know she was black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn black and now she wants to be known as black. So I don't know - Is she Indian? Or is she black?"" Ms Harris' mother was born in India and her father is from Jamaica. She has always identified as both Indian American and black. Multiple Trump allies appeared on US politics shows on Sunday in an attempt to shift attention from what he said. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a longtime Trump backer, said he would advise the former president to focus on the Biden-Harris administration's policy decision - not the vice-president's heritage. “Every day we’re talking about her heritage and not her terrible, dangerous liberal record throughout her entire political life [is] a good day for her and a bad day for us,"" Mr Graham told Fox News Sunday. Earlier in the day, Senator Laphonza Butler, a Democrat who represents Ms Harris' home state of California, called the comments about the vice-president's race ""despicable"" and ""an insult"" during an appearance on CNN. ""This is a woman who was born in Oakland, California, who has declared and lived proudly all of her identities her entire life, embracing the totality of who she is,” she said. “This is the only card he’s (Trump’s) got to play, and so he's playing it. He’s desperate.” Presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr says the 2014 incident that mystified New Yorkers was a prank. With no woman having served as president, the state run by women could offer pointers for a route to the White House. The president is using his final months in office to take a victory lap after weeks of personal and political turmoil. The vice-president has a shortlist of five possible running mates, according to US media. The Republican suggested Vice-President Kamala Harris changed her identity from Indian and ""became black"".

2,2024-08-05 07:36:42.000,BBC News,2024-08-05 05:36:32.000,North Korea performs diplomatic gymnastics in Olympic comeback,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crgkk0rle75o,2024-08-04 08:08:04.000,"As the Paris gymnastics arena roared on American Simone Biles for her third gold medal of the 2024 Olympics, one of those applauding was none other than An Chang-ok, a rival from North Korea. Saturday’s women’s vault final saw the North share a stage with its foes South Korea and the US. An, 21, grinned and waved for TV cameras and hugged at least one fellow finalist - rare interactions with foreigners by a young woman required to perform diplomatic gymnastics while being carefully chaperoned on her trip away from home. Pyongyang’s decision to send athletes to these Games – two of whom even posed for a selfie with rivals from the South - has raised hopes that the secretive state could be partially reopening after a particularly deep period of isolation. After all, this comes after a heated period that has seen the North sending waste-filled balloons at the South. The North’s participation in these Games signalled a “remarkable” return to the international fold, suggested Jean H Lee, a former Associated Press journalist who opened the US news agency’s first bureau in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang. It did not send any athletes to the Tokyo Olympics, held in 2021, after the country shut itself off from the world even more sternly than usual due to the Covid-19 pandemic. But in Paris, it was “making the effort to rejoin the international community”, Lee said, “regardless of what’s happening with their nuclear programme, which is always the elephant in the room”. The North’s nuclear ambitions are an enduring cause of tension with the South and the US. But there was no sign of animosity between the three nations’ gymnasts on Saturday. This new generation of North Korean athletes have claimed two silvers in Paris, and occasionally surprised sport commentators who did not know what to expect from them. Winning medals was not the country's only aim, according to Prof Ramon Pacheco Pardo of King’s College London, who has written extensively on the two Koreas. The age-old North Korean art of “sports diplomacy” involved limited participation in a global forum to prove the country was normal, Prod Pacheco Pardo said. Athletes were some of the “few actors that North Korea has who won’t be viewed suspiciously” by the world, he explained. The contrasting support for An and Biles could not have been starker. In an earlier competition during the Games in Paris, Biles was memorably cheered on by a host of celebrity supporters in the stands, including Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande, Tom Cruise and Snoop Dogg. Thousands of punters yelled her name on Saturday, too. An, meanwhile, received only polite appreciation from the neutrals. She had no compatriots in the room, since ordinary North Koreans are prevented from leaving their country. It is unlikely that anyone was watching at home, either, as the Games are not being televised live in North Korea, according to Radio Free Asia (RFA). And BBC Monitoring has only been able to find a handful of text reports in the tightly-controlled state media. Nonetheless, “the chattering class of Pyongyang certainly will, from one source or another” know the Olympic results as they come in, said John Everard, the UK’s ambassador to North Korea from 2006 to 2008. An is among 16 North Korean who athletes have come to an opulent host city that could hardly be more different to the austere Pyongyang airport in which they were filmed setting off last month. Top North Korean athletes were likely to have some awareness of the outside world, said Everard, but there was still likely to be a “shock factor”. One of the viral moments of the Games so far was a rare encounter that seemed to break the boundaries: when a bronze-winning South Korean table-tennis player took a selfie that showed his mixed-doubles partner posing alongside the silver-winning North Korean duo. Would the leadership in Pyongyang have anticipated – or relished – this brief symbol of unity between two nations who are still technically at war? Agreeing to the selfie was “a message” from the North, said Prof Pachedo Pardo, who speculated that the move would have had Pyongyang’s consent. “North Korea is indicating that it doesn’t have a problem with South Korean people - that the issue it has is with the South Korean government.” At any rate, the moment was not totally unexpected, after something similar in 2016. And two years later, North and South fielded a joint women’s ice hockey team at the Winter Games in the South. The selfie represents one of the North’s few visible interactions with the outside world during the Games, including a perfunctory press conference by the two table-tennis stars. Away from the stadiums, unverified footage has appeared to show An holding a collection of pin-badges, which are reported to be an item popularly traded by international gymnasts. After so much exposure to the Western world, the athletes will probably undergo a gruelling “debrief” after returning home to ensure they stay on-message, said Lee, who is also the co-host of the BBC World Service’s Lazarus Heist podcast. Contrary to the myth, any athlete deemed to have “failed” would probably not be punished, the analysts agreed. But they could face gruelling “self-criticism” sessions. “The big hit for not winning a medal isn’t so much the punishment, it’s that you don’t gain all the benefits that you could have gained,” said Everard. Victorious athletes may be given higher status in society and even prizes such as a new home. It remains to be seen whether this latest sporting diplomacy will translate into meaningful new talks between the two Koreas. The relative bonhomie in Paris was briefly imperilled at the outset by a furore when organisers mixed up the two nations’ names in the opening ceremony, for which they apologised. Outside the Bercy Arena after Saturday’s gymnastics, one fan from the Seoul side was not convinced the politics would change much. But she said the sight of sportspeople sharing a stage was at least a reminder that all Koreans were united by something “human”. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

2,2024-08-05 07:36:42.000,BBC News,2024-08-05 05:36:32.000,‘Marchand-mania’ inspires French unity – but for how long?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8800jvx0mno,2024-08-04 17:38:34.000,"Swimming sensation Léon Marchand appears to have inspired a little of the French ideal of ""fraternité"" that may have felt in short supply in the host nation during a time of sharp recent political division. He was again cheered on by a home crowd in Sunday's 4 x 100m medley relay, in which he and his teammates won bronze after briefly leading the contest. The 22-year-old has won four golds at the Games - more than any other French competitor at a single Olympics - and has been compared with American legend Michael Phelps. More fanciful is an idea floated by political cartoonists and social media users, who joke that Marchand should be chosen as prime minister following last month's bitterly-contested snap election, in which a left-wing coalition ultimately prevailed over the far-right. The gags show that France is looking to “laud someone who seems so dedicated and sincere in his sport, and way of life”, explained Andrew Hussey, a historian of French culture, who added that many saw Marchand as representing a contrast to the country’s politicians. The athlete's heroics were proving a welcome distraction during the crisis, said Parisians lounging on the grass in one of the city’s parks, watching the sporting action on a big screen. “We don’t want to think about the problems,” said a woman named Thanh. “We don’t want to think about the division in the country.” The swimmer had helped to “smooth everything”. Louis agreed: “When Marchand was racing, it was the most important thing for the country for a while.” Politics seem to be largely on hold for the Games, after President Emmanuel Macron said negotiations over the formation of a new government would have to wait until after the Paralympics. Mr Macron is among those who have been to roar on Marchand in person. On Friday night, the arena was filled with deafening roars of “allez” (“go”) each time the golden boy’s swimming cap bobbed above water as he powered to glory in the 200m medley. But anyone seriously hoping that Marchand will stick his head above the political parapet looks likely to be disappointed. The swimmer, who trains in the US, has avoided wading into public debate. That contrasts with another national hero, football star Kylian Mbappé, who memorably used a Euro 2024 press conference to urge a vote against the far-right. The tradition of a population galvanising around a hero is as old as the Games itself, according to Philip Barker, the editor of the Journal of Olympic History. Some host nations' sporting heroes have inspired lasting change, Barker said. He cited Cathy Freeman, an Aboriginal runner who celebrated her 400m sprint win in Syndey in 2000 with the Australian and Aboriginal flags, as prompting an spirit of inclusivity from Australians towards the indigenous population ""that hadn't really existed before"". During the 2012 Games in London, Jessica Ennis-Hill, Greg Rutherford and Mo Farah were lionised after bagging a quick flurry of golds in what was quickly dubbed “super Saturday”. But the UK’s “golden era” of solidarity was fairly short-lived, Barker said, pointing to the political divisions that characterised the Scottish independence and Brexit referendums in the following years. One specialist in contemporary French politics agreed that the unifying effect of Marchand and his fellow French medallists was unlikely to last for long. “We can expect an immediate return to a fractured political field and a disgruntled electorate as soon as the Games are over,” said Emile Chabal, a professor of contemporary history at the University of Edinburgh. “No amount of Marchand-mania - and we've seen this before with great French sporting stars like [Zinedine] Zidane or Mbappé - will stop that,” he said. But for the last week, Marchand’s compatriots have been glued to his exploits – so much so that even those who have paid good money for Olympic tickets have spent some of those events watching his races on their phones. That applied to one Parisian in the fan park, Audrey, who admitted she had torn her eyes away from a volleyball match to witness Marchand claim one of his golds on her screen. Although France had found a new hero, it was possible that “maybe next week there will be another Marchand”, Audrey pointed out. And at any rate, Marchand was just a part of something bigger. “It’s not just about him,” she said, citing the “amazing” opening ceremony. France should be “very proud about what we are showing to the world” with the Olympics, she said.

2,2024-08-05 07:36:42.000,BBC News,2024-08-05 05:36:32.000,Calls for foreigners to leave Lebanon as war fears grow,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80xxeqel5po,2024-08-04 13:37:32.000,"Several countries have urged their nationals to leave Lebanon, as fears grow of a wider conflict in the Middle East. Iran has vowed “severe” retaliation against Israel, which it blames for the death of Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on Wednesday. Israel has not commented. His assassination came hours after Israel killed Hezbollah senior commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut. Western officials fear that Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militia and political movement based in Lebanon, could play a key role in any such retaliation, which in turn could spark a serious Israeli response. Diplomatic efforts by the US and other Western countries continue to try to de-escalate tensions across the region. A growing number of flights have been cancelled or suspended at the country’s only commercial airport in Beirut. The US, the UK, Australia, Sweden, France, Italy, Canada, South Korea, Saudi Arabia and Jordan are among the countries to have urged their citizens to leave Lebanon as soon as possible. Fears of an escalation of hostilities that could engulf Lebanon are at their highest since Hezbollah started its attacks on Israel, a day after the deadly Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October, in support for Palestinians in Gaza. Most of the violence has been contained to border areas, with both sides indicating not being interested in a wider conflict. Hezbollah, however, has vowed to respond to Shukr’s assassination, which happened in Dahiyeh, the group’s stronghold in Beirut’s southern suburbs. On Sunday, Hezbollah launched dozens of rockets at the town of Beit Hillel in northern Israel at around 00:25 local time (21:25 GMT Saturday). Footage posted on social media showed Israel's Iron Dome air defence system intercepting the rockets. There have been no reports of casualties. Israel’s air force responded by striking targets in southern Lebanon. In a separate development on Sunday morning, two people were killed in a stabbing attack in the Israeli city of Holon. The attacker was later “neutralised”, police said. Also on Sunday, officials from the Hamas-run ministry of health in Gaza said an Israeli air strike had hit a tent inside a hospital, killing at least five people. The officials said 19 Palestinians had been killed on Sunday. In a statement on Saturday, the US embassy in Beirut said those who chose to stay in Lebanon should “prepare contingency plans” and be prepared to “shelter in place for an extended period of time”. The Pentagon has said it is deploying additional warships and fighter jets to the region to help defend Israel from possible attacks by Iran and its proxies, a strategy similar to the one adopted in April, when Iran launched more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel in retaliation to an attack on its diplomatic compound in Syria. It blamed Israel for that strike. Many fear Iran’s retaliation on this occasion could take a similar form. The UK says it is sending extra military personnel, consular staff and border force officials to help with any evacuations. It has urged UK citizens to leave Lebanon while commercial flights are running. Two British military ships are already in the region and the Royal Air Force has put transport helicopters on standby. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the regional situation “could deteriorate rapidly”. In a phone call with EU Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell on Friday, Iran's Acting Foreign Minister Ali Baqeri Kani said Iran would ""undoubtedly use its inherent and legitimate right"" to ""punish"" Israel. On Friday, an announcer on Iran's state TV warned ""the world would witness extraordinary scenes"". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Israelis that ""challenging days lie ahead... We have heard threats from all sides. We are prepared for any scenario"". Tensions between Israel and Iran initially escalated with the killing of 12 children and teenagers in a strike on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Israel accused Hezbollah and vowed “severe” retaliation, though Hezbollah denied it was involved. Days later, Shukr, who was a close adviser to the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in a targeted Israeli air strike in Beirut. Four others, including two children, were also killed. Hours after that, Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Iran, Hamas's main backer. He was visiting to attend the inauguration of Iran's new president, Masoud Pezeshkian. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has said Israel will suffer a “harsh punishment” for the killing. Haniyeh's assassination dealt a blow to the negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza, the main hope to defuse tensions along the Lebanon-Israel border. The war began in October when Hamas carried out an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. The attack triggered a massive Israeli military response, which has killed at least 39,480 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Western media reports suggest Israel's secret service planted bombs inside the building Ismail Haniyeh was staying in. The killing of Hezbollah and Hamas leaders crossed ""red lines"", Hassan Nasrallah says, but he stops short of declaring all-out war. Iran has threatened “harsh punishment” for Israel, which it blames for Ismail Haniyeh's assassination in Tehran. Israel had accused Fuad Shukr, a top Hezbollah commanders, of masterminding operations against Israel. The Hamas leader was assassinated in Tehran, and it is widely believed Israel was behind the killing. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

2,2024-08-05 07:36:42.000,BBC News,2024-08-05 05:36:32.000,Nigerian president demands end to deadly protests,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crgeexzdl4wo,2024-08-04 13:37:00.000,"Nigerian President Bola Tinubu has appealed for protests to end after “bloodshed” during three days of demonstrations over a deepening cost of living crisis. At least seven people have died and more than 700 have been arrested since Nigerians nationwide rallied on Thursday for the first of 10 planned “days of rage”. “My dear Nigerians, especially our youth, I have heard you loud and clear,” the president said in a televised address, adding that he understood their “pain and frustration”. He went on to defend his economic reforms, which the protesters blame for their hardships since he came to office in May 2023, including skyrocketing prices. The president said the protests had been hijacked by looters in some areas, and ending the unrest would create room for dialogue. But Mr Tinubu did not indicate that he would reverse his policies, which include removing a petrol subsidy or ending the peg of the local currency to the dollar. The demonstrations were organised via social media using the hashtag #EndBadGovernance and inspired by the recent success of protesters in Kenya, who forced the government there to scrap plans to increase taxes. President Tinubu also expressed pain over the loss of lives in four northern states and the destruction of public facilities. Twenty-four-hour curfews remain in place in Borno, Jigawa, Kano and Yobe after authorities there accused “hoodlums” of violence. Mr Tinubu said “the wanton looting of supermarkets and shops” was contrary to the promise of protest organisers. The protests in Kano city drew the largest crowds on the first day, with police firing live bullets and tear gas to try and disperse thousands of demonstrators. Looting was also reported. “As a president of this country, I must ensure public order,” the 72-year-old president said in his speech on Sunday morning. “Our government will not stand idly by and allow a few with a clear political agenda to tear this nation apart.” Amnesty International has put the death toll at 13 nationwide and on Sunday called on Kano's governor to ""set up an independent judicial commission of inquiry to investigate the killing of at least 10 hunger protesters"". Some in Kano went on to ignore the lockdown order and a few of those that gathered in suburbs of the city on Friday and Saturday were filmed waving Russian flags and calling on Russia’s President Vladimir Putin for help. By Sunday this sentiment was being reflected on WhatsApp with protesters changing their profile photos on WhatsApp to the Russian flag, some with the words “Rasha Uwa”, which means “Russia our mother” in the Hausa language. Others are posting memes to Kano groups saying: “We Nigerians are dying of hunger and our leaders don’t care. Please President Putin of Russia come to our aid.” In the capital, Abuja, security forces fired tear gas for a third day on Saturday to stop protesters marching from a stadium - designated for them to gather - on the city centre. Businesses, which were closed during the first protests, began to reopen in Lagos and parts of Abuja on Friday. But flights to places like Kano from Lagos have been cancelled indefinitely. It is not clear if the president's address will be able to assuage the anger of young Nigerians - but first indications suggest not. Following the speech, a youth leader in the northern city of Kaduna posted on Facebook in Hausa: “Tomorrow everyone will come out with the Russian flags.” Abiodun Sanusi from the Take It Back Nigeria movement, one of the organisers of the protest, told the BBC. “We can't leave the streets until our demands are met.” He urged the president to allow protesters to march to the centre of Abuja and meet them there. “If the president wants to have a dialogue, we urge the president to meet with us at Eagle Square, in the presence of all Nigerians and live on television. “We are not interested in any secret meetings.” Mr Sanusi added that the protesters were unhappy about the threat from the defence chief on Friday that the military would ""act"" if violence continued. “Only the police should be on the streets, and they should be peaceful too.” The police have denied using excessive force during the demonstrations. Respected Nigerian security analyst Bulama Bukarti warned that the use of Russian flags was spreading and was “potentially dangerous”. “I urge protesters to be cautious and not allow themselves to be manipulated by forces of instability with their own sinister agendas,” he said on X. Following several coups in West Africa in recent years, Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger - Nigeria’s neighbour to the north - have left the regional bloc and welcomed Russian help in dealing with security issues.

2,2024-08-05 07:36:42.000,BBC News,2024-08-05 05:36:32.000,Belgium out of triathlon relay as athlete falls ill,https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/articles/cgerrl2w19ko,2024-08-04 17:56:30.000,"Claire Michel competed in triathlon for Belgium in Rio 2016 and Paris 2020 Belgium have pulled out of the Olympic mixed relay triathlon at Paris 2024 after one of their athletes fell ill. Claire Michel competed in the women's triathlon on Wednesday, finishing 38th. De Standaard, one of Belgium's biggest newspapers, is reporting that the 35-year-old has contracted E coli but BBC Sport has not been able to verify this claim. The poor water quality of the Seine had been a major talking point before and during Paris 2024. It caused the men's triathlon to be delayed by a day, while the practice swim for the mixed relay was postponed on Sunday for the second day in a row. The mixed relay race will take place on Monday morning as planned, despite a request from teams to delay the competition to allow for more athlete preparation time. A joint statement from World Triathlon and Paris 2024 said: ""The latest test results confirm that Seine water-quality levels at the triathlon venue have improved in recent hours, with forward-looking analysis indicating that water quality will be within the levels acceptable by World Triathlon."" On Saturday, the Swiss team said that their athlete Adrien Briffod - who took part in the men's race - had a stomach infection and would not compete in the mixed relay. The Belgian Olympic Committee (COIB) did not reveal what illness Michel was suffering from. COIB announced that the decision not to participate was taken ""in consultation with the athletes and the entourage"". It added that it hopes ""that lessons will be learned for future triathlon competitions"". Prior to the start of the Olympic triathlon event, tests were being carried out daily on the water quality in the Seine, which is also due to host the Olympic marathon swimming on 8 and 9 August, and the Para-triathlon event at the Paralympics, which start on 28 August. Swimming in the river had been banned for over 100 years because of high levels of pollution and the risk of disease, but French authorities have invested heavily to make the Seine swimmable as part of the Games' legacy. Organisers said about 1.4bn euros (£1.2bn) had been spent on a regeneration project to make the Seine safe. Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo recently swam in the river to highlight the clean-up efforts which have been undertaken and, earlier this month, tests showed the river was clean enough for swimming. However, heavy rain in Paris on the first Friday and Saturday of the Olympics caused the water quality to decline - although both the men's and women's individual races were able to take place on Wednesday. Team GB have selected Alex Yee - the men's gold medal winner - Georgia Taylor Brown, Sam Dickinson and women's bronze medallist Beth Potter for Monday's event, which can be pushed back to Tuesday if the water quality is not up to standard on Monday.

2,2024-08-05 07:36:42.000,BBC News,2024-08-05 05:36:32.000,Russian dissident Kara-Murza tells BBC he thought he would die in prison,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crg55g4z526o,2024-08-05 04:34:25.000,"“I was absolutely certain I would die in Putin’s prison.” It’s almost the first thing Vladimir Kara-Murza tells me after his surprise release in the biggest prisoner exchange since the Cold War. The Russian opposition politician is painfully thin – from stress, he says. He’s also still reeling from his abrupt transfer from a high security jail in Siberia into forced exile, after more than two years behind bars. “It’s surreal, like I’m watching a film,” he describes the feeling. “But it’s a good film,” in which he’s finally been reunited with the family he hasn’t seen since his arrest in Moscow in April 2022. His youngest son has been following him everywhere, anxious not to let him out of his sight. Vladimir Kara-Murza, who is also a British citizen, was convicted of treason and sentenced to 25 years for his fierce and persistent condemnation of Vladimir Putin and the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. He has spent the past 11 months straight in solitary confinement, made to fold away his bed each morning at 05:00 and only given paper and pen for an hour or so each day. “It’s so easy to lose your mind. You lose sense of time, space. Everything really,” he reveals, in one of his first long interviews since release. “You do nothing, speak to no one, go nowhere. Day after day after day.” He was denied phone calls home, only allowed to speak to his children twice in over two years. The added punishment was even tougher, physically. Almost a decade ago, Vladimir Kara-Murza nearly died from an unknown toxin and still suffers from after-effects, including nerve damage. In September, he now reveals, a prison doctor gave him ""a year, 18 months at best"" to live, if he stayed behind bars. “After two FSB poisonings, I don’t exactly have the right state of health for a strict regime prison,” he explains, with a wry smile. Last week, Kara-Murza was one of eight Russian dissidents who went missing from their prisons. As lawyers and relatives sounded the alarm, rumours of a looming swap began to swirl. The prisoners themselves had no idea. Instead, when guards burst into Kara-Murza’s cell in Omsk he thought he would be “led out to be shot”, he recalls. “I actually thought they were going to execute me.” He’d recently been instructed to sign a request for a presidential pardon but refused to beg for mercy from Vladimir Putin, who he denounces as “a dictator, usurper and a murderer”. Kara-Murza was transferred to Moscow and the notorious Lefortovo FSB jail. Five days later he was led out to board a bus and saw the other dissidents inside, each one with an FSB guard in a balaclava. Another guard then took the bus microphone and announced they were being taken for a prisoner swap, no details. “No-one asked our consent,” Kara-Murza says. “We were loaded onto a plane like cattle and flown out.” The activist landed in Germany in the only civilian clothes he owned: black long-johns and T-shirt, and the flip flops he used for the prison shower. The Russian dissidents were part of a ""bundle"" of political prisoners released, along with high-profile US nationals like the journalist Evan Gershkovich. Three were former activists from the team of Alexei Navalny, the opposition politician who died suddenly in prison earlier this year. Originally, Navalny was to be part of the complex swap. In return for the dissidents, Russia got a handful of spies and criminals including the key prize sought by Vladimir Putin: an FSB hitman known as Vadim Krasikov who’d murdered in broad daylight in a Berlin park. The judge sentencing him to life in prison had called the killing an act of ""state terrorism"". “To everyone who criticises this [swap], I would respectfully urge them not to think of prisoner exchanges but of saving lives,” Kara-Murza argues, in response to the controversy over freeing Krasikov. The killer was welcomed home to a red carpet and a hug from Putin himself. “Aren’t 16 lives worth releasing one murderer?” For a long time, Germany wasn’t sure. The delay, Kara-Murza argues, may be what cost Alexei Navalny his life. The joy of the Kara-Murzas’ reunion is marred by thoughts of the Russian detainees who were not released. “I’m so happy and overwhelmed to see these people free, but also very sad so many people were left behind,” his wife Evgenia tells me. “I feel guilty.” Memorial human rights organisation lists hundreds of political prisoners and she had been campaigning hard for a priority group. “There are people with serious medical conditions, like Alexei Gorinov who’s missing part of his lung, who don’t have a lot of time.” Her husband talks of those ""still languishing in Putin’s Gulag"" and the hope of further exchanges. He had only been free himself for five minutes, when he strayed into controversy. In statements made soon after landing in Germany, Vladimir Kara-Murza argued that sanctions in relation to the Ukraine war should be better targeted. There was immediate uproar from Ukrainians who claimed his priority on walking free was to soften Russia’s punishment for waging war. Kara-Murza calls it calibration. “I need more information,” he admits. “I realise that February 2022 changed a lot.” But he wants to know why a Russian human rights lawyer can’t travel to the Baltic states for a conference, when a Russian missile containing a Western-made chip can slam into a residential building in Ukraine. “The responsibility for what the Putin regime is doing there is shared by Russian society, a large part of which chose to close their eyes to the abuses and repression,” he argues. “But let’s not forget the responsibility of those Western countries who for years preferred to deal with Vladimir Putin and do business, knowing full well who he was and what he represented.” In 2022, Vladimir Kara-Murza was arrested because he insisted on being inside Russia and speaking out. Now he’s barred from travelling, he worries about his right to call others there to action. He thinks he’ll feel ""more constrained"". But he will continue condemning the war on Ukraine. “Putin can’t be allowed to win this war. Ukraine must win, and there should be more support from Western countries so that happens,” he argues. Historically, he says, ""windows of opportunity"" for democratic change open after ""disastrous military defeat"". When his plane out of Russia was taking off, the FSB guard next to Kara-Murza told him to look out of the window. “He said it was the last time I was seeing my motherland.” The activist laughed. “I said, I’m a historian, so I am sure I will be back in my country.” “And it will be much quicker than you think.” Marc Fogel, 63, is serving a 14-year prison sentence in Russia and was excluded from the prisoner swap.

2,2024-08-05 07:36:42.000,BBC News,2024-08-05 05:36:32.000,Can 24-hour drinking zones transform a city?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckdgqpy0lyeo,2024-08-04 23:01:46.000,"When Frank Sinatra sang about “a city that never sleeps”, he probably wasn’t thinking about the economic boost that busy nightlife can provide to a metropolis. Yet a growing number of cities around the world are increasingly homing in on ways to strengthen their night-time economy. Around 100 cities now have some form of “night mayor” or “night tsar” in place, to spur this work. But most of those cities, including London, Sydney, and Sinatra’s beloved New York, are not up all night. In other words, they don’t allow bars and nightclubs to remain open, and serve alcohol, 24 hours a day. Nonetheless, later this year, Montreal - Canada’s second-largest city - is planning to take the leap into 24-hour nightlife. Following in the footsteps of Berlin and Tokyo, venues in a new all-night district in Montreal's city centre will be licensed to remain open, and serve alcohol, throughout the night. City officials say the move will bring in hundreds of millions of dollars in additional revenue. Currently bars and clubs in the city have to close by 3am. On a warm Friday evening in July, the centre of Montreal is bustling; busy bars and restaurants line the wide, pedestrianised streets. “This is an opportunity for economic growth,” says Ericka Alneus, the city councilor behind the 24-hour plan. “But it’s also to present, and reinforce, the cultural scene.” In 2022, the annual financial value of Montreal’s nightlife was estimated to be worth C$2.25bn ($1.6bn; £1.3bn), according to advocacy group MTL 24/24. It says that from this, C$121m went in tax to the government. Clearly, Ms Alneus hopes those figures will increase when venues are allowed to stay open all night. But not everyone is supportive of the change: “We don’t have enough security for it,” says one concerned reveller. A fellow citizen is worried about the practical implications: “It’s nice for people who like to party, but the Metro closes at 1.30am,” she says. “There has to be some kind of way people can go back home.” Sergio Da Silva’s live music bar, Turbo Haus Club, is located on Saint Denis Street in Old Montreal. He says the planned changes haven’t been sufficiently considered. “You can't just say, 'here are some 24-hour bars, go nuts!'. ""There's no infrastructure to uphold it. There's no 24-hour public transport, there's no extra security. “Then, there’s the cost of living. If people can't afford to go out, no matter what 24-hour policy you put in, it doesn't change anything,” he adds. As the sun sets outside a different bar, L’ile Noir, owner Michelle Lavellee disagrees - he has a different take on the closing-time situation. “In Montreal, we close at 3am. People are drunk at 1am - and they're super-drunk at 3am. “One of the problems we have is, at 3am it's like madness. But if you expand the hours, there’s less problems, less demand for security,” he explains. Ms Alneus agrees. She says the fact that so many bars and clubs all currently close at 3am presents problems for the police. She believes by allowing 24-hour drinking, those venues that don’t wish to stay open all night will be able to close at different times across the night. She maintains staggering closing time will bring “a bit more safety in nightlife areas”. Back in 2012, the Dutch capital, Amsterdam, became the first city to appoint a night mayor - a role that went to club promoter and festival organiser Mirik Milan. He says that during his six years in charge, alcohol-related violence and reports of nuisance fell by 20% and 30% respectively. Those statistics, he says, were vital for local politicians to demonstrate to voters that “we really managed the night in a better way”. Mr Milan has gone on to co-found VibeLab, a nightlife consultancy advising governments around the world. He says that when a city embraces nightlife as one of its key cultural assets, it can have billions of dollars of positive impact on the local economy. “It drives tourism. It brings in a lot of creative operators and businesses that want to be located in that city. And that has a huge impact on the city as a whole."" Lutz Leichsenring, co-founder at VibeLab, has been instrumental in promoting nightlife as part of Berlin’s Clubcommission - the organisation which, since 2000, has represented approximately 280 nightclubs in the German capital. “One of the strongest arguments for nightlife is that it attracts talented and skilled workers,” he says. “It's just a very important factor why people would relocate to a city, or would like to stay in a city and not move away."" Mr Leichsenring adds that the increased temperatures brought about by climate change will only make the nighttime economy more important during summer months for many cities. He maintains everything “from construction, to education, and cultural gatherings” will increasingly move to cooler nighttime hours. “The night needs to be governed better, because the more you shift to that - to the night - the more conflicts you create, because people also want to sleep at night.” Meanwhile, efforts to transform cities into all-night zones have – in some cases - proved disappointing. In 2017, London Mayor Sadiq Khan announced his 24-hour city proposal, appointing US comedian Amy Lamé “to champion nightlife”. Both were criticised earlier this year after suggesting they had succeeded in their vision, with social media-users expressing their frustration with the hashtag 'LameLondon' on X. The work of Sydney’s night mayor has also faced scepticism. Sticking to a nightlife plan isn’t always easy, particularly when governments change, says Jess Reia, assistant professor of data science at the University of Virginia. “The challenge is how to keep good policies after administration change - instead of having a pilot project for a few years, and then ending up with nothing,” she says. Back in Montreal, there is no start date yet for 24-hour opening. Ms Alneus says the intention is to launch some time in the autumn. ""We are trying to be trailblazers, and to push forward something that everybody enjoys."" she says. ""There are venues, artists, initiatives and performances at night-time that should have the light on them - for the economic growth of the city, but also for the cultural identity of Montreal."" Japan's Topix stock index falls by more than 10% after shares around the world fell sharply last week. The two men were arrested and charged at a 2022 border blockade in Coutts, Alberta. The lawsuit alleges the multi-billionaire unfairly terminated a partnership with the celebrity presenter. A faulty update by the cyber-security firm last month caused chaos around the world. The two companies say they will offer drivers financial incentives to switch to electric cars. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

2,2024-08-05 07:36:42.000,BBC News,2024-08-05 05:36:32.000,"Even after a year in jail, Imran Khan still dominates Pakistan's politics",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cldydnyzd1ro,2024-08-04 23:22:13.000,"Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Imran Khan has now been behind bars for a year – although there are times you would barely know it. Mr Khan is still the dominant force of Pakistan’s opposition politics; his name still in the papers and the courts. His social media supporters have been unrelenting. With no public appearances, the few people allowed in to see the former cricket star regularly – his lawyers and family – have become his conduit for messages to the outside world. They are keen to push the message that his 365 days behind bars have left him unbowed. “There is still a swagger about him,” Aleema Khanum, Imran Khan’s sister, says. “He’s got no needs, no wants - only a cause.” According to those who visit him, Mr Khan spends his days on his exercise bike, reading and reflecting. He has an hour a day to walk around the courtyard. There have been occasional disagreements about how quickly the family can provide him with new books. “He has said ‘I’m not wasting a minute of my time in jail, it’s an opportunity for me to get more knowledge’,” Ms Khanum tells the BBC. But the fact is Mr Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi are still trapped in prison, with no sign they will be released any time soon. According to some, this is not a surprise. “There was no expectation that Mr Khan was going to do anything that would make it easy for him to get out of jail,” says Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Centre think tank in Washington. And the military - Pakistan’s powerful behind-the-scenes player - “don’t ease up when they decide there’s a political figure that they want to lock up”, says Mr Kugelman. “That has especially been the case with Khan.” Indeed, the military has been key to many of the ups and downs of Mr Khan’s life in the last decade. Many analysts believe it was his initial close relationship with the military establishment which helped him win power. But by 9 May last year, that was in tatters. Mr Khan - who had been ousted from power in a vote of no confidence in 2022 - had been arrested, and his supporters came out to protest. Some of those protests turned violent, and there were attacks on military buildings - including the official residence of the most senior army official in Lahore which was looted and set alight. In the aftermath, BBC sources said Pakistan’s media companies had been told to stop showing his picture, saying his name or playing his voice. Mr Khan was released - but ultimately only for a few months. He was jailed again on 5 August for failing to correctly declare the sale of state gifts - and that was just the start. In the run-up to the election, the cases against him mounted; by the start of February - just days before the vote - the 71-year-old had acquired three long prison sentences, the last for 14 years. By the election, many of the candidates standing for Mr Khan's PTI party were also in prison or in hiding, the party stripped of its well-recognised symbol of a cricket bat - a vital identifier in a country with a 58% literacy rate. Despite this, “we were determined and wanted to make a statement”, Salman Akram Raja, Mr Khan’s lawyer and a candidate in the election, says. “It was very constrained, many couldn’t campaign at all. The loss of the cricket bat symbol was the body blow.” All candidates stood as independents, but hopes - even within the party - weren’t high. Yet candidates backed by Imran Khan won more seats than anyone else, forcing his political rivals to form an alliance to block them. The PTI, meanwhile, was left to fight for many of their seats in court, alleging the results were rigged. Supporters see the election on 8 February as a turning point, proof of Mr Khan’s potent message - even from behind bars. “There is a change, that was expressed on 8 February,” says Aleema Khanum. “Change is coming, it is in the air.” Others say that practically, the result hasn’t changed the status quo. “We are really where we might expect to be given past precedent,” Mr Kugelman says. “PTI didn’t form a government, its leader is still in jail and the coalition in power is led by parties backed by the military.” But more recently, things have certainly seemed to be looking up for Mr Khan and his supporters. All three of the sentences handed down just before the election have fallen away, a United Nations panel declared his detention was arbitrary and Pakistan’s supreme court said PTI was an official party and should receive ""reserve seats""; the seats reserved for women and non-Muslims allocated according to the proportion of seats the party has won. But none have yet had a practical impact: Mr Khan is still in jail with new cases against his name, and the reserve seats have yet to be allocated. His wife Bushra Bibi, whose prison sentence was dropped when the case that declared their marriage illegal was appealed, is also still in prison on new charges. Meanwhile, the government has made it clear that it sees Mr Khan and his party as a public threat. It announced earlier this month that it intends to seek to ban PTI, despite warnings from groups like the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. The military also shows no indication it has changed its mind. On the 9 May anniversary this year, a statement from its public relations wing said there would be no compromise with the “planners, facilitators and executioners” and nor would they be allowed to “hoodwink the law of the land”. And it is this relationship with the military that most analysts think Mr Khan really needs to smooth out to finally escape prison. “I think we can come up with an arrangement that gives everyone a way out and allows the system to function,” says Khan’s lawyer, Mr Raja. Meanwhile, from jail, Mr Khan has been delivering his own messages. Aleema Khanum recently said that that he had told the military to ""stay neutral… to let this country run"" and called it ""the backbone of Pakistan"". It has been seen as an olive branch by some commentators, although the use of the term neutral was picked up on; when the army previously declared itself neutral by not taking sides in politics, he ridiculed the expression, saying ""only an animal is neutral"". His recent call for snap elections is a move that some see as one of his conditions to the military. “I don’t think that’s very realistic,” says Mr Kugelman. “Over time, Khan may relent a bit. It is one of the truisms of Pakistani politics: if you want to be prime minister you need to be in the good graces, or at least not the bad graces, of the military.” For now at least, the stalemate continues. A high court acquits Khan in one case, but he will remain in prison because of another conviction. Supporters of Pakistan's jailed former PM and the military are still bitterly divided after his arrest. Pakistan's army has long wielded an unchallenged amount of power over politics - until now. Omar Ayub will face off against the nominee of Khan's rivals, who have joined forces. He declined to take his seat, highlighting vote fraud concerns about Imran Khan's candidates being robbed.

2,2024-08-05 07:36:42.000,BBC News,2024-08-05 05:36:32.000,Can India become rich before its population grows old?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87r7kp55e3o,2024-08-05 03:41:38.000,"For the past two years, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pledged to transform India into a high-income, developed country by 2047. India is also on course to become the world's third largest economy in six years, according to several projections. High-income economies have a per capita Gross National Income - total amount of money earned by a nation's people and businesses - of $13,846 (£10,870) or more, according to the World Bank. With a per capita income of around $2,400 (£1,885), India is among the lower middle-income countries. For some years now, many economists have been warning that India’s economy could be headed for a “middle income trap”. This happens when a country stops being able to achieve rapid growth easily and compete with advanced economies. Economist Ardo Hannson defines it as a situation when countries ""seem to get stuck in a trap where your costs are escalating and you lose competitiveness"". A new World Bank report holds out similar fears. At the current growth rate, India will need 75 years to reach a quarter of America's per capita income, World Development Report 2024 says. It also says more than 100 countries – including India, China, Brazil and South Africa - face “serious obstacles” that could hinder their efforts to become high-income countries in the next few decades. Researchers looked at the numbers from 108 middle-income countries responsible for 40% of the world’s total economic output – and nearly two-thirds of global carbon emissions. They are home to three-quarters of the global population and nearly two-thirds of those in extreme poverty. They say these countries face greater challenges in escaping the middle-income trap. These include rapidly ageing populations, rising protectionism in advanced economies and the urgent need for an accelerated energy transition. “The battle for global economic prosperity will be largely won or lost in middle-income countries,” says Indermit Gill, chief economist of the World Bank and one of the study's authors. “But too many of these countries rely on outmoded strategies to become advanced economies. They depend just on investment for too long - or they switch prematurely to innovation.” For example, the researchers say, the pace at which businesses can grow is often slow in middle-income countries. In India, Mexico, and Peru, firms that operate for 40 years typically double in size, while in the US, they grow seven-fold in the same period. This indicates that firms in middle-income countries struggle to grow significantly, but still survive for decades. Consequently, nearly 90% of firms in India, Peru, and Mexico have fewer than five employees, with only a small fraction having 10 or more, the report says. Mr Gill and his fellow researchers advocate a new approach: these countries need to focus on more investment, infuse new technologies from around the world and grow innovation. South Korea exemplifies this strategy, the report says. In 1960, its per capita income was $1,200 - it rose to $33,000 by 2023. Initially, South Korea boosted public and private investment. In the 1970s, it shifted to an industrial policy that encouraged domestic firms to adopt foreign technology and advanced production methods. Companies like Samsung responded. Initially a noodle-maker, Samsung began producing TV sets for domestic and regional markets by licensing technologies from Japanese firms. This success created a demand for skilled professionals. The government increased budgets and set targets for public universities to develop these skills. Today, Samsung is a global innovator and one of the world's largest smartphone manufacturers, the report says. Countries like Poland and Chile followed similar paths, the report says. Poland boosted productivity by adopting Western European technologies. Chile encouraged technology transfer to drive local innovation, famously adapting Norwegian salmon farming techniques to become a top salmon exporter. History provides enough clues about an impending middle-income trap. Researchers reveal that as countries grow wealthier, they often hit a ""trap"" at around 10% of US GDP per capita ($8,000 today), placing them in the middle-income range. That’s roughly in the middle of what the bank classifies as “middle-income” countries. Since 1990, only 34 middle-income countries have transitioned to high-income status, with over a third benefiting from integration into European Union (EU) or newfound oil reserves. Economists Raghuram Rajan and Rohit Lamba separately estimate that even at a very respectable per capita income growth rate of 4%, India’s per capita income will reach $10,000 only by 2060, which is lower than China’s level today. “We must do better. Over the next decade, we will see a possible population dividend, that is rise in the share of our population of working age, before we, like other countries, succumb to ageing,” they write in their new book Breaking The Mould: Reimagining India's Economic Future. “If we can generate good employment for all our youth, we will accelerate growth and have a shot at becoming comfortably upper middle class before our population starts ageing.” In other words, the economists wonder, “Can India become rich before it becomes old?""

2,2024-08-05 07:36:42.000,BBC News,2024-08-05 05:36:32.000,Zambians mourn gospel singer popular in churches and clubs,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c72007nz6y2o,2024-08-04 23:14:56.000,"Some of Zambia’s top musicians have performed at a concert to mourn 46-year-old gospel singer Matthew Ngosa, a day before his burial in the capital, Lusaka. The audience joined in to belt out his beloved hits at the Praise Christian Centre. Such was the popularity of some of his songs that they were not only played in churches but also in nightclubs over a two-decade career. The venue in Lusaka was packed with fans, friends, family and government officials. His older brother Boyd, also a musician - popularly known as BJ - led mourners. Matthew started out singing with BJ and his younger brother Hezron when they were still at high school, often singing a cappella. They knew they wanted to make a career out of their music - not an easy ambition in a country where piracy means most musicians get little money from their music. Matthew and Hezron formed a duo called The Ezma Brothers within a larger group known as The Tribe Called Christians. Later, at Lusaka’s Northmead Assemblies of God Church, Matthew joined The Christ Ambassador Choir, where he polished his skills. In 2004 he released his highly successful debut album Umutima Wandi (My Heart), which dominated music charts. Gospel hits including Ukulolela (Waiting) and Ndakunkula (Rolling to God in Praise) followed - those two also becoming anthems for clubbers. Matthew Ngosa never made it rich, but was able to make a decent living from his hits before he was diagnosed with liver cancer in January. He died two days before he had been due to return to India for a check-up. Hezron told the BBC he would miss his brother’s sense of humour: “He would go out of his way to make people happy. He was very strong even in sickness. He was a man of faith.” This generosity of spirit was echoed by gospel musician Kings Mumbi. “To me, he was a mentor. When I recorded my first song, I took it to him to critique and that’s why I have never gone astray. He was more than a brother,” he told the BBC. “When a pastor invited Matthew Ngosa to their church to sing but couldn’t pay him, he would not bother that pastor because for Matthew, singing was part of his ministry. He took it as a way of spreading the word of God.” The development of Zambia’s music industry may suffer from piracy, but most Christians prefer buying original albums directly from the musicians as a way of promoting the growth of gospel music. Others believe that buying pirated gospel music is a sin that is tantamount to theft. “Your untimely death has crushed me, and broken the hearts of believers and shocked an entire nation,” televangelist and former Vice-President Nevers Mumba posted on Facebook after Ngosa’s death was announced on Friday. “My only consolation is that I know you will announce your arrival in heaven from Zambia in style. As you walk through that golden door, I can almost hear you singing with all the power that your vocal cords can manage.” His words reflect the outpouring of grief for Ngosa in Zambia, a largely Christian country where church attendance is high. President Hakainde Hichilema conveyed his message of condolences to the family while his predecessor Edgar Lungu visited the funeral house on Saturday. Ngosa, who had two daughters with Tasila Ngombe, once served as a civic leader in Mr Lungu’s party, the Patriotic Front. BJ told the BBC that their mother Samaria Maswela was fundamental to all three of the Ngosa brothers' careers. ""She used to sing in church and her own mother and father used to sing as well. Our mother is the one who introduced us to Sunday school music in the United Church of Zambia [UCZ] when we were still kids.” She joined BJ on stage towards the end of the three-hour concert on Sunday, with other tearful family members, to sing Matthew’s classic Umutima Wandi - a praise song in the Bemba language, thanking God for life’s blessings.

2,2024-08-05 07:36:42.000,BBC News,2024-08-05 05:36:32.000,"World's biggest iceberg is spinning, caught in an ocean trap",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd168081wxvo,2024-08-03 23:05:44.000,"Something remarkable has happened to A23a, the world's biggest iceberg. For months now it has been spinning on the spot just north of Antarctica when really it should be racing along with Earth's most powerful ocean current. Scientists say the frozen block, which is more than twice the size of Greater London, has been captured on top of a huge rotating cylinder of water. It's a phenomenon oceanographers call a Taylor Column - and it's possible A23a might not escape its jailer for years. ""Usually you think of icebergs as being transient things; they fragment and melt away. But not this one,"" observed polar expert Prof Mark Brandon. ""A23a is the iceberg that just refuses to die,"" the Open University researcher told BBC News. The berg's longevity is well documented. It broke free from the Antarctic coastline way back in 1986, but then almost immediately got stuck in the bottom-muds of the Weddell Sea. For three decades it was a static ""ice island"". It didn't budge. It wasn't until 2020 that it re-floated and started to drift again, slowly at first, before then charging north towards warmer air and waters. In early April this year, A23a stepped into the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) - a juggernaut that moves a hundred times as much water around the globe as all Earth's rivers combined. This was meant to put boosters on the near-trillion-tonne berg, rifling it up into the South Atlantic and certain oblivion. Instead, A23a went precisely nowhere. It remains in place just north of South Orkney Islands, turning in an anti-clockwise direction by about 15 degrees a day. And as long as it does this, its decay and eventual demise will be delayed. A23a has not grounded again; there is at least a thousand metres of water between its underside and the seafloor. It's been stopped in its tracks by a type of vortex first described in the 1920s by a brilliant physicist, Sir G.I. (Geoffrey Ingram) Taylor. The Cambridge academic was a pioneer in the field of fluid dynamics, and was even brought into the Manhattan Project to model the likely stability of the world's first atomic bomb test. Prof Taylor showed how a current that meets an obstruction on the seafloor can - under the right circumstances - separate into two distinct flows, generating a full-depth mass of rotating water between them. In this instance, the obstruction is a 100km-wide bump on the ocean bottom known as Pirie Bank. The vortex sits on top of the bank, and for now A23a is its prisoner. ""The ocean is full of surprises, and this dynamical feature is one of the cutest you'll ever see,"" said Prof Mike Meredith from the British Antarctic Survey. ""Taylor Columns can also form in the air; you see them in the movement of clouds above mountains. They can be just a few centimetres across in an experimental laboratory tank or absolutely enormous as in this case where the column has a giant iceberg slap-bang in the middle of it."" How long might A23a continue to perform its spinning-top routine? Who knows, but when Prof Meredith placed a scientific buoy in a Taylor Column above another bump to the east of Pirie Bank, the floating instrument was still rotating in place four years later. A23a is a perfect illustration once again of the importance of understanding the shape of the seafloor. Submarine mountains, canyons and slopes have a profound influence on the direction and mixing of waters, and on the distribution of the nutrients that drive biological activity in the ocean. And this influence extends also to the climate system: it's the mass movement of water that helps disperse heat energy around the globe. A23a's behaviour can be explained because the ocean bottom just north of South Orkney is reasonably well surveyed. That's not the case for much of the rest of the world. Currently, only a quarter of Earth's seafloor has been mapped to the best modern standard. Parents praise the work of Jersey charity Healing Waves in its work with neurodiverse children.

2,2024-08-05 07:36:42.000,BBC News,2024-08-05 05:36:32.000,'They're tightening the screws': Kremlin ups attacks on critics abroad,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl4y0j47xe4o,2024-08-04 00:50:57.000,"Two plain-clothed UK police officers were waiting for Dmitry Gudkov as he arrived at London’s Luton Airport last summer. The Russian opposition politician, who lives in exile in an EU country, was flying to the UK to attend a friend’s birthday. “They were there to intercept me immediately after I exited the plane,” Dmitry says. “That had never happened to me before."" But the police weren’t arresting him – instead, they wanted to warn him. “They told me I’m on a list of people who are in danger. They asked where I’ll be staying and what phone I’ll be using.” Dmitry Gudkov is the co-founder of the Anti-War Committee, an organisation that co-ordinates efforts to oppose the war in Ukraine. He is wanted in Russia for ""spreading fakes"" about the Russian army. The start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 led to a wide-ranging crackdown against opponents inside Russia. Almost all activists and independent journalists fled the country. Now, a number of Kremlin critics living in Europe have told the BBC that Russia is stepping up its efforts to silence, threaten and persecute opponents abroad. Some were unwilling to share their stories publicly. The Russian embassy in London didn’t respond to a request for comment. Analyst Mark Galeotti, who studies the Russian security services, agrees that the campaign against Russia’s ""enemies"" abroad is intensifying. “I think it reflects the growing paranoia of the Kremlin,” he says, “that it is involved in an existential political struggle."" With all dissent snuffed out at home, Russia is turning its attention to opponents who have sought refuge in the West. Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president who is now deputy head of Russia's Security Council, described them as “traitors who have gone over to the enemy and want their Fatherland to perish”. Another anti-Kremlin activist was also contacted by British police. “They said they needed to discuss the safety of me and my family,” Ksenia Maximova tells me. The founder of the Russian Democratic Society in London says the police advised her not to travel to certain countries where Russian agents operate more freely. “[The Kremlin is] stepping up the campaign against ‘enemies’, that’s absolutely true,” she says, “They’re tightening the screws.” She and her fellow campaigners have noticed an uptick in cyber attacks and attempts to infiltrate the group online. In a statement to the BBC, a spokesperson for UK Counter Terrorism Policing said, “We have been open for some time now about the growing demand within our casework relating to countering state threats… We have been actively increasing resources dedicated to countering the activity of hostile states.” In December, new UK legislation came into effect, giving police more powers to tackle threats from hostile states such as Russia. ""Parasites can’t sleep in peace..."" was one of the messages that investigative journalist Alesya Marokhovskaya received last year. The threats were accompanied by the name of the street in Prague where she lived. “I moved house to make it harder for them,” says Alesya. “We thought it may just be some crazy Czech guy who was pro-Putin and had recognised me on the street.” But then the messages became more sinister - calling her a ""scumbag"" and promising to find her ""wherever she walks her wheezing dog"". Alesya’s dog really does wheeze when it walks. She informed the Czech police. Later, Alesya was due to fly to Sweden to attend a conference. The sender then sent even more specific threats: details of her flight, seat number and the hotel she had booked. “It was clear they had high-level access to documents,” Alesya says. “It looks like the behaviour of the Russian state.” Alesya had been branded a 'foreign agent’ years before by the Russian government, due to her work at independent Russian news website iStories. “When I left Russia and came to Prague, I had this illusion of security,” says Alesya. “Now I realise that [Russian intelligence services] can get their hands on people almost anywhere in Europe. I can’t say I’m not afraid, because I am."" But why is this happening now? Experts suggest the Russian security services are beginning to activate operations abroad after a period of turmoil. Hundreds of Russian diplomats believed to be intelligence agents operating under diplomatic cover were expelled from Western countries following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. “There was a period of confusion after 2022,” says Andrei Soldatov, a Russian journalist who writes about the intelligence services. “In 2023, the agencies regrouped and found a new sense of purpose. They got resources and began increasing pressure.” Mark Galeotti says the authorities are increasingly turning to proxies to do their dirty work - criminal gangs: “If you want someone beaten up or even killed, they’re a lot easier to engage,” says Mr Galeotti, who has been writing about the links between the Russian state and organised crime for years. “They’re going to be some thug – maybe someone whom the Russian-based organised crime groups have at some point dealt with.” The Polish government believes that’s what happened in the case of Leonid Volkov, a prominent activist and associate of the late Alexei Navalny. He was brutally attacked with a hammer in Lithuania four months ago, but survived. The Polish Prime Minister, Donald Tusk, said a Belarusian man working for Russian intelligence had paid two Polish football hooligans to carry out the assault. All three have been arrested. “Intimidation is the intent,” suggests Mark Galeotti. “The idea that you'd better keep your head down. It’s a way of deterring the emergence of some kind of coherent political opposition [to the Kremlin].” The Russian authorities also try to make day-to-day life as difficult as possible for opponents abroad. Activist Olesya Krivtsova, 21, escaped from Russia after being arrested and threatened with jail for anti-war posts on social media. She now lives in Norway, but recently discovered her Russian passport had been cancelled, meaning she can’t apply for travel documents. “I think this is a new [method] of repression,” Olesya says. “They’re always thinking, how can we do more, how can we pressure them?” Several other activists living abroad have also had their passports cancelled without warning. Many have criminal cases open against them in Russia - without a valid passport, they cannot hire lawyers or make payments back home. The only way to resolve the issue is to return to Russia. For Olesya, returning would mean arrest and prison. She has now applied for a temporary Norwegian ID for refugees. “In Russia, now I only have one right – the right to go to prison. My passport is cancelled. This shows the essence of their cruelty,” says the young activist. “They’ve already completely destroyed my life and the life of my family…They’re never going to stop.” Marc Fogel, 63, is serving a 14-year prison sentence in Russia and was excluded from the prisoner swap. The Dultsev children thought they were from Argentina and cannot speak Russian. Seven people have now been charged over a suspected arson attack against a Ukraine-linked business. Both also conveyed gratitude to the countries who worked to free them. The president is using his final months in office to take a victory lap after weeks of personal and political turmoil.

1,2024-08-06 07:36:50.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-06 05:27:12.000,Markets digest bank earnings after recent turmoil,https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/stock-market-bank-earnings/index.html,2023-04-14 20:00:28.000,"Our live coverage for the day has ended. Follow the latest business news here or read through the updates below. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm, slashed Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink’s pay by 30% to $25.2 million for 2022, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The move comes after the money manager reported first-quarter revenue that was down 10% from a year ago, as rising interest rates and economic uncertainty impacted the firm’s bottom line. “With respect to 2022 compensation, management determined to reduce the impact of the firm’s decline in profitability on BlackRock’s broader employee population by concentrating the downward adjustments to total incentive awards toward senior management,” the filing said. Total compensation for Fink, 70, included a base salary of $1.5 million and $23.7 million in total incentive awards. Several other executives saw their compensation reduced, including Rob Kapito, the firm’s president, whose package shrank by 34% to $18.95 million. UBS’ purchase of Credit Suisse’s US subsidiaries can move forward, the Federal Reserve said Friday. The statement comes a month after UBS stepped in to rescue the embattled Swiss lender and prevent turmoil in the financial sector from spreading, after an emergency loan of nearly $54 billion from the Swiss National Bank failed to stop the carnage. The problems for Credit Suisse began when the Saudi National Bank, its largest backer, said it wouldn’t put up more cash after buying a nearly 10% stake in the bank for $1.5 billion in 2022. Banking customers were already on edge after the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank — so Credit Suisse shares tumbled more than 25% and saw billions of dollars of outflows. The global turmoil has led US lawmakers to call for tighter regulations on banks. The Fed board said UBS will provide a quarterly updated plan for combining UBS’s and Credit Suisse’s US business and operations. “The implementation plan will address UBS’s obligations to comply with more stringent enhanced prudential standards, including liquidity standards,” the Fed said in a statement. UBS is shelling out 3 billion Swiss francs, or $3.25 billion, for Credit Suisse. Stocks slid Friday after a slate of earnings beats from big banks fueled concerns that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its next two meetings. Still, the major indices gained for the week. The Dow rose 400 points, or 1.2%. The S&P 500 gained 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.3%. JPMorgan Chase on Friday reported first-quarter profit and revenue that crushed expectations, boosted by the Fed’s interest rate hiking campaign. Citigroup, Wells Fargo and PNC Financial also reported strong results. CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors in the company’s post-earnings conference call that they should prepare for interest rates to be higher for longer than expected. Wall Street seems to have taken note. Analysts increased their bets on a quarter-point rate hike at the Fed’s meeting in May and another in June. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Friday that the central bank needs to continue tightening monetary policy, further weighing down markets. Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said that it’s “definitely” possible the United States enters a mild recession after the tumult in banking last month. Meanwhile, retail sales data declined more than expected, suggesting that Americans’ spending power and the US economy are weakening. Consumer sentiment held fairly steady in April, even as concerns about a recession linger, according to the University of Michigan’s latest monthly survey. “There was too much news to digest this morning, but the key takeaway is that the Fed has room to do more harm,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, said in a note. The Dow slipped 144 points, or 0.4%. The S&P 500 tumbled 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite sank 0.4%. As stocks settle after the trading day, levels might still change slightly. Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said Friday he isn’t discounting the recent assessment from central bank economists that the banking crisis will tip the United States into a mild recession later this year. “There’s no way you can look at current conditions around the world and in the US and not think that some mild recession is definitely on the table as a possibility,” Goolsbee said Friday during an interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” He added that, when viewed historically, the monetary tightening campaign undertaken by the Fed — hiking interest rates nine times in just over a year — is expected to slow GDP growth. “When you get numbers like retail sales and others that are declining, if you look at construction, I think we’ve got to think about what’s the state of growth in the country,” he said. “Fortunately, the labor market continues to be very strong.” Critics have lambasted the World Bank and, particularly, the International Monetary Fund, for predicting Russia’s economy would hold relatively stable this year despite international sanctions. But sanctions are hurting Russia’s economy, even if World Bank forecasts don’t reflect it, according to the outgoing World Bank President David Malpass. Speaking to Julia Chatterley at the IMF-World Bank spring conference, David Malpass responded to criticism that you couldn’t trust GDP and economic data from Russia. He admitted “the quality of the data differs substantially by country…the reality is there’s not very much in terms of double checking of data”. In January, the IMF projected that Russia’s economy would expand by 0.3% this year and 2.1% the next. That was much more optimistic than the latest forecasts from the World Bank, which still penciled in a contraction of just 3.3% this year. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development was the most pessimistic, forecasting a 5.6% contraction in Russia’s economy in 2023. Malpass said that GDP numbers were not capturing the “reality” and “horror” of the war, and noted the Russian economy was suffering. “I think life is hard in Russia…they’re excluded from travelling to many parts of the world, their supply chains have to change dramatically… young people moving out because they don’t want to be part of this war,” Malpass said. Consumer sentiment tracked by the University of Michigan held steady in April, according to a preliminary reading released Friday. So far, the university’s monthly surveys have shown a limited impact from the banking crisis on consumers’ attitudes, but Americans remain concerned about an upcoming recession and some lingering fears about inflation persist. “Consumers are expecting a downturn, they’re not feeling as dismal as they were last summer, but they’re waiting for the other shoe to drop,” said Joanne Hsu, director of the surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan, in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Friday morning. “We now have about a month of data following the collapse of SVB, and there hasn’t really been much of an effect on sentiment at all,” she said. The latest survey also showed that higher gas prices helped push up year-ahead inflation expectations by a full percentage point, rising from 3.6% in March to 4.6% in April. “Consumers are still feeling the pain of high prices,” Hsu told Bloomberg, noting that survey respondents were now mentioning gas prices for the first time since fall. The latest cooldown in consumer and producer price hikes as well as the latest decline in retail sales are indications that the Federal Reserve’s efforts are working to bring down high inflation, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee told CNBC on Friday. “You don’t want to overreact to short-run news, but it feel likes like that’s moving in the right direction,” he said during an appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” Goolsbee was quick to note that an area of critical importance to him in advance of the next Fed meeting is activity in banking and credit. Earlier this week, Goolsbee noted that the Fed needs to be “on watch” for tighter credit conditions as a result of the banking turmoil last month. He referenced private sector analyst estimates that the spillover effects of the crisis equate to the Fed enacting rate hikes anywhere from a quarter point to three-quarters of a point. “I’m an old-school data dog,” Goolsbee said Friday. “What I would do is spend the next three weeks getting out and figuring out how much credit tightening is coming.” Chief executives at some of the largest banks in the United States were forced to address the elephant in the room as they reported first-quarter earnings on Friday morning: The regional banking crisis that brought Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank to ruin last month. > Banking industry turmoil has added to risks of recessionary “storm clouds” on the horizon, said JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon Friday in a release. He added that “the banking situation is distinct from 2008 as it has involved far fewer financial players and fewer issues that need to be resolved.” Still, said Dimon, who leads the country’s largest bank, “financial conditions will likely tighten as lenders become more conservative, and we do not know if this will slow consumer spending.” >“We are glad to have been in a strong position to help support the US financial system during the recent events that impacted the banking industry,” commented Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf in a statement. “Regional and community banks are an important part of our financial system and are uniquely positioned to serve their customers and communities.” > “I believe today’s crisis of confidence in the regional banking sector will further accelerate capital markets growth, and BlackRock will be a central player,” wrote BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on Friday. “Increased financing through the capital markets will require the scale, multi-asset capabilities and excellence in portfolio construction that BlackRock consistently delivers across market cycles,” he said in a statement. That means bad news for regional banks could be good news for BlackRock – the lack of trust in regional banks will drive more investment into capital markets and BlackRock is poised to benefit as that happens. “Throughout our history, moments of market dislocation and disruption have served as inflection points for BlackRock,” he explained. Regulators also hired BlackRock in early April to help the US government in the sale of the $114 billion in assets it collected from the collapse> Citigroup and PNC did not address the banking crisis in their releases, but will likely answer questions about how they’ve weathered the turmoil and what they see ahead at their first-quarter presentations, planned for 11 a.m. ET. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors Friday not to be caught unawares if interest rates stay higher longer than expected. “People need to be prepared. They shouldn’t pray that they don’t go up. They should prepare for them going up. And if it doesn’t happen, serendipity,” Dimon said on the company’s post-earnings conference call. High interest rates have helped big banks, including JPMorgan Chase, since they widen the gap between the interest paid to customers and what they earn from investing that money. But climbing rates also helped drive last month’s collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which held 55% of its customers deposits in long-dated bonds whose value diminished as interest rates rose. Dimon stated that he believes the banking crisis will pass — even though he expects its effects to reverberate through the sector for years to come — but that the possibility of higher interest rates should remain on companies’ radars. “If and when that happens, it will address problems in the economy. For those who are too exposed to floating rates, or those who are too exposed to [refinancing] risk, those exposures will be in multiple parts of the economy,” Dimon said. “Now would be the time to fix it. Do not put yourself in a position where that risk is excessive for your company, your business, your investment pools,” he said. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the largest US bank, told investors Friday that he isn’t too worried about a credit crunch resulting from the recent banking crisis. “I wouldn’t use the word[s] ‘credit crunch,’” he said in response to a question about whether he was worried that lending would tighten in the bank after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. There will be “a little bit of tightening,” said Dimon, but that will mostly be contained within the real estate market. Dimon added that he’s more worried about recession than a credit crunch. “I just look at it as a kind of a thumb on the scale. It just makes the financing conditions a little bit tighter and increases the odds of a recession,” he said. “That’s what that is. It’s not like a credit crunch.” JPMorgan Chase said Friday its exposure to the office sector is limited, addressing concerns about the commercial real estate industry’s stability. “Given the recent focus on commercial real estate, let me remind you that our office sector exposure is less than 10% of our portfolio and is focused in urban dense markets, and nearly two-thirds of our loans are multifamily, primarily in supply-constrained markets,” said Jeremy Barnum, chief financial officer, in the company’s post-earnings conference call. Investors and regulators are watching the $20 trillion US commercial real estate market for signs that it could be the next shoe to drop after the banking tumult last month. That’s partly because the value of buildings is going down, particularly as offices in major cities remain vacant or half-empty as Americans opt to work from home. The commercial real estate industry’s woes come after decades of unbridled growth powered by low interest rates and easy credit. That upward trend was interrupted by the Covid pandemic’s onset, and then when the Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates aggressively last year to stabilize the economy. “There are obviously some big things here and there to pay attention to, but in the scheme of things for us, not a big issue,” Barnum said. Spending at US retailers fell in March as consumers pulled back amid recessionary fears fueled by the banking crisis. Retail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation, fell by 1% in March from the prior month, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. That was steeper than an expected 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv, and above the revised 0.2% decline in the prior month. The drop was driven by a pullback in spending at department stores and on durable goods such as appliances and furniture. Spending at general merchandise stores fell 3% in March from the prior month and spending at gas stations declined 5.5% during the same period. Excluding gas station sales, retail spending retreated 0.6% in March from February. However, year-on-year retail spending rose 2.9%. Citigroup shares were up about 0.8% in premarket trading after the bank posted strong first-quarter profits, beating analyst expectations for both earnings per share and revenue. The bank brought in $21.4 billion in revenue versus expectations of $19.9 billion. Earnings per share were $2.19, estimates were for $1.67. Citi CEO Jane Fraser and CFO Mark Mason will hold an earnings presentation at 11 a.m. ET. Stocks slid Friday, even as big banks reported beats on their first-quarter earnings in an auspicious start to earnings season. Investors were watching for clues about the financial sector’s stability, and whether the tumult in the sector last month could lead to tighter lending standards. A key point of interest was also how much big banks benefitted from increased deposit inflows when nervous customers fled from regional banks after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. JPMorgan, the largest bank in the United States and an economic bellwether, posted record revenue. Wells Fargo, Citigroup and PNC Financial Services also reported earnings beats. Shares of JPMorgan Chase gained 4.8%, Wells Fargo rose 0.7%, Citigroup added 1.9% and PNC Financial Services ticked up 0.3%. Meanwhile, retail sales came in weaker than expected as recession fears loom. Retail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation, fell by 1% in March from the month before, according to the Commerce Department. Economists expected a 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv. The Dow fell 38 points, or about 0.1%. The S&P 500 sank 0.1%. The Nasdaq Composite declined 0.5%. The Federal Reserve could end its historic rate-hiking campaign after just one more quarter-point increase, said Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic in a Thursday interview with Reuters. The Fed has approved nine rate hikes in a row since last March, the effects of which are only now starting to “bite,” Bostic said. Monetary policy can take months to trickle through the economy, but a slew of recent data suggests that inflation is finally cooling. The March Consumer Price Index shows price hikes have slowed for nine months in a row, and headline wholesale inflation reflected in the Producer Price Index has sunk to 2.7% after reaching double digit highs last year. Bostic said the recent “chaos” in the banking sector, after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, persuaded him to rethink the pace of rate hikes. However, he told Reuters he believes the turmoil will not have any lasting impact on the the US economy. Analysts expect the Fed to raise rates by a quarter point at its upcoming policy meeting on May 2-3, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Regional bank PNC Financial reported first-quarter revenue of $5.6 billion and earnings per share of $3.98 vs. expectations of $3.66. Shares rose 5% on the news. Wells Fargo reported first-quarter revenue of $20.7 billion against expectations of $20.1 billion. The San Francisco-based bank saw earnings of $4.9 billion, up from $3.8 billion a year earlier, an increase of about 32%. Shares of Wells Fargo rose 2.2%. JPMorgan Chase on Friday reported first-quarter profit and revenue that roundly beat expectations, boosted by a year of rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. The New York-based bank posted a profit of $12.6 billion or $4.10 per share. That’s up from $8.3 billion, or $2.63 per share from the same period a year before. Analysts expected earnings of $3.41 per share, according to Refinitiv. With $3.67 trillion in assets, JPMorgan Chase is the largest bank in the United States and a bellwether for the US economy. “The US economy continues to be on generally healthy footings — consumers are still spending and have strong balance sheets, and businesses are in good shape. However, the storm clouds that we have been monitoring for the past year remain on the horizon,” CEO Jamie Dimon said in a press release. Net interest income rose to $20.8 billion, up 49% from the prior year, driven by the aggressive interest rate campaign the Fed kicked off last year to stabilize prices. Deposits rose to $2.38 trillion during the first quarter from $2.34 trillion in the quarter ended in December. That comes after the banking tumult last month triggered a rush into big banks from nervous customers. Investors also looked to money market funds as a haven. A key point of conversation after last month’s turmoil in the banking sector has been whether banks could tighten lending standards, leading customers to spend less as it becomes more difficult to borrow money for large purchases like homes and cars. “Financial conditions will likely tighten as lenders become more conservative, and we do not know if this will slow consumer spending,” Dimon said, adding that JPMorgan Chase is “confident that we can serve the needs of our customers and clients in all environments.” Shares of JPMorgan Chase climbed 6.1% in pre-market trading. The company’s post-earnings conference call is slated for 8:30 a.m. ET. Stocks: US stock futures fell ahead of several bank earnings this morning. Investors also fretted a retail sales report that is expected to show consumers are pulling back on their spending. Dow futures were down 75 points, or 0.2%. S&P 500 futures fell 0.2%. Nasdaq futures were 0.4% lower. European stocks were higher and Asian stocks closed up. Fear & Greed Index: 67 = Greed Oil & gas: US oil prices were up 0.3% to $82 a barrel. Average US gas prices rose to $3.66 a gallon. Wall Street is searching for answers to two key questions: Is the economy headed for a recession? And, if so, who’s poised to weather it? Recession fears have ramped up in recent weeks after the banking tumult last month raised concerns about the financial sector’s health. Earnings season for banks starts on Friday with JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, BlackRock, Citigroup and PNC Financial Services slated to report before the bell. Investors will be watching for clues about stability. Stocks have yet to price in the economy’s precarious position, with the S&P 500 adding about 7% this year. But markets have already seen volatile trading since then. “We’re going to see a correction happen here, because it just never makes sense when the market’s going up and earnings are going down,” says Eric Sterner, chief investment officer at Apollon Wealth Management. But while earnings are an undeniable factor driving markets, inflation remains a key concern. Wall Street remains overly optimistic that the Fed will cut rates later this year — even after officials indicated last month that they likely won’t — or that it could even orchestrate a soft landing. That hope, and the market’s resilience, could start to crumble in the next few weeks, said Megan Horneman, chief investment officer at Verdence Capital Advisors. “You very well could see that catalyst over the next couple of weeks with earnings, and then this inflation data and then what the Fed says when they meet,” said Horneman. Jeremy Grantham made his name predicting the dot-com crash in 2000 and the financial crisis in 2008. Now, the famous investor warns another epic bubble in financial markets is bursting — and the turmoil that swept through the banking sector last month is just the beginning. “Other things will break, and who knows what they will be,” Grantham told CNN in an exclusive interview. “We’re by no means finished with the stress to the financial system.” Since early 2022, when the S&P 500 hit an all-time high, US stocks have dropped about 15% as central banks have jacked up borrowing costs. But Grantham sees much steeper declines on the horizon. The “best we can hope for,” he said, is a fall of about 27% from current levels, while the worst-case scenario would see a plunge of more than 50%. The low point might not arrive until “deep into next year,” he added. Grantham sees uncomfortable parallels between markets today and 2000, when an explosion in the price of tech stocks was followed by a dizzying crash. There are also echoes of 2008, when a painful comedown in the US housing market almost broke the banking system. What’s even more worrying is that this time, bubbles in the stock market and the real estate market are poised to burst simultaneously, Grantham said. The broader US banking system remains sound and stable, but the two regional banks that failed were “poorly managed” and “took unacceptable risks,” White House economic adviser Lael Brainard told CNN’s Poppy Harlow in an interview Wednesday at Semafor’s World Economy Summit in Washington, DC. Last month’s collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank roiled markets and spread fear through the economy of a possible wider banking crisis. The US Treasury, Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation all intervened to ensure bank customers could access all their money and to attempt to stave off future bank runs. “The banking system, it’s very sound, it’s stable; the core of the banking system has a great deal of capital that was put in place in the wake of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis,” said Brainard, director of the White House National Economic Council. “There were some banks who were not managing their risks effectively. They failed, and the president took strong actions along with the Secretary of the Treasury and the banking regulators,” she said. “Those actions reassured Americans their deposits are safe, the banking system is sound; but it was also important to the president that the executives of those failed banks were held accountable and, very important, that taxpayer money not be at risk,” she continued. Before its collapse last month, Silicon Valley Bank was known to investors of color as a place that fostered a community of minority entrepreneurs and provided them with both social and financial capital. SVB regularly sponsored conferences and networking events for minority entrepreneurs, and it was well known for funding the annual State of Black Venture Report spearheaded by BLK VC, a nonprofit organization that connects and empowers Black investors. “When other banks were saying no, SVB would say yes,” said Joynicole Martinez, a 25-year entrepreneur and chief advancement and innovation officer for Rising Tide Capital, a nonprofit organization founded in 2004 to connect entrepreneurs with investors and mentors. Minority business owners have long faced challenges accessing capital due to discriminatory lending practices, experts say. Data from the Small Business Credit Survey, a collaboration of all 12 Federal Reserve banks, shows disparities on denial rates for bank and nonbank loans. In 2021, about 16% of Black-led companies acquired the total amount of business financing they sought from banks, compared to 35% of White-owned companies, the survey shows. “We know there’s historic, systemic, and just blatant racism that’s inherent in lending and banking. We have to start there and not tip-toe around it,” Martinez told CNN. The Financial Services Forum, an organization representing the eight largest financial institutions in the United States has said banks have committed millions of dollars since 2020 to address economic and racial inequality.

1,2024-08-06 07:36:50.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-06 05:27:12.000,Still haven't filed your taxes? Here's what you need to know,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/13/success/tax-filing-tips/index.html,2023-04-14 20:07:40.000,"Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks So far this tax season, the IRS has received more than 100 million income tax returns for 2022. That means tens of millions of households have yet to file their returns. If yours is among them, here are some last-minute tax-filing tips to keep in mind as the Tuesday, April 18 deadline approaches. Not everyone has to file on April 18: If you live in a federally declared disaster area, have a business there — or have relevant tax documents stored by businesses in that area — it’s likely the IRS has already extended the filing and payment deadlines for you. Here is where you can find the specific extension dates for each disaster area. Thanks to many rounds of extreme weather in recent months, for instance, tax filers in most of California — which accounts for 10% to 15% of all federal filers — have already been granted an extension until Oct. 16 to file and to pay, according to an IRS spokesperson. If you’re in the armed forces and are currently or were recently stationed in a combat zone, the filing and payment deadlines for your 2022 taxes are most likely extended by 180 days. But your specific extended filing and payment deadlines will depend on the day you leave (or left) the combat zone. This IRS publication offers more detail. Taxes and adulting: What to know about filing taxes on your own for the first time Lastly, if you made little to no money last year (typically less than $12,950 for single filers and $25,900 for married couples), you may not be required to file a return. But you may want to anyway if you think you are eligible for a refund thanks to, for instance, refundable tax credits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit. (Use this IRS tool to gauge whether you are required to file this year.) You also are likely eligible to use IRS Free File (intended for those with adjusted gross income of $73,000 or less) so it won’t cost you to submit a return. Your paycheck may not be your only source of income: If you had one full-time job you may think that is the only income you made and have to report. But that’s not necessarily so. Other potentially taxable and reportable income sources include: Organize your tax documents: By now you should have received every tax document that third parties are required to send you (your employer, bank, brokerage, etc.). If you don’t recall receiving a hard copy of a tax form in the mail, check your email and your online accounts — a document may have been sent to you electronically. Here are some of the tax forms you may have received: “Be aware that there’s no form for some taxable income, like proceeds from renting out your vacation property, meaning you’re responsible for reporting it on your own,” according to the Illinois CPA Society. One very last-minute way to reduce your 2022 tax bill: If you’re eligible to make a tax-deductible contribution to an IRA and haven’t done so for last year, you have until April 18 to contribute up to $6,000 ($7,000 if you’re 50 or older). That will reduce your tax bill and augment your retirement savings. Proofread your return before submitting it: Do this whether you’re using tax software or working with a professional tax preparer. Little mistakes and oversights delay the processing of your return (and the issuance of your refund if you’re owed one). You want to avoid things like having a typo in your name, birth date, Social Security number or direct deposit number; choosing the wrong filing status (e.g., married vs single); making a simple math error; or leaving a required field blank. What to do if you can’t file by April 18: If you’re not able to file by next Tuesday, fill out Form 4868 electronically or on paper and send it in by April 18. You will be granted an automatic six-month extension to file. Your tax refund may be smaller this year. Here's why Note, however, that an extension to file is not an extension to pay. You will be charged interest (currently running at 7%) and a penalty on any amount you still owe for 2022 but haven’t paid by April 18. So if you suspect you still owe tax — perhaps you had some income outside of your job for which tax wasn’t withheld or you had a big capital gain last year — approximate how much more you owe and send that money to the IRS by Tuesday. You can choose to do so by mail, attaching a check to your extension request form. Make sure your envelope is postmarked no later than April 18. Or the more efficient route is pay what you owe electronically at IRS.gov, said CPA Damien Martin, a tax partner at EY. If you do that, the IRS notes you will not have to file a Form 4868. “The IRS will automatically process an extension of time to file,” the agency notes in its instructions. If you opt to electronically pay directly from your bank account, which is free, select “extension” and then “tax year 2022” when given the option. You can also pay by credit or debit card, but you will be charged a processing fee. Doing so, though, may become much more costly than just a fee if you charge your tax payment but don’t pay your credit card bill off in full every month, since you likely pay a high interest rate on outstanding balances. If you still owe income taxes to your state, remember that you may need to go through a similar exercise of filing for an extension and making a payment to your state’s revenue department, Martin said.

1,2024-08-06 07:36:50.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-06 05:27:12.000,Retail spending fell in March as consumers pull back,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/14/economy/march-retail-sales/index.html,2023-04-14 14:29:52.000,"Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Spending at US retailers fell in March as consumers pulled back after the banking crisis fueled recession fears. Retail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation, fell by 1% in March from the prior month, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. That was steeper than an expected 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv, and above the revised 0.2% decline in the prior month. Investors chalk up some of the weakness to a lack of tax returns and concerns about a slowing labor market. The IRS issued $84 billion in tax refunds this March, about $25 billion less than they issued in March of 2022, according to BofA analysts. That led consumers to pull back in spending at department stores and on durable goods, such as appliances and furniture. Spending at general merchandise stores fell 3% in March from the prior month and spending at gas stations declined 5.5% during the same period. Excluding gas station sales, retail spending retreated 0.6% in March from February. However, retail spending rose 2.9% year-over-year. Smaller tax returns likely played a role in last month’s decline in retail sales, along with the expiration of enhanced food assistance benefits, economists say. “March is a really important month for refunds. Some folks might have been expecting something similar to last year,” Aditya Bhave, senior US economist at BofA Global Research, told CNN. Credit and debit card spending per household tracked by Bank of America researchers moderated in March to its slowest pace in more than two years, which was likely the result of smaller returns and expired benefits, coupled with slowing wage growth. Enhanced pandemic-era benefits provided through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program expired in February, which might have also held back spending in March, according to a Bank of America Institute report. Average hourly earnings grew 4.2% in March from a year earlier, down from the prior month’s annualized 4.6% increase and the smallest annual rise since June 2021, according to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Employment Cost Index, a more comprehensive measure of wages, has also shown that worker pay gains have moderated this past year. ECI data for the first quarter of this year will be released later this month. Still, the US labor market remains solid, even though it has lost momentum recently. That could hold up consumer spending in the coming months, said Michelle Meyer, North America chief economist at Mastercard Economics Institute. “The big picture is still favorable for the consumer when you think about their income growth, their balance sheet and the health of the labor market,” Meyer said. Employers added 236,000 jobs in March, a robust gain by historical standards but smaller than the average monthly pace of job growth in the prior six months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The latest monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, showed that the number of available jobs remained elevated in February — but was down more than 17% from its peak of 12 million in March 2022, and revised data showed that weekly claims for US unemployment benefits were higher than previously reported. The job market could cool further in the coming months. Economists at the Federal Reserve expect the US economy to head into a recession later in the year as the lagged effects of higher interest rates take a deeper hold. Fed economists had forecast subdued growth, with risks of a recession, prior to the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. For consumers, the effects of last month’s turbulence in the banking industry have been limited so far. Consumer sentiment tracked by the University of Michigan worsened slightly in March during the bank failures, but it had already shown signs of deteriorating before then. The latest consumer sentiment reading, released Friday morning, showed that sentiment held steady in April despite the banking crisis, but that higher gas prices helped push up year-ahead inflation expectations by a full percentage point, rising from 3.6% in March to 4.6% in April. “On net, consumers did not perceive material changes in the economic environment in April,” Joanne Hsu, director of the surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan, said in a news release. “Consumers are expecting a downturn, they’re not feeling as dismal as they were last summer, but they’re waiting for the other shoe to drop,” Hsu told Bloomberg TV in an interview Friday morning.

1,2024-08-06 07:36:50.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-06 05:27:12.000,Analysis: Fox News is about to enter the true No Spin Zone,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/14/media/fox-news-dominion-hnk-intl/index.html,2023-04-14 06:41:00.000,"Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks This is it. The media defamation trial of the century is on the precipice of kicking off in Wilmington, Delaware, in just days. Jury selection in Dominion Voting Systems’ monster $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit took place all of Thursday, with 300 potential jurors being summoned to court. Good progress was made and the presiding judge noted that there were “more than enough jurors” to start the trial as scheduled on Monday. It is there, in Courtroom 7E, where the biggest figures in Murdoch Media, accompanied by a throng of high-powered lawyers, will attempt to mount their defense after repeatedly failing to convince a judge to toss the now-historic case. A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. It’s, frankly, extraordinary to write those words. When I watched Fox News broadcast election lies in the aftermath of the 2020 election, never did I expect the network to be held accountable in a meaningful way. I’ve covered Fox News for a while now. I’ve watched thousands and thousands of hours of the right-wing channel’s programming. I’ve seen its hosts over the years undermine public health, make gross anti-immigrant remarks, peddle lies and propaganda and push deranged conspiracy theories that were once reserved for the right-wing’s furthest fringes. The network has always seemed to find a way to sail through the controversy, even the most hellish storms it has faced. Sometimes it has emerged even stronger and more emboldened than before. But this time is different. This time, the normal tricks the network turns to during times of crisis will not free it from trouble. This time, in a court of law, the network will need to put forward an honest, fact-driven argument. Fox News is about to enter the true No Spin Zone, where deception is strictly prohibited. Where it is not in charge. And where its top executives like Rupert Murdoch and Suzanne Scott and hosts like Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity cannot simply ignore a request for comment and resort to, instead, attacking “the media” on-air. In this setting, where lies cannot be casually told and truth cannot be distorted beyond reality to fit a dishonest narrative, it will be fascinating to see how the network fares. If the pre-trial hearings are any indicator, it won’t be pretty. The case hasn’t even started and the presiding judge has already lost his patience with Fox’s legal team and put them on notice. Perhaps the winds will shift for Fox News when the judge gavels in the trial on Monday. But if they play out like the last few weeks of court have, Fox News is in for a brutal ride.

1,2024-08-06 07:36:50.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-06 05:27:12.000,Silicon Valley Bank collapse renews calls to address disparities impacting entrepreneurs of color ,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/13/business/silicon-valley-bank-entrepreneurs-of-color-reaj/index.html,2023-04-13 21:13:04.000,"Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks When customers at Silicon Valley Bank rushed to withdraw billions of dollars last month, venture capitalist Arlan Hamilton stepped in to help some of the founders of color who panicked about losing access to payroll funds. As a Black woman with nearly 10 years of business experience, Hamilton knew the options for those startup founders were limited. SVB had a reputation for servicing people from underrepresented communities like hers. Its failure has reignited concerns from industry experts about lending discrimination in the banking industry and the resulting disparities in capital for people of color. Hamilton, the 43-year-old founder and managing partner of Backstage Capital, said that when it comes to entrepreneurs of color, “we’re already in the smaller house. We already have the rickety door and the thinner walls. And so, when a tornado comes by, we’re going to get hit harder.” Established in 1983, the midsize California tech lender was America’s 16th largest bank at the end of 2022 before it collapsed on March 10. SVB provided banking services to nearly half of all venture-backed technology and life-sciences companies in the United States. Hamilton, industry experts and other investors told CNN the bank was committed to fostering a community of minority entrepreneurs and provided them with both social and financial capital. SVB regularly sponsored conferences and networking events for minority entrepreneurs, said Hamilton, and it was well known for funding the annual State of Black Venture Report spearheaded by BLK VC, a nonprofit organization that connects and empowers Black investors. “When other banks were saying no, SVB would say yes,” said Joynicole Martinez, a 25-year entrepreneur and chief advancement and innovation officer for Rising Tide Capital, a nonprofit organization founded in 2004 to connect entrepreneurs with investors and mentors. Martinez is also an official member of the Forbes Coaches Council, an invitation-only organization for business and career coaches. She said SVB was an invaluable resource for entrepreneurs of color and offered their clients discounted tech tools and research funding. Minority business owners have long faced challenges accessing capital due to discriminatory lending practices, experts say. Data from the Small Business Credit Survey, a collaboration of all 12 Federal Reserve banks, shows disparities on denial rates for bank and nonbank loans. In 2021, about 16% of Black-led companies acquired the total amount of business financing they sought from banks, compared to 35% of White-owned companies, the survey shows. “We know there’s historic, systemic, and just blatant racism that’s inherent in lending and banking. We have to start there and not tip-toe around it,” Martinez told CNN. Asya Bradley is an immigrant founder of multiple tech companies like Kinley, a financial services business aiming to help Black Americans build generational wealth. Following SVB’s collapse, Bradley said she joined a WhatsApp group of more than 1,000 immigrant business founders. Members of the group quickly mobilized to support one another, she said. Immigrant founders often don’t have Social Security numbers nor permanent addresses in the United States, Bradley said, and it was crucial to brainstorm different ways to find funding in a system that doesn’t recognize them. “The community was really special because a lot of these folks then were sharing different things that they had done to achieve success in terms of getting accounts in different places. They also were able to share different regional banks that have stood up and been like, ‘Hey, if you have accounts at SVB, we can help you guys,’” Bradley said. Many women, people of color and immigrants opt for community or regional banks like SVB, Bradley says, because they are often rejected from the “top four banks” — JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citibank. In her case, Bradley said her gender might have been an issue when she could only open a business account at one of the “top four banks” when her brother co-signed for her. “The top four don’t want our business. The top four are rejecting us consistently. The top four do not give us the service that we deserve. And that’s why we’ve gone to community banks and regional banks such as SVB,” Bradley said. None of the top four banks provided a comment to CNN. The Financial Services Forum, an organization representing the eight largest financial institutions in the United States has said the banks have committed millions of dollars since 2020 to address economic and racial inequality. Last week, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told CNN’s Poppy Harlow that his bank has 30% of its branches in lower-income neighborhoods as part of a $30 billion commitment to Black and Brown communities across the country. Wells Fargo specifically pointed to its 2022 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion report, which discusses the bank’s recent initiatives to reach underserved communities. The bank partnered last year with the Black Economic Alliance to initiate the Black Entrepreneur Fund — a $50 million seed, startup, and early-stage capital fund for businesses founded or led by Black and African American entrepreneurs. And since May 2021, Wells Fargo has invested in 13 Minority Depository Institutions, fulfilling its $50 million pledge to support Black-owned banks. Black-owned banks work to close the lending gap and foster economic empowerment in these traditionally excluded communities, but their numbers have been dwindling over the years, and they have far fewer assets at their disposal than the top banks. OneUnited Bank, the largest Black-owned bank in the United States, manages a little over $650 million in assets. By comparison, JPMorgan Chase manages $3.7 trillion in assets. Because of these disparities, entrepreneurs also seek funding from venture capitalists. In the early 2010s, Hamilton intended to start her own tech company — but as she searched for investors, she saw that White men control nearly all venture capital dollars. That experience led her to establish Backstage Capital, a venture capital fund that invests in new companies led by underrepresented founders. “I said, ‘Well, instead of trying to raise money for one company, let me try to raise for a venture fund that will invest in underrepresented — and now we call them underestimated — founders who are women, people of color, and LGBTQ specifically,’ because I am all three,” Hamilton told CNN. Since then, Backstage Capital has amassed a portfolio of nearly 150 different companies and has made over 120 diversity investments, according to data from Crunchbase. But Bradley, who is also an ‘angel investor’ of minority-owned businesses, said she remains “really hopeful” that community banks, regional banks and fintechs “will all stand up and say, ‘Hey, we are not going to let the good work of SVB go to waste.’” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

In addition to water loss due to an intense multiyear drought, the US Geological Survey and the Bureau of Reclamation report found, Lake Powell faced an average annual loss in storage capacity of about 33,270 acre-feet, or 11 billion gallons, per year between 1963 and 2018. That’s enough water to fill the Reflecting Pool on the National Mall about 1,600 times. The capacity of the reservoir is shrinking because of sediments flowing in from the Colorado and San Juan rivers, according to the report. Those sediments settle at the bottom of the reservoir and decrease the total amount of water the reservoir can hold. As of Monday, Lake Powell was around 25% full, according to data from the Bureau of Reclamation. It’s bad news for a region already facing water shortages and extreme wildfires due to the drought. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration drought experts said last week these conditions are expected to at least continue – if not worsen – in the coming months. Lake Powell is an important reservoir in the Colorado River Basin. Both Lake Powell and nearby Lake Mead, the nation’s largest reservoir, have drained at an alarming rate. In August, the federal government declared a water shortage on the Colorado River for the first time after Lake Mead’s water level plunged to unprecedented lows, triggering mandatory water consumption cuts for states in the Southwest that began in January. And last week, Lake Powell dipped below the critical threshold of 3,525 feet above sea level, sparking additional concerns about water supply and hydropower generation millions of people in the West rely on for electricity. The significance of the dwindling water supply along the Colorado cannot be overstated. The system supplies water for more than 40 million people living across seven Western states and Mexico. Lakes Powell and Mead provide a critical supply of drinking water and irrigation for many across the region, including rural farms, ranches and native communities. “It is vitally important we have the best-available scientific information like this report to provide a clear understanding of water availability in Lake Powell as we plan for the future,” Tanya Trujillo, assistant secretary for water and science with the US Department of Interior, said in a statement. “The Colorado River system faces multiple challenges, including the effects of a 22-year-long drought and the increased impacts of climate change.” © 2024 Cable News Network.

The report by IQAir, a company that tracks global air quality, found that average annual air pollution in every country — and 97% of cities — exceeded the World Health Organization’s air quality guidelines, which were designed to help governments craft regulations to protect public health. Related article Not only is Lake Powell's water level plummeting because of drought, its total capacity is shrinking, too Only 222 cities of the 6,475 analyzed had average air quality that met WHO’s standard. Three territories were found to have met WHO guidelines: the French territory of New Caledonia and the United States territories of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. India, Pakistan and Bangladesh were among the countries with the worst air pollution, exceeding the guidelines by at least 10 times. The Scandinavian countries, Australia, Canada, Japan and United Kingdom ranked among the best countries for air quality, with average levels that exceeded the guidelines by 1 to 2 times. In the United States, IQAir found air pollution exceeded WHO guidelines by 2 to 3 times in 2021. “This report underscores the need for governments around the world to help reduce global air pollution,” Glory Dolphin Hammes, CEO of IQAir North America, told CNN. “(Fine particulate matter) kills far too many people every year and governments need to set more stringent air quality national standards and explore better foreign policies that promote better air quality.” Above: IQAir analyzed average annual air quality for more than 6,000 cities and categorized them from best air quality, in blue (Meets WHO PM2.5 guildline) to worst, in purple (Exceeds WHO PM2.5 guideline by over 10 times). An interactive map is available from IQAir. It’s the first major global air quality report based on WHO’s new annual air pollution guidelines, which were updated in September 2021. The new guidelines halved the acceptable concentration of fine particulate matter — or PM 2.5 — from 10 down to 5 micrograms per cubic meter. PM 2.5 is the tiniest pollutant yet also among the most dangerous. When inhaled, it travels deep into lung tissue where it can enter the bloodstream. It comes from sources like the burning of fossil fuels, dust storms and wildfires, and has been linked to a number of health threats including asthma, heart disease and other respiratory illnesses. Related article Allergy season will start much earlier than normal and be far more intense because of climate crisis, study suggests Millions of people die each year from air quality issues. In 2016, around 4.2 million premature deaths were associated with fine particulate matter, according to WHO. If the 2021 guidelines had been applied that year, WHO found there could have been nearly 3.3 million fewer pollution-related deaths. IQAir analyzed pollution-monitoring stations in 6,475 cities across 117 countries, regions and territories. In the US, air pollution spiked in 2021 compared to 2020. Out of the more than 2,400 US cities analyzed, Los Angeles air remained the most polluted, despite seeing a 6% decrease compared to 2020. Atlanta and Minneapolis saw significant increases in pollution, the report showed. “The (United States’) reliance on fossil fuels, increasing severity of wildfires as well as varying enforcement of the Clean Air Act from administration to administration have all added to U.S. air pollution,” the authors wrote. Researchers say the main sources of pollution in the US were fossil fuel-powered transportation, energy production and wildfires, which wreak havoc on the country’s most vulnerable and marginalized communities. “We are heavily dependent on fossil fuels, especially in terms of transportation,” said Hammes, who lives a few miles from Los Angeles. “We can act smartly on this with zero emissions, but we’re still not doing it. And this is having a devastating impact on the air pollution that we’re seeing in major cities.” Related article Big-box stores could help slash emissions and save millions by putting solar panels on roofs. Why aren't more of them doing it? Climate change-fueled wildfires played a significant role in reducing air quality in the US in 2021. The authors pointed to a number of fires that led to hazardous air pollution — including the Caldor and Dixie fires in California, as well as the Bootleg Fire in Oregon, which wafted smoke all the way to the East Coast in July. China — which is among the countries with the worst air pollution — showed improved air quality in 2021. More than half of the Chinese cities analyzed in the report saw lower levels of air pollution compared to the previous year. The capital city of Beijing continued a five-year trend of improved air quality, according to the report, due to a policy-driven drawdown of polluting industries in the city. The report also found that the Amazon Rainforest, which had acted as the world’s major defender against the climate crisis, emitted more carbon dioxide than it absorbed last year. Deforestation and wildfires have threatened the critical ecosystem, polluted the air and contributed to climate change. “This is all a part of the formula that will lead to or is leading to global warming.” Hammes said. The report also unveiled some inequalities: Monitoring stations remain scant in some developing countries in Africa, South America and the Middle East, resulting in a dearth of air quality data in those regions. “When you don’t have that data, you’re really in the dark,” Hammes said. Related article Could Russia's war kick-start a renewable-energy revolution? It depends where in the world you look Hammes noted the African country of Chad was included in the report for the first time, due to an improvement in its monitoring network. IQAir found the country’s air pollution was the second-highest in the world last year, behind Bangladesh. Tarik Benmarhnia, a climate change epidemiologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography who has studied the health impact of wildfire smoke, also noted that relying only on monitoring stations can lead to blind spots in these reports. “I think it is great that they relied on different networks and not only governmental sources,” Benmarhnia, who was not involved in this report, told CNN. “However, many regions do not have enough stations and alternative techniques exist.” The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded in its 2021 report that, in addition to slowing the speed of global warming, curbing the use of fossil fuels would have the added benefit of improving air quality and public health. Hammes said the IQAir report is even more reason for the world to wean off fossil fuel. “We’ve got the report, we can read it, we can internalize it and really devote ourselves to taking action,” she said. “There needs to be a major move towards renewable energy. We need to take drastic action in order to reverse the tide of global warming; otherwise, the impact and the train that we’re on (would be) irreversible.” © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

The rooftops and parking lot space available at retail giants like Walmart, Target and Costco is massive. And these largely empty spaces are being touted as untapped potential for solar power that could help the US reduce its dependency on foreign energy, slash planet-warming emissions and save companies millions of dollars in the process. At the IKEA store in Baltimore, installing solar panels on the roof and over the store’s parking lot cut the amount of energy it needed to purchase by 84%, slashing its costs by 57% from September to December of 2020, according to the company. (The panels also provide some beneficial shade to keep customers’ cars cool on hot, sunny days.) Related article Could Russia's war kick-start a renewable-energy revolution? It depends where in the world you look As of February 2021, IKEA had 54 solar arrays installed across 90% of its US locations. Big-box stores and shopping centers have enough roof space to produce half of their annual electricity needs from solar, according to a report from nonprofit Environment America and research firm Frontier Group. Leveraging the full rooftop solar potential of these superstores would generate enough electricity to power nearly 8 million average homes, the report concluded, and would cut the same amount of planet-warming emissions as pulling 11.3 million gas-powered cars off the road. The average Walmart store, for example, has 180,000 square feet of rooftop, according to the report. That’s roughly the size of three football fields and enough space to support solar energy that could power the equivalent of 200 homes, the report said. “Every rooftop in America that isn’t producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them,” Johanna Neumann, senior director for Environment America’s campaign for 100% Renewable, told CNN. “Now is the time to lean into local renewable energy production, and there’s no better place than the roofs of America’s big-box superstores.” Advocates involved in clean energy worker-training programs tell CNN that a solar revolution in big-box retail would also be a significant windfall for local communities, spurring economic growth while tackling the climate crisis, which has inflicted disproportionate harm on marginalized communities. Yet only a fraction of big-box stores in the US have solar on their rooftops or solar canopies in parking lots, the report’s authors told CNN. Related article Why record-high gas prices won't be solved by drilling more oil in the US CNN reached out to five of the top US retailers — Walmart, Kroger, Home Depot, Costco and Target — to ask: Why not invest in more rooftop solar? Many renewable energy experts point to solar as a relatively simple solution to cut down on costs and help rein in fossil fuel emissions, but the companies point to several roadblocks — regulations, labor costs and structural integrity of the rooftops themselves — that are preventing more widespread adoption. The need for these kinds of clean energy initiatives is becoming “unquestionably urgent” as the climate crisis accelerates, said Edwin Cowen, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Cornell University. “We are behind the eight ball, to put it mildly,” Cowen told CNN. “I would have loved to see policy help incentivize rooftop solar 15 years ago instead of five years ago in the commercial space. There’s still a tremendous amount of work to do.” Neumann said Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, possesses by far the largest solar potential. Walmart has around 5,000 stores in the US and more than 783 million square feet of rooftop space — an area larger than Manhattan — and more than 8,974 gigawatt hours of annual rooftop solar potential, according to the report. It’s enough electricity to power more than 842,000 homes, the report said. “Every rooftop in America that isn’t producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them.” Johanna Neumann, Environment America Walmart spokesperson Mariel Messier told CNN the company is involved in renewable energy projects around the world, but many of them are not rooftop solar installations. The company has reported having completed on- and off-site wind and solar projects or had others under development with a capacity to produce more than 2.3 gigawatts of renewable energy. Neumann said Environment America has met with Walmart a few times, urging the retailer to commit to installing solar panels on roofs and in parking lots. The company has said it’s aiming to source 100% of its energy through renewable projects by 2035. “Of all the retailers in America, Walmart stands to make the biggest impact if they put rooftop solar on all of their stores,” Neumann told CNN. “And for us, this report just underscores just how much of an impact they could make if they make that decision.” According to Environment America, Walmart had installed almost 194 megawatts of solar capacity on its US facilities as of the end of the 2021 fiscal year and additional capacity in off-site solar farms. The company’s installations in California were expected to provide between 20% to 30% of each location’s electricity needs. Target ranked No. 1 for on-site solar capacity in 2019, according to industry trade group Solar Energy Industries Association’s most recent report. It currently has 542 locations with rooftop solar — around a quarter of the company’s stores — a Target spokesperson told CNN. Rooftop solar generates enough energy to meet 15% to 40% of Target properties’ energy needs, the spokesperson said. Richard Galanti, the chief financial officer at Costco, said the company has 121 stores with rooftop solar around the world, 95 of which are in the US. Walmart, Target and Costco did not share with CNN what their biggest barriers are to adding rooftop or parking lot solar panels to more stores.  “My suspicion is that they want an even stronger business case for deviating from business-as-usual,” Neumann said. “Historically, all those roofs have done is cover their stores, and rethinking how [they] use their buildings and thinking of them as energy generators, not just protection from rain, requires a small change in their business model.” Home Depot, which has around 2,300 stores, currently has 75 completed rooftop solar projects, 12 in construction and more than 30 planned for future development, said Craig D’Arcy, the company’s director of energy management. Solar power generates around half of these stores’ energy needs on average, he said. Aging rooftops at stores are a “huge impediment” to solar installation, D’Arcy added. If a roof needs to be replaced in the next 15 to 20 years or sooner, it doesn’t make financial sense for Home Depot to add solar systems today, he said. “We have a goal of implementing solar rooftop where the economics are attractive,” D’Arcy told CNN. CNN also reached out to Kroger, which owns about 2,800 stores across the US. Kristal Howard, a Kroger spokesperson, said the company currently has 15 properties — stores, distribution centers and manufacturing plants — with solar installations. One of the “multiple factors affecting the viability of a solar installation” was the stores’ ability to support a solar installation on the roofs, Howard said. Cowen, the engineering professor at Cornell, said solar is already attractive, but that labor costs, incentives and the different layers of regulation likely pose some financial challenges in solar installations. “For them, this means usually hiring a local site firm that can do that installation that also knows local policy,” Cowen said. “It’s just another layer of complexity that I think is beginning to make sense because the costs have come down enough, but it needs kind of reopening that door of getting into an existing building.” Related article 'Delay means death': We're running out of ways to adapt to the climate crisis, new report shows. Here are the key takeaways Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois, who co-chairs the power sector task force in the House, said the US has “failed to provide the incentives to people who have the expertise to go in and build these things.” The reason both retail companies and the power sector have not made much progress on solar is because “our system is so disjointed” and has a complex regulation structure, Casten said. “Why aren’t we doing something that makes economic sense? The answer is this horribly disjointed federal policy where we massively subsidize fossil energy extraction, and we penalize clean energy production,” Casten told CNN. “For a long, long time, if you wanted to build a solar panel on the rooftop of Walmart, your biggest enemy was going to be your local utility because they didn’t want to lose the load. “We could have done this decades ago,” Casten added. “And had we done it, we would not be in this dire position with the climate, but we’d also have a lot more money in our pocket.” For Charles Callaway, director of organizing at the nonprofit group WE ACT for Environmental Justice, strengthening the rooftop solar capacity in big box retail stores is a no-brainer, especially if companies allow the local community to reap benefits either through installation jobs or sharing the electricity produced later. Either way, it would put a massive dent in curbing the climate crisis and help usher in an equitable transition away from fossil fuels — and it’s doable, Callaway told CNN. The New York City resident led a worker training program that helped train more than 100 local community members, mostly people of color, to become solar installers. He also formed a solar workers cooperative to ensure many of the participants of the training program get jobs in a tough market. In the last two years, Callaway said his group has not only installed solar panels on roofs of affordable housing units, but also equipment capable of producing 2 megawatts of solar energy on shopping malls up in upstate New York. He emphasized that hiring locally would be most beneficial since local installers know the community and local regulations best. Related article Allergy season will start much earlier than normal and be far more intense because of climate crisis, study suggests “One of my huge concerns is social equity,” Cowen said. “Access to renewable energy is a fairly privileged position these days, and we’ve got to figure out ways to make that not true.” Jasmine Graham, WE ACT’s energy justice policy manager, said the potential of building rooftop solar on big box superstores is encouraging, only “if these projects use local labor, if they are paying prevailing wages, and if this solar is being used in a manner such as community solar, which would allow [utility] bill discounts for folks that live in the same utility zone.” Pressure is mounting for global leaders to act urgently on the climate crisis after a UN report in late February warned the window for action is rapidly closing. Neumann believes the US can meet its energy demand with renewables. All it takes, she said, is the political will to make that switch, and the inclusion of the local community so no one gets left behind in the transition. “The sooner we make that transition, the sooner we’ll have cleaner air, the sooner we’ll have a more protected environment and better health and the sooner we’ll have a more livable future for our kids,” Neumann said. “And even if that requires investment, it is an investment worth making.” CNN’s Judson Jones contributed to this report. © 2024 Cable News Network.

1,2024-08-06 07:36:50.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-06 05:27:12.000,Look of the Week: Blackpink headline Coachella in Korean hanboks,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/blackpink-coachella-2023-hanboks-lotw/index.html,2023-04-18 15:39:40.000,"Editor’s Note: Featuring the good, the bad and the ugly, ‘Look of the Week’ is a regular series dedicated to unpacking the most talked about outfit of the last seven days. Bringing the second day of this year’s Coachella to a close, K-Pop girl group Blackpink made history Saturday night when they became the first Asian act to ever headline the festival. To a crowd of, reportedly, over 125,000 people, Jennie, Jisoo, Lisa and Rosé used the ground-breaking moment to pay homage to Korean heritage by arriving onstage in hanboks: a traditional type of dress. While the garments were shrugged off a few seconds into their opening track, “Pink Venom,” revealing each member’s custom black and pink Dolce and Gabbana outfit, fans across the world had already received the message. Screenshots of the moment quickly spread among Blackpink superfans, otherwise known as Blinks. “The way they stepped onto the biggest western stage in hanboks … literally proved their place at the top of the industry,” tweeted one Blink. “Blackpink really are in a league of their own.” Another called the group “Korea’s cultural delegation” on Instagram, in reference to not only the hanboks but other visual cues incorporated into their show, such as one of the stage backdrops featuring an angular tiled roof reminiscent of traditional Korean architecture. Look of the Week: Are we about to see more men in tights? In recent years, Blackpink have enjoyed a meteoric rise to global fame. According to Guinness World Records, they are currently the most streamed female group on Spotify, and have the most-viewed music YouTube channel. Last year, they were the first female K-Pop group to reach number 1 in the UK and US album charts, and in 2020 their track “How You Like That” became the most viewed video on YouTube in 24 hours. (The group also wore modernized hanboks, designed by Kim Danha, in one of the music video’s scenes.) Their landmark set over the weekend was in fact a follow-up to another milestone: In 2019, they became the first female K-Pop group to ever play at Coachella or any other US festival. From the iconic Jean Paul Gaultier cone bra worn by Madonna for her 1990 Blond Ambition tour to Geri “Ginger Spice” Halliwell’s Union Jack mini dress, the right stage costume can live on forever in public memory. Particularly when worn at a career-defining moment. During another watershed Coachella performance — Beyonce’s 2018 headline set — the singer’s custom Balmain collegiate-style yellow hoodie was a joyful nod to Black culture, specifically historically Black colleagues and universities. The group’s four black hanboks were custom created by South Korean pattern design brand OUWR and traditional Korean dressmakers Kumdanje. Inspired by the Cheol-lik silhouette, each garment was hand-embroidered with metallic traditional Korean motifs, including dan-cheong patterns and peonies (a symbol of royalty in Korea). “It was our pleasure and such an honor to be able to show the beautiful values of Korea and Hanbok together,” the designers wrote in a combined Instagram post. “Blackpink showed the beauty of Korea and dazzled the world.” In Korea, hanboks are still worn for special occasions and often seen on TV dramas. Many designers in the country have also created contemporary takes that are incorporated into everyday wear. At Seoul Fashion Week, JULYCOLUMN’s Fall-Winter 2023 collection drew on the hanbok’s voluminous silhouette to create shirts and structured jackets. Last September, Korean label BlueTamburin brought the garment to a Western audience by exclusively using traditional hanbok fabric to create its Spring-Summer 2023 collection at Milan Fashion Week. Look of the Week: 'Barbie' stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling hit the road in bubblegum pink Whether you’re a devoted Blink or not, the looks marked a moment of Asian visibility, recognition of traditional craftsmanship and a powerful example of feeling seen through fashion — representing Korean culture and symbolically embracing both its past and future. At the end of their performance, and having addressed the audience between numbers in English throughout their two-hour-long performance, Blackpink finished their set in Korean: “Until now, it has been Jennie, Jisoo, Lisa, and Rosé Blackpink. Thank you.” Top image: Blackpink performing at the first weekend of Coachella 2023, shortly after removing their hanboks. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

1,2024-08-06 07:36:50.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-06 05:27:12.000,Scientists identify secret ingredient in Leonardo da Vinci paintings,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/old-masters-da-vinci-egg-yolk-painting-scn/index.html,2023-03-30 17:43:18.000,"Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. “Old Masters” such as Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli and Rembrandt may have used proteins, especially egg yolk, in their oil paintings, according to a new study. Trace quantities of protein residue have long been detected in classic oil paintings, though they were often ascribed to contamination. A new study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications found the inclusion was likely intentional — and sheds light on the technical knowledge of the Old Masters, the most skilled European painters of the 16th, 17th, or early 18th century, and the way they prepared their paints. Scientists confirm long held theory about what inspired Monet “There are very few written sources about this and no scientific work has been done before to investigate the subject in such depth,” said study author Ophélie Ranquet of the Institute of Mechanical Process Engineering and Mechanics at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany, in a phone interview. “Our results show that even with a very small amount of egg yolk, you can achieve an amazing change of properties in the oil paint, demonstrating how it might have been beneficial for the artists.” Simply adding some egg yolk to their works, it turns out, could have long-lasting effects that went beyond just aesthetics. Compared with the medium formulated by ancient Egyptians called tempera — which combines egg yolk with powdered pigments and water — oil paint creates more intense colors, allows for very smooth color transitions and dries far less quickly, so it can be used for several days after its preparation. However, oil paint, which uses linseed or safflower oil instead of water, also has drawbacks, including being more susceptible to color darkening and damage caused by exposure to light. Because making paint was an artisanal and experimental process, it is possible that the Old Masters might have added egg yolk, a familiar ingredient, to the newer type of paint, which first showed up in the seventh century in Central Asia before spreading to Northern Europe in the Middle Ages and Italy during the Renaissance. In the study, the researchers recreated the process of paint-making by using four ingredients — egg yolk, distilled water, linseed oil and pigment — to mix two historically popular and significant colors, lead white and ultramarine blue. “The addition of egg yolk is beneficial because it can tune the properties of these paints in a drastic way,” Ranquet said, “For example by showing aging differently: It takes a longer time for the paint to oxidize, because of the antioxidants contained in the yolk.” The chemical reactions between the oil, the pigment and the proteins in the yolk directly affect the paint’s behavior and viscosity. “For example, the lead white pigment is quite sensitive to humidity, but if you coat it with a protein layer, it makes it a lot more resistant to it, making the paint quite easy to apply,” Ranquet said. “On the other hand, if you wanted something stiffer without having to add a lot of pigment, with a bit of egg yolk you can create a high impasto paint,” she added, referring to a painting technique where the paint is laid out in a stroke thick enough that the brushstrokes are still visible. Using less pigment would have been desirable centuries ago, when certain pigments — such as lapis lazuli, which was used to make ultramarine blue — were more expensive than gold, according to Ranquet. A direct evidence of the effect of egg yolk in oil paint, or lack thereof, can be seen in Leonardo da Vinci’s “Madonna of the Carnation,” one of the paintings observed during the study. Currently on display at the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, Germany, the work shows evident wrinkling on the face of Mary and the child. “Oil paint starts to dry from the surface down, which is why it wrinkles,” Ranquet said. One reason for wrinkling may be an insufficient quantity of pigments in the paint, and the study has shown that this effect could be avoided with the addition of egg yolk: “That’s quite amazing because you have the same quantity of pigment in your paint, but the presence of the egg yolk changes everything.” Because wrinkling occurs within days, it’s likely that Leonardo and other Old Masters might have caught onto this particular effect, as well as additional beneficial properties of egg yolk in oil paint, including resistance to humidity. The “Madonna of Carnation” is one of Leonardo’s earliest paintings, created at a time when he might have been still trying to master the then newly popular medium of oil paint. Another painting observed during the study was “The Lamentation Over the Dead Christ,” by Botticelli, also on display at the Alte Pinakothek. The work is mostly made with tempera, but oil paint has been used for the background and some secondary elements. “We knew that some parts of the paintings show brushstrokes that are typical for what we call an oil painting, and yet we detected the presence of proteins,” Ranquet said. “Because it’s a very small quantity and they are difficult to detect, this might be dismissed as contamination: In workshops, artists used many different things, and maybe the eggs were just from the tempera.” However, because adding egg yolk had such desirable effects on oil paint, the presence of proteins in the work might be an indication of deliberate use instead, the study suggested. Ranquet hopes that these preliminary findings might attract more curiosity toward this understudied topic. DNA analysis of Beethoven's hair reveals health issues — and a family secret Maria Perla Colombini, a professor of analytical chemistry at the University of Pisa in Italy, who was not involved in the study, agreed. “This exciting paper provides a new scenario for the understanding of old painting techniques,” she said in an email. “The research group, reporting results from molecular level up to a macroscopic scale, contributes to a new knowledge in the use of egg yolk and oil binders. They are not more looking at simply identifying the materials used by Old Masters but explain how they could produce wonderful and glittering effects by employing and mixing the few available natural materials. They try to discover the secrets of old recipes of which little or nothing is written,” she added. “This new knowledge contributes not only to a better conservation and preservation of artworks but also to a better comprehension of art history.” Top image: The “Mona Lisa” by Leonardo Da Vinci © 2024 Cable News Network.

1,2024-08-06 07:36:50.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-06 05:27:12.000,How Playboy cut ties with Hugh Hefner to create a post-MeToo brand,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/playboy-the-conversation/index.html,2023-04-11 07:10:28.000,"Editor’s Note: The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation. Hugh Hefner launched Playboy Magazine 70 years ago this year. The first issue included a nude photograph of Marilyn Monroe, which he had purchased and published without her knowledge or consent. Hefner went on to build the Playboy brand off the backs of the countless women featured in its pages, whose beauty and performance of heightened feminine sexuality have entertained its readers for generations. Approaching its 70th anniversary in December, Playboy has radically shifted. With the magazine no longer in publication, the Playboy Mansion sold to a developer and London’s last remaining Playboy Club closing in 2021, what is the future for Playboy? The brand is changing to keep up with the post-#MeToo world. Hefner passed away one month before allegations against film producer Harvey Weinstein surfaced in 2017 giving momentum to the #MeToo movement (which saw survivors of sexual assault and harassment speak out against their abusers). READ MORE: Sex, love and companionship … with AI? Why human-machine relationships could go mainstream In recent years, many have re-evaluated Hefner’s legacy and relationships with women. The 2022 docuseries “The Secrets of Playboy” (which aired on Channel 4 in the UK) detailed sexual misconduct accusations against Hefner from several ex-girlfriends, including model Sondra Theodore and TV personality Holly Madison. Hefner and Playboy’s relationship with women has been complicated. Playboy was an early supporter of abortion rights, helped fund the first rape kit and was at times an early proponent of inclusivity (for example featuring transgender model, Caroline “Tula” Cossey, in its June 1981 issue). But most women featured in Playboy have fit within a narrow beauty standard — thin, white, able-bodied and blonde. Meanwhile Hefner’s personal relationship with his much younger girlfriends reportedly followed patterns of control and emotional abuse. Ex-girlfriend Holly Madison described Hefner as treating her “like a glorified pet” in her 2015 memoir, “Down the Rabbit Hole.” Hefner’s passing meant he evaded reckoning with the #MeToo movement. Playboy, however, responded, releasing a statement in which it affirmed support for the women featured in “The Secrets of Playboy” and called Hefner’s actions “abhorrent.” The statement declared that the brand was no longer affiliated with the Hefner family and would be focusing on aspects of the company’s legacy that align with values of sex positivity and free expression. READ MORE: The ‘milf’: a brief cultural history, from Mrs Robinson to Stifler’s mom Today, Playboy is a very different company from the one Hefner launched nearly 70 years ago. Roughly 80% of Playboy staff identify as women, according the company, and its motto has changed from “Entertainment for Men” to “Pleasure for All.” Shares in the company are publicly traded and 40% of its board and management are women. The company has also moved towards more creator-led content through its app, Playboy Centerfold. Similar to subscription content service OnlyFans, Playboy Centerfold allows subscribers to view content from and interact with its creators, which it call “bunnies.” On the app, creators — or bunnies — are able portray their own bodies however they wish, putting the power back in their hands. Perhaps Playboy’s future is no longer in serving the male gaze, but instead the very audience Hefner dismissed in his first letter from the editor: “If you’re a man between the ages of 18 and 80 Playboy is meant for you … If you’re somebody’s sister, wife or mother-in-law and picked us up by mistake, please pass us along to the man in your life and get back to your Ladies Home Companion.” The stars of Playboy’s mid-2000s reality series, Holly Madison and Bridget Marquardt, are also enjoying a resurgence among fans. “The Girls Next Door” launched in 2004. The show focused on the lives of Hefner’s three girlfriends, Madison, Marquardt and Kendra Wilkinson. It became E’s best performing show and cultivated a new female audience for Playboy. “The Girls Next Door” was a story of complicated empowerment despite patriarchal interference. Its three female protagonists went from being known solely as some of Hefner’s many blonde girlfriends, to celebrities in their own right. They each ultimately broke up with Hefner, leaving the Mansion and going on to lead successful careers. The show’s depiction of Madison, Marquardt and Wilkinson as empowered, fun-loving and complex individuals, who found joy and agency through expressing their sexuality was perhaps what drew so many female fans to the show. However, amid the girls’ fight for agency, Hefner retaliated. The series shows that he maintained final say in every Playboy photograph of the girls, as well as imposing strict curfews and spending allowances. In Madison and Wilkinson’s memoirs, “Down the Rabbit Hole,” and “Sliding into Home,” they claim that production consistently undermined them. They refused to pay them for the first season, didn’t credit them until season four and aired their uncensored nude bodies in foreign broadcasts and DVD releases without consent. READ MORE: #MeToo in space: We must address the potential for sexual harassment and assault away from Earth Fan interest in “The Girls Next Door” remains strong. In August 2022 Madison and Marquardt launched their podcast “Girls Next Level,” where they interview previous playmates and interact with fans. They also recap episodes from their own points of view, unpacking their experiences of working on the show. Having reached 10 million downloads as of February 2023, the success of the podcast — 14 years after the last episode of “The Girls Next Door” — speaks to the cultural legacy of the Playboy brand. It also shows that despite Hefner’s original editor’s note, Playboy resonates with some women. Playboy is now in a post-Hefner era, where the imagery of women found within old issues of Playboy can serve as inspiration for others to enjoy their own sexuality. Whatever the future has for the company, the concept of Playboy has become public property — be that in the appearance of Playboy bunny costumes each Halloween, the popularity of cheeky Playboy logo tattoos or branded lingerie and clothing. In a post-#MeToo era, the women of Playboy are speaking up and taking over. With the mansion gates closed, the bunnies are finally reclaiming the brand as their own.

1,2024-08-06 07:36:50.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-06 05:27:12.000,'A definitive backslide.' Inside fashion's worrying runway trend,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/fashion-week-fall-winter-2023-size-diversity-skinny-wegovy/index.html,2023-04-06 20:53:38.000,"Now that the Fall-Winter 2023 catwalks have been disassembled, it’s clear one trend was more pervasive than any collective penchant for ruffles, pleated skirts or tailored coats. Across runways in New York, London, Milan and Paris, there was a notable scarcity of plus-size models. This comes at a time when there are five injectable medications which can be used as appetite suppressants currently available by prescription in the US, stirring much conversation; a sixth medication, Rybelsus, is taken as an oral pill. Two are officially approved in the UK — the largest influx of weight loss medication seen in the country in almost a decade. Dior's landmark Mumbai show signals India's growing luxury status In recent months, injectables such as Wegovy and Ozempic — which share the same active ingredient, semaglutide — have been widely reported as Hollywood’s worst-kept weight loss secret. (Ozempic is intended for use primarily to treat Type 2 diabetes.) Comedian Chelsea Handler claimed her “anti-aging doctor just hands (Ozempic) out to anybody” while appearing on a podcast in January. Even Elon Musk tweeted last year about being on Wegovy. For many fashion commentators and diversity advocates, the Fall-Winter 2023 runways were in sharp contrast to the (albeit limited) progress and heady promise of recent seasons. This rollback has been widely criticized in the style media as such. And its potential impact is being assessed more broadly: With the rise of these weight loss panaceas, the pursuit of size zero is now just a prescription away. In 2020, Jill Kortleve and Paloma Elsesser became the first models outside of a sample size to walk for the Italian fashion house Fendi. (Traditionally, a sample size falls between a US 0-4.) British label Erdem entered the plus-size market in 2021, extending its offering to a UK size 22 (or US size 18). And in January 2022, Valentino made headlines after its haute couture show featured a broad spectrum of body types. But this season, there was a visible lack of curve bodies on their runways — or many others. Fendi and Valentino did not respond when contacted by CNN, while Erdem declined to comment. According to fashion search engine Tagwalk, the number of mid and plus-size models dropped by 24% in comparison to Spring-Summer 2023. Similarly, a size inclusivity report conducted by Vogue Business found that 95.6% of all looks presented for Fall-Winter 2023 were in a size US 0-4. For context, industry market firm Plunkett Research estimated in 2015 that 68% of American women wear a size US 14 or above. “It was a definitive backslide,” said IMG model agent Mina White, who represents plus-size and curve supermodels including Elsesser and Ashley Graham. “It was frustrating to see some of these designers not using curved bodies where they had in the past.” Fendi and Valentino did not respond when contacted by CNN, while Erdem declined to comment. “Watching somebody like Ashley Graham attend the front row for so many of these major houses in full looks (provided by the designer), it was frustrating,” White continued. “They wanted to utilize her image and her social following to command a certain space in the market, but they didn’t want to be reflective on their runways.” For others, even the term “backslide” was too generous. “Slipping back from… what? A glorious time when the average American woman (size 16) was as present on the runways as she is in everyday life? A time when fashion ads cast as many ‘plus-size’ and ‘mid-size’ women as ‘straight-size’ women?” fashion journalist Amy Odell wrote in her Substack newsletter of this past season’s runways. “No one needed any data to understand that representing a wide array of body shapes and sizes in runway shows or in fashion imagery is not a priority for the industry.” That said, a handful of — mostly smaller — brands pushed ahead this season. In London, emerging labels Di Petsa, Karoline Vitto and Sinead O’Dwyer showcased lineups of size-diverse models. Inclusivity at Christian Siriano, Coach, Kim Shui, Collina Strada and Bach Mai stood out in New York; while in Paris, Belgian brand Esther Manas — a consistent flag-bearer for size diversity — staged one of the city’s most refreshing runways with an assortment of fun, sensual, feminine looks that complimented a range of bodies. There was also a smattering of mid- and plus-size castings to be seen elsewhere: Off-White and Michael Kors, for example, featured a few such models. At Harris Reed’s debut for Nina Ricci, Precious Lee opened the show — which also featured three more plus- and mid-size models. Fashion samples and sample size pieces are one-off garments made before an item is mass-produced, typically to be worn during runway shows. Prioritizing the same body type in sample sizes means runway models are more easily interchangeable, saving fashion houses time and money if someone were to drop out or get sick during or after the casting process for a show. It’s also partly why, according to White, casting curve models is still an uphill battle. She says she introduces brands to new faces months in advance of runway season, with their specific measurements up-top and easy to read in all correspondence. “I want to be ahead of that,” White said. “So I’m never told ‘Oh, we wanted to make it work, but we didn’t have her size’ or whatever that conversation might look like.” Look of the Week: What Pope Francis' AI puffer coat says about the future of fashion But despite her efforts, she says she’s frequently told it’s too much of a “financial lift” to make larger samples — even by legacy brands. “I get very upset when brands say that,” White said. “I don’t believe that it is, I believe that it’s people not being properly educated on how to do this right.” Beyond the lack of representation, White notes it’s painful for plus-size consumers to watch brands leverage resources to create custom, made-to-fit pieces for celebrities — all the while claiming the pot is empty for more inclusive runway samples. London-based stylist and editor Francesca Burns agrees sample sizes are part of the problem. In 2020, Burns went viral after she posted on Instagram about a fashion job gone wrong. She says she was sent five looks to style from Celine, none of which fit the size UK 8 (US 4) model booked for the shoot— an 18-year-old on her first job in the business. The experience left her “horrified,” Burns told CNN, recalling what she saw as the model’s shame and embarrassment. “Looking into this girl’s eyes,” Burns said, “she shouldn’t have felt like that.” Burns’ post, which called the current system “unacceptable,” was picked up widely in the fashion media. (When reached by CNN, Celine declined to comment on the incident.) “Ultimately, the desire to see change has to be there,” Burns said. “And I wonder whether luxury has that desire?” Progress has been slow, but not entirely inexistent. Across fashion campaigns, magazine covers and editorial shoots, there is a growing enthusiasm for inclusivity. “I see the options rolling in for the plus-sized talent, and they’re great offerings,” said White. “Great, strong editorials and covers and campaigns. But I do feel like without the clothes, we are going to go back to see more naked curve stories, or lingerie curve stories or a curve girl in a trench coat. That’s what I don’t want.” For British Vogue’s April issue, unveiled March 16, Elsesser, Lee and Jill Kortleve were dubbed “The New Supers.” Preceding the cover story is a letter written by editor-in-chief, Edward Enninful commending the models for “leading the way” and holding “powerful space” in the industry. “Catwalks are once again under scrutiny for a stark lack of body diversity,” read the magazine’s Instagram caption, unveiling the cover. “But this cover was not conceived as a statement. It is a crowning of an all-powerful trio, the supermodels for a new generation.” But many online were quick to point out the disconnect: Two of the Saint Laurent Spring-Summer 2023 dresses were modeled by plus-size women, though they are not available to buy in most plus sizes. In his own social media post, Enninful wrote about his disappointment at the Fall-Winter 2023 runways. “I thought I had gotten into a time machine. Show after show dominated by one body type, so many limited visions of womanhood… one prescribed notion of beauty prevailed again, and it felt like the reality of so many women around the world were being ignored.” But for White, the power rests within the entire industry — not just at the feet of brands. “I really do believe there should be an industry standard between the (Council of Fashion Designers of America), the British Fashion Council and key editors at some of these major mass market magazines,” she continued. “If there was a call-to-action from these figureheads saying, moving forward samples need to be readily available for a few different body types, we would see significant and impactful change.” Burns agrees there must be a trickle-down effect. “I think a lot of responsibility is put on young designers to solve all these issues around sustainability or issues around body inclusivity,” she said. “It’s important that the big powerhouses, which have the capacity to action change, really take some responsibility.” On March 8, Wegovy — developed primarily as a treatment for those living with obesity and weight-related conditions — was approved in the UK. It’s the second injectable weight management medication to be made available with a prescription via the country’s National Health Service (NHS) in about 3 years, after almost a decade of quiet. Before 2020, the last weight loss medication was approved in the UK was in 2010. Similarly, the US has now approved three weight management injections: Wegovy, Saxenda and IMCIVREE. Medications for type-2 diabetes like Mounjaro and Ozempic are not FDA-approved for weight loss, though some doctors are issuing them at their own discretion. While these medicines are a revolutionary tool for those who struggle to lose weight for genetic or medical reasons, they are at risk of being abused. Semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic, was originally developed for treating type-2 diabetes. It quells hunger signals to the brain by mimicking the hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). “It can slow how quickly your stomach empties out and may give you a little more feeling of feeling full,” said Dr. Robert Lash, an endocrinologist and Chief Medical Officer of the Endocrine Society in Washington, D.C. In clinical trials, over a period of 68 weeks, participants who used the medication in conjunction with eating fewer calories and increasing their physical activity on average lost around 15% of their body weight compared to 2.4% of those using a placebo, according to the manufacturer Novo Nordisk. On March 13, the European Medicines Agency issued a statement warning of an Ozempic shortage that could continue through the year, urging doctors to prioritize prescriptions to diabetics. “Any other use, including for weight management, represents off-label use and currently places the availability of Ozempic for the indicated population at risk,” read the release. Patients typically need a BMI of 27 or higher (along with another weight-related condition like high blood pressure or diabetes) or have a genetic predisposition towards obesity to be prescribed such appetite suppressant medication by their doctor. But talk of these injectables has been sweeping the West. In January, the New York Times reported on the term “Ozempic Face,” coined by a New York-based dermatologist who reported treating several patients with a hollowed-out appearance that can come with rapid weight loss. By the end of February, the medication had made it to the cover of New York Magazine in a feature titled “Life After Food?” Adverts for GLP-1 injections are even blanketing New York City subway stations. And across social media, online forums and private group chats, some people looking to lose weight for primarily aesthetic purposes are searching for a way to skirt the requirements. “I was just looking for a way to lose a few pounds, like 10 to 15 at most,” said one 30-year-old American woman, who wished to remain anonymous, in a phone interview. She scoured social media and forums for guidance on securing a weight loss drug. “I’m certainly a normal BMI, I just have a trip to Mexico coming up and I want to look really good,” she said. Although she says she found a way to access Wegovy, she decided against the medication after considering the cost (which can reach more than $1,000 a month without insurance). “I’ve always very much fit the societal standard but lately I was just like f*ck it, I want to be skinny,” she told CNN. Dr. Lash emphasized the importance of taking weight loss drugs only with medical supervision and a valid prescription. “If somebody was a normal weight and they took this drug because they thought they could be even thinner than they are now, that could lead to complications,” he told CNN, warning of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and even gallbladder problems. “These drugs are not benign, they do have side effects involving the GI tract. There’s no such thing as a free lunch.” Fashion has long promoted size 0 as the ultimate virtue — regardless of its viability for many people, or any health risks. And now with the accessibility of accelerated weight loss medication, the stakes are even higher. For Burns and White, the industry is responsible for amplifying a new, more inclusive vision of beauty. “There’s a very archaic way of looking at women over a size 16 and just assuming that they’re unhealthy or uneducated or unstylish. Or don’t have the resources to buy into luxury,” said White. “The reality is the same women these brands are alienating in their fashion space are the same women running out to buy their handbags, shoes, perfumes, cosmetics and skincare.” Not only do designers need to create clothes with this consumer in mind, according to White, but they need to be seen on the runway, too. “It shouldn’t be a conversation. It should just be normalized that we’re not just looking at a single view of beauty,” echoed Burns. Ester Manas and Balthazar Delepierre, whose bridal-inspired Fall-Winter 2023 collection was one of this season’s most size-diverse runways, summarized it best in their accompanying show notes: “The body is not the subject. Because, obviously, at a wedding, everybody is invited. And all to the party. That is where the designer duo Ester and Balthazar take their stand.” © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

In 1998, Michael Jordan laced up a pair of his iconic black and red Air Jordan 13s to bring home a Bulls victory during Game 2 of his final NBA championship — and now they are the most expensive sneakers ever to sell at auction.The game-winning sneakers sold for $2.2 million at Sotheby’s in New York on Tuesday, smashing the sneaker auction record of $1.47 million, set in 2021 by a pair of Nike Air Ships that Jordan wore earlier in his career. Remember when Dennis Rodman put on a wedding dress and claimed to marry himself? The sale arrives during “Jordan Year” — a reference to the NBA star player’s iconic jersey number 23. In January, Air Jordan partnered with Sotheby’s to auction off 13 pairs of retro sneakers that were designed in memory of The Notorious B.I.G. All lots outsold their high estimates of $5,000 by multiples, with the highest selling for more than $32,000. Last year, Jordan’s Game 1 jersey, also from the 1998 finals, became the most expensive item of worn sports memorabilia to sell at auction when it fetched $10.1 million at a Sotheby’s sale. Jordan’s farewell run with the Chicago Bulls is often referred to as “The Last Dance,” after the title of an ESPN and Netflix documentary that chronicled the season. Jordan announced his (second) retirement weeks before the finals, leading to the six-game series against the Utah Jazz becoming the most-watched in NBA history, based on Nielsen TV ratings. (Jordan would later return from 2001 to 2003 to play with the Washington Wizards, but did not win another championship). “Michael Jordan game-worn sports memorabilia has proven time and time again to be the most elite and coveted items on the market,” said Brahm Wachter, Sotheby’s head of streetwear and modern collectables, in a press release prior to the sale. “However, items from his ‘Last Dance’ season are of a greater scale and magnitude as seen with our record-breaking sale of his Game 1 jersey in 2022.” The pair of sneakers sold Tuesday were worn during Game 2, in Salt Lake City, which the Bulls won 93-88 after losing Game 1, with Jordan scoring 37 points. They are the last pair of black and red Air Jordan 13s that Jordan ever wore on the court for an NBA game, a press release from Sotheby’s noted. 13 of the best menswear looks from Oscars history Following Game 2, Jordan signed and gifted the set of worn shoes to the ball boy in the visitor’s locker room, as he was known to do, according to Sotheby’s. The Air Jordan 13 sneakers starred in a sports memorabilia sale called “Victoriam,” which featured items worn by athletes including Tom Brady, Kobe Bryant and Roger Federer. Several other Jordan items were included in the two-part auction, with a game-worn 1998 Bulls jersey and a pair of 1985 Air Jordan 1s fetching $508,000 and $127,000 respectively. Other top lots included one of Kobe Bryant’s LA Lakers shooting shirts, which sold for over $406,000, and a soccer jersey, worn by the late Pelé on his debut for the New York Cosmos in 1975, that sold fetched over $177,000.

1,2024-08-06 07:36:50.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-06 05:27:12.000,The surreal facades of America's strip clubs,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/francois-prost-gentlemens-club/index.html,2023-03-06 14:13:40.000,"Some people travel the world in search of adventure, while others seek out natural wonders, cultural landmarks or culinary experiences. But French photographer François Prost was looking for something altogether different during his recent road trip across America: strip clubs. From Miami to Los Angeles, Prost’s latest book “Gentlemen’s Club” charts his route across the US via nearly 150 strip clubs with names like Pleasures, Temptations and Cookies N’ Cream. There isn’t a single nude woman to be seen, however, as Prost’s camera was exclusively trained on the buildings themselves — and specifically their often-colorful facades. Over the course of five weeks in 2019 he traversed over 6,000 miles, with the resulting photos capturing everything from the pastel hues of Florida’s Club Pink Pussycat to venues hiding in plain sight in the country’s more religious states. “I’d divide these venues into two types: One is very integrated into the public landscape, and one is a bit more hidden and dodgy,” Prost said, speaking to CNN on a video call and email. The first type, he added, could be found in “very American” settings, such as “around amusement parks and fast food and malls.” The latter venues, however, would sometimes look indistinguishable from any store in a strip mall. Prost said he found many such establishments along the Bible Belt, a socially conservative region in the country’s south. He was especially keen to explore the area due to the apparent contrast between the prevalence of strip clubs and what he describes in his book as “conservatism and extreme puritanism.” Prost insisted that he had little interest in the interiors or services of the strip clubs, which he always visited during the day. Instead, he hoped to learn more about American culture by creating objective, documentary-style photographs of establishments sitting at the intersection of sex, gender and commerce. Documenting changing attitudes toward sex through the lens of architecture, he added that the series was primarily of a landscape photography project. Artful photos inside Houston's ONYX strip club tell a story of beauty and confidence “The prism of this theme of strip club facades became a way of studying and trying to understand the country,” he wrote in “Gentlemen’s Club,” photographs from which will feature in an exhibition in Tokyo in March. ”(‘Gentlemen’s Club’ is) an objective panorama of dominant opinions and gender and the sexualization of the feminine image.” The genesis of Prost’s project dates back to his 2018 series, “After Party,” which focused on the flamboyant facades of French nightclubs. He said that people frequently commented that the buildings’ exteriors looked as though they had been ripped straight out of American cities, sparking the idea that he should visit the US and extend the project. As he meticulously planned his trip, he was struck not only by the sheer volume of strip clubs in America but that — unlike In Europe — they often demanded to be seen. Hot pink walls, gigantic nude silhouettes and even candy-cane-striped storefronts made no secret of the kind of entertainment provided inside. From Brutalist Boston to Modernist Palm Springs, America's most eye-catching city halls “A good example would be Las Vegas, where strip clubs are everywhere and their signs blink as much as a fast food (restaurant) or casino sign,” Prost said. Miami’s clubs were often painted in vivid, Wes Anderson-esque hues. Other photos show brightly covered venues contrasting with their sparse desert surroundings. If the establishments were open during the day, Prost would enter and ask for permission to take photos in order “to not look suspicious… and explain what my intentions were,” he said. The interiors rarely lived up to the tantalizing promises plastered across the signs outside, but the photographer met a host of characters during his five-week trip, from indifferent bouncers to managers who were thrilled about the project. “Most of the time, people were OK — 99% of them would say yes to a facade picture,” he said, adding they typically wouldn’t mind his presence, as long as he didn’t take photos of patrons or dancers. “Some would think that it was a bit strange, some would be really excited about it and give me their business card to send me the picture when it was done,” he said. Prost said his biggest surprise, however, was how “normalized” strip clubs appeared to be in everyday life. As he reflects in his book, “The relationship that Americans seem to have with strip clubs is quite different to what you see in Europe. Going to a strip club seems to be a lot more normalized … You go as a couple, or amongst friends at night to have fun.” Giant doughnuts and a shoe you can walk into: California's strangest buildings He was struck, for instance, by the fact that so many Las Vegas strip clubs doubled as restaurants — with many boasting happy hour deals, buffets and special discounts for truck drivers or construction workers. “I noticed a few strip clubs that would advertise being a strip club and steakhouse, so you could eat a big piece of meat (while) watching strippers. That is also something that seems very American to me,” he said, adding: “I heard from some people I met in Portland there are even strip clubs (that offer) vegan food.” The facades are littered with jokes like “My sex life is like the Sahara, 2 palms, no dates” and pun-based names like Booby Trap and Bottoms Up. Prost’s documentarian approach heightens the signs’ surreal comedy. But it also doubles as a neutral lens through which viewers can make up their own minds about the objectification of women. By honing in on the faceless dancing bodies of female silhouettes and the quintessential “girls girls girls” signs, “Gentleman’s Club” explores the commodification of women who are, in reality, completely absent in Prost’s works (an observation reflected in the book’s title, which is a phrase that crops up numerous times on signs throughout his photographs). The strip clubs he visited market women as things to be consumed, from the many food-themed names to an advertisement reading, “1,000’s of beautiful girls & three ugly ones.” For his next project, Prost plans to visit Japan to document the nation’s love hotels, which occupy a similar role as strip clubs in some parts of the US: open secrets in a conservative society. But the photographer believes the American establishments he visited say something unique about the country — something that is less about sexuality and more about the American dream. Museum of Sex to open new outpost in Miami What his project has shown him is, he said, this: “As long as you’re successful in terms of business, (it doesn’t matter) if your activity deals with sex.” “Gentlemen’s Club” will be exhibited at Agnes b. Galerie Boutique in Tokyo, Japan, between March 17 and April 15, 2023. The book, published by Fisheye Editions, is available now. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

1,2024-08-06 07:36:50.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-06 05:27:12.000,Here's the real reason to turn on airplane mode when you fly,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/airplane-mode-reasons-why/index.html,2023-04-07 12:52:23.000,"Editor’s Note: The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation. We all know the routine by heart: “Please ensure your seats are in the upright position, tray tables stowed, window shades are up, laptops are stored in the overhead bins and electronic devices are set to flight mode.” Now, the first four are reasonable, right? Window shades need to be up so we can see if there’s an emergency, such as fire. Tray tables need to be stowed and seats upright so we can get out of the row quickly. Laptops can become projectiles in an emergency, as the seat back pockets are not strong enough to contain them. And mobile phones need to be set to flight mode so they can’t cause an emergency for the airplane, right? Well, it depends whom you ask. Aviation navigation and communication relies on radio services, which has been coordinated to minimize interference since the 1920s. The digital technology currently in use is much more advanced than some of the older analog technologies we used even 60 years ago. Research has shown personal electronic devices can emit a signal within the same frequency band as the aircraft’s communications and navigation systems, creating what is known as electromagnetic interference. Half of the world's 10 busiest airports for 2022 are in one country But in 1992, the US Federal Aviation Authority and Boeing, in an independent study, investigated the use of electronic devices on aircraft interference and found no issues with computers or other personal electronic devices during non-critical phases of flight. (Takeoffs and landings are considered the critical phases.) The US Federal Communications Commission also began to create reserved frequency bandwidths for different uses – such as mobile phones and aircraft navigation and communications – so they do not interfere with one another. Governments around the globe developed the same strategies and policies to prevent interference problems with aviation. In the EU, electronic devices have been allowed to stay on since 2014. What's the safest seat on a plane? We asked an aviation expert Why then, with these global standards in place, has the aviation industry continued to ban the use of mobile phones? One of the problems lies with something you may not expect – ground interference. Wireless networks are connected by a series of towers; the networks could become overloaded if passengers flying over these ground networks are all using their phones. The number of passengers that flew in 2021 was over 2.2 billion, and that’s half of what the 2019 passenger numbers were. The wireless companies might have a point here. Of course, when it comes to mobile networks, the biggest change in recent years is the move to a new standard. Current 5G wireless networks – desirable for their higher speed data transfer – have caused concern for many within the aviation industry. Radio frequency bandwidth is limited, yet we are still trying to add more new devices to it. The aviation industry points out that the 5G wireless network bandwidth spectrum is remarkably close to the reserved aviation bandwidth spectrum, which may cause interference with navigation systems near airports that assist with landing the aircraft. Airport operators in Australia and the US have voiced aviation safety concerns linked to 5G rollout, however it appears to have rolled out without such problems in the European Union. Either way, it is prudent to limit mobile phone use on planes while issues around 5G are sorted out. Most airlines now provide customers with Wi-Fi services that are either pay-as-you-go or free. With new Wi-Fi technologies, passengers could theoretically use their mobile phones to make video calls with friends or clients in-flight. On a recent flight, I spoke with a cabin attendant and asked her opinion on phone use during flights. It would be an inconvenience for cabin crew to wait for passengers to finish their call to ask them if they would like any drinks or something to eat, she stated. On an airliner with 200+ passengers, in-flight service would take longer to complete if everyone was making phone calls. For me, the problem with in-flight use of phones is more about the social experience of having 200+ people on a plane, and all potentially talking at once. In a time when disruptive passenger behaviour, including “air rage”, is increasingly frequent, phone use in flight might be another trigger that changes the whole flight experience. Disruptive behaviours take on various forms, from noncompliance to safety requirements such as not wearing seat belts, verbal altercations with fellow passengers and cabin crew, to physical altercations with passengers and cabin crews – typically identified as air rage. In conclusion – in-flight use of phones does not currently impair the aircraft’s ability to operate. But cabin crews may prefer not to be delayed in providing in-flight service to all of the passengers – it’s a lot of people to serve. However, 5G technology is encroaching on the radio bandwidth of aircraft navigation systems; we’ll need more research to answer the 5G question regarding interference with aircraft navigation during landings. Remember that when we are discussing the two most critical phases of flight, takeoffs are optional – but landings are mandatory.

1,2024-08-06 07:36:50.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-06 05:27:12.000,"'I was up to my waist down a hippo's throat.' He survived, and here's his advice",https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/hippo-attack-avoid-survive-paul-templer/index.html,2023-04-12 12:44:43.000,"Paul Templer was living his best life. He was 28 and conducting tours in his native Zimbabwe, with a focus on photographic safaris. He had been away for a few years, including a stint in the British army. But he had returned to Africa’s bush country “and fell back in love with it. The wildlife, the flora, the fauna, the great outdoors, the space – just everything about it. I was at home.” Templer said Zimbabwe’s guide certification program was rigorous, and there was a lot of pride among the guides who passed. He reveled in showing tourists the area’s majestic wildlife – including the water-loving, very territorial hippos. “It was idyllic,” he told CNN Travel. “Life was really, really good – until one day I had a really bad day at the office.” March 9, 1996. A Saturday. Templer learned a good friend who was to lead a canoe safari down the Zambezi River had malaria. He agreed to take his pal’s place. “I loved that stretch of the river. It was an area I know like the back of my hand.” The expedition consisted of six safari clients (four Air France crewmembers and a couple from Germany), three apprentice guides plus Templer. They had three canoes – clients in the first two seats and a guide in the back. Then one apprentice guide was in a one-person safety kayak. And down the famed Zambezi they went. “Things were going the way they were supposed to go. Everyone was having a pretty good time.” Eventually, they came across a pod of about a dozen hippos. That’s not unexpected on the Zambezi, Africa’s fourth-longest river. They weren’t alarmed at first as they were at a safe distance. But “we were getting closer, and I was trying to take evasive action. … The idea was let’s just paddle safely around the hippos.” Templer’s canoe led the way, with the other two canoes and kayak to follow. He pulled into a little channel waiting on the others. But the third canoe had fallen back from the group and was off the planned course. Templer’s not sure how that happened. Suddenly, there’s this big thud. And I see the canoe, like the back of it, catapulted up into the air. Paul Templer “Suddenly, there’s this big thud. And I see the canoe, like the back of it, catapulted up into the air. And Evans, the guide in the back of the canoe, catapulted out of the canoe.” The clients managed to remain in the canoe somehow. “Evans is in the water, and the current is washing Evans toward a mama hippo and her calf 150 meters [490 feet] away. … So I know I’ve got to get him out quickly. I don’t have time to drop my clients off.” He yells to Ben, one of the other guides, to retrieve the clients who were in the canoe that had been attacked. Ben got the clients to safety on a rock in the middle of the river that hippos couldn’t climb. Meanwhile, Templer turned his canoe around to get Evans. The plan was to pull alongside of him and pull him into Templer’s canoe. “I was paddling towards him … getting closer, and I saw this bow wave coming towards me. If you’ve ever seen any of those old movies with a torpedo coming toward a ship, it was kind of like that. I knew it was either a hippo or a really large crocodile coming at me,” he said. “But I also knew that if I slapped the blade of my paddle on water … that’s really loud. And the percussion underwater seems to turn the animals away,” he said. “So I slapped the water, and as it was supposed to do, the torpedo wave stops.” He was getting closer to Evans, but they were also getting closer to the female and calf. “I’m leaning over – it’s kind of a made-for-Hollywood movie – Evans is reaching up. … Our fingers almost touched. And then the water between us just erupted. Happened so fast I didn’t see a thing.” What happened next was nightmarish and surreal. “My world went dark and strangely quiet.” Templer said it took a few seconds to figure out what was going on. “From the waist down, I could feel the water. I could feel I was wet in the river. From my waist up, it was different. I was warm, and it wasn’t wet like the river, but it wasn’t dry either. And it was just incredible pressure on my lower back. I tried to move around; I couldn’t. “I realized I was up to my waist down a hippo’s throat.” There’s a good reason a fully grown hippopotamus can fit a large portion of a fully grown adult in its mouth. Hippos can grow up to 16.5 feet long (5 meters), 5.2 feet tall (1.6 meters) and weigh up to 4.5 tons (4 metric tonnes), according to National Geographic. They sport enormous mouths and can open their strong jaws to 150 degrees. Their teeth might be the most frightening thing of all. Their molars are used for eating plants, but their sharp canines, which might reach 20 inches (51 centimeters), are for defense and fighting. Their bite is almost three times stronger than that of a lion. One bite from a hippo can possibly cut a human body in half. They’re found naturally in various parts sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in East and Southern Africa, living in or near rivers and other water sources. (And they are an invasive species in Colombia thanks to escapees from drug lord Pablo Escobar’s menagerie). Hippos are very territorial and might aggressively attack any animal encroaching on their territory, including hyenas, lions and crocodiles. They also kill people. That we know for sure. Many internet sources say around 500 a year, but an exact figure is still uncertain because some attacks and deaths come in very remote regions and don’t get reported. “The question I get asked the most when people find out I study hippos is: ‘Is it true hippos kill more people than any animal?’ Rebecca Lewison, conservation ecologist and associate professor at San Diego State University, told CNN Travel in an email interview. How to survive a cobra bite -- or better yet, avoid one entirely “I’m not entirely sure where that started but … there is no authority or reliable data. People are surprised that hippos kill people. They look slow, and they are mostly in water. There are some nonfatal interactions, but people (or hippos) tend to fare badly from interactions.” Dr. Philip Muruthi, chief scientist and vice president of species conservation and science of the African Wildlife Foundation, said the AWF doesn’t have a credible source on the number of attacks or fatalities either. While more stats need to be collected, one study found that the probability of being killed by a hippopotamus attack is in the range of 29% to 87% – higher than that of a grizzly bear attack at 4.8%, shark attack at 22.7% and crocodile attack at 25%. Those were rather bad odds of survival working against Templer. “I’m guessing I was wedged so far down its throat it must have been uncomfortable because he spat me out. So I burst to the surface, sucked a lungful of fresh air and I came face to face with Evans, the guide who I was trying to rescue. And I said, ‘We got to get out of here!’ ” So once again, I’m up to my waist down the hippo’s throat. But this time, my legs are trapped but my hands are free. Paul Templer But Evans was in serious trouble. Templer started swimming back for him “and I was just moving in for your classic lifesaver’s hold when – WHAM! – I got hit from below. So once again, I’m up to my waist down the hippo’s throat. But this time my legs are trapped but my hands are free.” He tried to go for his gun, but he was being thrashed around so much he couldn’t grab it. The hippo – which turned out to be an older, aggressive male – spat Templer out a second time. “This time when I come to the surface I look around, there’s no sign of Evans.” Templer assumed Evans had been rescued, and he tried to escape himself. “I’m making pretty good progress and I’m swimming along there and I come up for the stroke and swimming freestyle and I look under my arm – and until my dying day I’ll remember this – there’s this hippo charging in towards me with his mouth wide open bearing in before he scores a direct hit.” This time, Templer was sideways in the hippo’s mouth, legs dangling out one side of the mouth, shoulders and head on the other side of its mouth. “And then he just goes berserk. … When hippos are fighting, the way they fight is they try to tear apart and just destroy whatever it is they’re attacking,” Templer said. “For me, fortunately everything was happening in slow motion. So when he’d go under water, I’d hold my breath. When we were on the surface, I would take a deep breath and I would try to hold onto tusks that were boring through me” to stop from being ripped apart. Templer said one of the clients watching the horror later described it like a “vicious dog trying to rip apart a rag doll.” He figures the whole attack took about three and a half minutes. Meanwhile, apprentice guide Mack in the safety kayak – “showing incredible bravery, risking his life to save mine – pulls his boat in inches from my face.” Templer managed to grab a handle on the kayak, and “Mack dragged me to the relative safety of this rock.” The expedition was still in one hell of a mess, though. People living near hippo territory are more likely victims of attacks than tourists, said Lewison. “Most of the attacks happen in the water, but because hippos raid crops on farms, there are also attacks on people trying to protect their crops. There are some tourists, but largely the attacks are happening to local residents,” Lewison said. Human encroachment from Africa’s booming population makes matters worse, increasing the chances of deadly interactions, she said. You encounter a bear in the wild. Do you know what to do next? Despite the encounters gone bad, sub-Saharan Africa depends on hippos. “Hippos are important ecosystem engineers of the ecology of freshwater areas they inhabit. This is through nutrient recycling from dung (they consume large amounts of vegetation),” Muruthi said. “Hippos attack not to eat people, but to get them the hell away from them,” Lewison said. “I don’t think hippos are particularly aggressive, but I think when under pressure, they attack.” Back on the rock in the Zambezi, Templer asked Mack where Evans was. Mack said, “He’s gone, man, he’s just gone.” Templer knew he needed to come up with a plan to get them off the rock and to the riverbank, but “first I needed to settle myself down.” He assessed the situation: One man missing. The first aid kit, radio and gun all gone. Six scared clients, two canoes and one paddle left. And his own body was shattered. “My left foot was especially bad; it looked as if someone had tried to beat a hole through it with a hammer.” He couldn’t move his arms. One arm from elbow down was “crushed to a pulp.” Blood was bubbling out of his mouth. They realized his lung was punctured. Mack rolled Templer over and could see a gaping hole in his back and plugged it with Saran Wrap from a plate of snacks. Templer made the call: No matter the risk, they had to get off that rock. He was loaded into a canoe. Ben paddled. The hippo kept bumping the canoe. He went from being terrified to calm on that ride back. He described “a profound spiritual experience in which I had this incredible sense of peace and realization this was my moment of choice. Like do I go, or do I stay? Do I close my eyes and drift off, or do I fight my way through this and stick around?” It was so intense I thought I was going to die, and when I didn’t, I kind of wished I would. Paul Templer on the pain after the attack “I chose to stick around, and as soon as I made that choice, it was more pain than I could ever imagine I could endure. It was so intense I thought I was going to die, and when I didn’t, I kind of wished I would.” Ben and Templer made it out of the river, but without finding Evans. His body was found three days later. They concluded he had drowned because he didn’t have any signs of animal attack on him. “Evans did nothing wrong. The fact that he died was purely a tragedy.” Meanwhile, some people on shore had realized something was wrong in the river. A well-trained Zimbabwe rescue team was able to safely ferry everyone else off the rock. “And that was my bad day at the office.” Templer was out of the river but not out of the woods. It took eight hours to drive him to the nearest hospital. In a month’s time, he had several major surgeries. He thought he would lose one leg and both arms. His surgeon didn’t think he’d live. But not only did the surgeon save Templer’s life, he saved his legs and one arm. The other arm, however, was beyond salvation. If you're attacked by an alligator, here's how to fight for your life He realized that in the ICU when he woke up and was feeling for his left hand. It was gone. “I just remember feeling devastated. I spent my whole life being active and it was almost more than I could bare.” But then he was flooded with relief to realize his right arm and legs had been saved. For the next month, he was “emotionally all over the map.” He got physical and occupational therapy in Zimbabwe and then more in the United Kingdom. He got a prosthesis “and then just started trying to get back to life.” Templer, Muruthi and Lewison all say safe outings start with education – and avoiding trouble in the first place. “Hippos have no interest in dealing with people. Stay away from them, and they will leave you alone. They are not hunting humans,” Lewison said. “Do not get close to them,” Muruthi said. “They don’t want any intrusion. … They’re not predators; it’s by accident if they’re injuring people.” Want close-up views and photos of the creatures? Instead of venturing too close, invest in good binoculars and telephoto camera lenses. Follow the rules. If you are a tourist, and it says ‘Stay in your vehicle,’ then stay in your vehicle. Philip Muruthi on avoiding hippo attacks Do not walk along well-worn hippo paths, stay close to your group and don’t approach them from behind, Muruthi said. “Follow the rules. If you are a tourist, and it says ‘Stay in your vehicle,’ then stay in your vehicle. And even when you’re in your vehicle, don’t drive it right to the animal.” Muruthi also advised that your party make some noise in areas known for hippos. “It’s good for them to know you’re around.” “Hippos usually come out of water late in the evening and at night to forage, so avoid trekking along the river at that time,” Muruthi said. Also stay on high alert during the dry season when food is scarce. Get to know the signs of disturbed hippos, Muruthi advised, in case you wander too closely. An agitated one will open its mouth wide and yawn as aggressive display. Also watch for a head thrown back, shaking of the head, grunting and snorting. “These are signs you should have left already!” Muruthi said. If you’ve attracted unwanted attention, Muruthi said to always remember you cannot outrun a hippo. They may look sluggish, but they can run 30 mph (almost 43 kph). Instead, you should try to climb a tree or find an obstacle to put between you and the hippo such as a rock or anthill. Muruthi, Lewison and Templer all said never stay between a hippo and the water. If it’s charging you, run parallel to the water source. As with so many other protective female animals, never get between a mama hippo and her young, Templer said. He was alone, deep in the moutains. And a rattlesnake just bit him. What if you’re in a small watercraft? “Typically, if a hippo is going to be attacking, you’ll see it coming way before. There will be that bow wave. … If you slap the water, the percussion 99.9 times out of 100 will turn the hippo,” Templer said. “If you’re in a canoe and a hippo knocks you in the water, get away from the canoe. The hippo is going for this big shape, getting it off its territory.” It’s also safer to view hippos on the water in a larger vessel, which the animal would have a harder time capsizing, Muruthi said. Unlike attacks by some other wild animals, humans are almost defenseless once an attack by a large hippo begins. “Once attacked, there is nothing you can do,” Muruthi said. “Fight for dear life and watch for any chance to escape.” He said you could try to poke at the eyes or any spot that might inflict unexpected pain. But given the size just of a hippo head, even that’s a tall order. Hippos typically hole punch you, so there isn’t much you can do if they get hold of you. Rebecca Lewison “Hippos typically hole punch you, so there isn’t much you can do if they get hold of you,” Lewison said. Based on his attack, Templer said try not to panic “when dragged underwater. Remember to suck in air if on the surface.” Another hippo attack survivor in this National Geographic video also was able to conserve her breath. She also grabbed the hippo’s snout, and one expert in the video theorizes that might have startled the hippo into letting her go. Two years after that attack, Templer said that he and a team made the longest recorded descent of the Zambezi River to date. It took three months and covered 1,600 miles (2,575 kilometers). How did Templer find the resilience to reclaim his life? After a particularly rough day trying to maneuver in a wheelchair, he said that his surgeon told him: “You’re the sum of your choices. You’re exactly who, what and where you choose to be in life.” Templer said he focused on what’s possible vs. what he’s lost. “If you look for what’s possible, it generally is.” Templer later moved to United States; got married to the sister of a journalist on the record-setting Zambezi trip; wrote the book “What’s Left of Me”; and is a speaker. Should people be afraid to even go on safari – especially in hippo areas – after learning of a harrowing story like Templer’s? Muruthi said go, but go smartly. Be sure to get advice from professional tour guides – and then follow their guidance, Muruthi said. “In Kenya, for example, contact the Kenya Professional Safari Guides Association,” he said. Templer said his attack was an “anomaly,” and he doesn’t want anyone to be dissuaded by what happened on his 1996 river run. “My biggest counsel would be: Absolutely go and do it. But hook yourself up with someone who knows what they’re doing out there. But by all means, go out … and experience it.” © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Get the latest news in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments. He’d spent years backpacking around the world, and Japanese traveler Daisuke Kajiyama was finally ready to return home to pursue his long-held dream of opening up a guesthouse. In 2011, Kajiyama arrived back in Japan with his Israeli partner Hila, who he met in Nepal, and the pair set about finding the perfect location for their future venture. However, there were a couple of major stumbling blocks in their way. To start with, Kajiyama had very little money to speak of after years of globetrotting around destinations like Korea, Taiwan, India, Nepal, Guatemala, Cuba and Canada. He also happened to have his heart set on a traditional Japanese house, typically known as kominka, which are usually passed down over generations. “I wanted to have a traditional house in the countryside,” Kajiyama tells CNN Travel, explaining that he was determined to find two houses located next to each other, so that he and Hila could live in one, while the other would be a guesthouse that they’d run together. “I had a vision.” This US couple bought and renovated a 14th-century Italian home When he was unable to find anything that met his requirements, Kajiyama decided to shift his search to include the growing number of abandoned homes in the country. As younger people ditch rural areas in pursuit of jobs in the city, Japan’s countryside is becoming filled with “ghost” houses, or “akiya.” According to the Japan Policy Forum, there were 61 million houses and 52 million households in Japan in 2013, and with the country’s population expected to decline from 127 million to about 88 million by 2065, this number is likely to increase. Kajiyama was driving around Tamatori, a small village located in the Shizuoka prefecture, between Kyoto and Tokyo, surrounded by green tea plantations and rice fields, when he came across an elderly woman farming, and decided to approach her. “I said ‘Do you know if there are any empty houses around here?’ And she just pointed,” he recalls. He looked over at the area that she was signaling to and spotted two neglected houses side by side – a former green tea factory and an old farmer’s home – located close to a river. Both properties had been uninhabited for at least seven years and needed a huge amount of work. Kajiyama asked the woman to contact the owner to find out if they’d be interested in selling. “The owner said that no one could live there, as it was abandoned,” he says. “But he didn’t say ‘no.’ Everybody was always saying ‘no.’ But he didn’t. So I felt there was a small chance.” Expats buy Japanese country house for a song and get way more than they bargained for Kajiyama returned to visit the houses around five times, before going to visit the owner himself to negotiate an agreement that would see him use the old green tree factory as a home, and convert the farmer’s house into the guesthouse he’d always envisioned. While he was keen to purchase both of the homes, he explains that the traditions around home ownership in Japan mean that he is unable to do so until it’s passed down to the son of the current owner. “They said ‘if you take all the responsibility yourself, you can take it.’ So we made an agreement on paper,” he says. Both he and Hila were aware that they had a lot of work ahead of them, but the couple, who married in 2013, were thrilled to be one step closer to having their own guesthouse in an ideal spot. “It’s a very nice location,” says Kajiyama. “It’s close to the city, but it’s really countryside. Also people still live here and go to work [in the city]. “The house is also in front of the river, so when you go to sleep you can hear the sound of the water.” According to Kajiyama, the process of clearing the house, which is around 90 years old, before beginning the renovation works was one of the hardest parts of the process, simply because there was so much stuff to sort through. However, he was able to repurpose some of the items. During the first year, he spent a lot of time connecting with locals, gaining knowledge about the home, and helping the local farmers with farming for the first year or so. Although he wasn’t hugely experienced with renovation work, he had spent some time farming and completing building while he was backpacking, and had also taken odd jobs fixing peoples homes. He completed much of the work on the guesthouse himself, replacing the floors and adding in a toilet, which he says was a wedding present from his parents, at a cost of around $10,000. “I’m not really a professional,” he says.” I like to do carpentry and I enjoy creating things, but I have no experience in my background. “From my several years of backpacking, I saw so many interesting buildings, so many houses of interesting shapes and I’ve been collecting those in my brain.” Kajiyama was determined to keep the house as authentic as possible by using traditional materials. He saved money by collecting traditional wood from building companies who were in the process of breaking down traditional houses. “They need to spend the money to throw it away,” he explains. “But for me, some of the stuff is like treasure. So I would go and take the material that I wanted. “The house is a very, very old style,” he says. “So it wouldn’t look nice if I brought in more modern materials. It’s totally authentic.” He explains that very little work had previously been done to the house, which is quite unusual for a home built so many years ago. “It’s totally authentic,” he says. “Usually, with traditional houses, some renovations are made to the walls, because the insulation is not so strong. So you lose the style.” He says he received some financial support from the government, which meant he was able to bring in a carpenter and also benefited from Japan’s working holiday program, which allows travelers to work in exchange for food and board, when he needed extra help. After doing some research into Japanese guesthouse permits, he discovered that one of the simplest ways to acquire one would be to register the property as an agriculture guesthouse. As the area is filled with bamboo forests, this seemed like a no-brainer, and Kajiyama decided to learn everything he could about bamboo farming so that he could combine the two businesses. “This is how I started farming,” he says. In 2014, two years after they began working on the house, the couple were finally able to welcome their first guests. “It was a beautiful feeling,” says Kajiyama. “Of course, this was my dream. But people really appreciate that it was abandoned and I brought it back to life.” He says that hosting guests from all over the world has helped him to stay connected to his former life as a backpacker. “I stay in one place, but people come to me and I feel like I’m traveling,” he says. “Today, it’s Australia, tomorrow it’s the UK and next week South Africa and India. “People come from different places and they invite me to join them for dinner, so sometimes I join someone’s family life.” Sadly, Hila passed away from cancer in 2022. Kajiyama stresses that his beloved wife played a huge part in helping him achieve his dream of having a guesthouse and says he couldn’t have done it without her. “We were really together,” he adds. “She created this place with me. Without her it would not have been like this.” While the three-bedroom guesthouse, which measures around 80 square meters, has been open for around eight years, Kajiyama is still working on it, and says he has no idea when he’ll be finished. “It’s never ending,” he admits. “I’m halfway, I feel. It is beautiful already. But it started off abandoned, so it needs more details. And I’m getting better at creating, so I need time to do it.” He explains that he’s unable to complete work on the home while guests are there. And while the property is closed during the winter, he spends two months as a bamboo farmer and usually spends a month traveling, which doesn’t leave him much time for renovations. “Sometimes I don’t do anything,” he admits. Yui Valley, which offers activities such as bamboo weaving workshops, has helped to bring many travelers to the village of Tamatori over the years. “Most of the guests come after Tokyo, and it’s such a contrast,” he says. “They are really happy to share the nature and the tradition in our house. “Most people have dreamed of coming to Japan for a long time and they have a very short time here. “So they have such a beautiful energy. I’m happy to host in this way and join their holiday time. It’s very special [for me].” Kajiyama estimates that he’s spent around $40,000 on the renovation work so far, and if the feedback from guests, and locals, is anything to go by, it seems to have been money well spent. “People appreciate what I’ve done,” he adds. “So that makes me feel special.” As for Hiroko, the woman who pointed out the house to him over a decade ago, Kajiyama says she’s stunned at the transformation, and is amazed at how many international travelers are coming to Tamatori to stay at Yui Valley. “She cannot believe how much more beautiful it is [now],” he says. “She didn’t think it was going to be like this. So she really appreciates it. She says ‘thank you’ a lot.” Yui Valley, 1170 Okabecho Tamatori, Fujieda, Shizuoka 421-1101, Japan © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Due to its remoteness and short summer season, Mongolia has long been a destination overlooked by travelers. But as the country moves to further open up to tourism by easing its entry conditions for international visitors and upgrading its infrastructure, 2023 might just be the best time yet to get there. Here are 10 reasons travelers should start planning their long-dreamed-of Mongolia visit now. With the government of Mongolia declaring 2023 through 2025 the “Years to Visit Mongolia,” citizens from an additional 34 countries can now visit the country visa-free through the end of 2025. The addition of several European countries, including Denmark, France, Greece, Italy, Norway, Spain, and the UK, as well as Australia and New Zealand, now brings the total number of countries and territories on the visa-exempt list to 61. The full list is here. After years of delays, a pandemic and several controversies, the newly built Chinggis Khaan International Airport finally opened in the summer of 2021. With the ability to handle approximately 3 million passengers a year (double that of the old airport), the addition of 500 new aircraft parking spaces and the infrastructure to support an increase in domestic as well as budget flights, the airport is a welcome addition to the country’s efforts to grow tourism. Budget flights to Hong Kong from EZNIS Airways have been relaunched since the airport’s opening, and talks to resume direct flights to the United States are reportedly underway. The recently opened Chinggis Khaan Museum offers a beautiful, fresh look at Mongolia’s tumultuous history. With more than 10,000 artifacts spanning over 2,000 years, the museum explores the history of the Mongols and the empire they created – and eventually lost. The museum’s artifacts are presented over eight floors, with six permanent and two temporary exhibition halls. Guided tours are offered in English every Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. free of charge. When most people think of Mongolia, music festivals and conservation-focused art installations in the heart of one of the world’s largest deserts are the last things to come to mind. But that’s all changing thanks to festivals like Playtime, Spirit of Gobi, INTRO Electronic Music Festival and the Kharkhorum 360 Visual Art & Music Experience. Placing international bands, DJs, and musicians from around the world alongside Mongolia’s eclectic mix of rappers, bands and folk singers, the country just might be one of the world’s most underrated places for festival lovers. The annual Naadam event has always been a great reason to visit Mongolia, but now that the festival has just celebrated its 100 year anniversary, 2023 is as good a time as ever to attend. While the festival’s origins are rooted in the days of Genghis Khan, when he used horse racing, wrestling and archery competitions to keep his warriors in shape between battles, Naadam only officially became a national holiday 100 years ago. Today, the festival – held in Ulaanbaatar at the National Sports Stadium, has a few more bells and whistles than it did during the days of the Great Khan. A seat at July 11’s opening ceremony is always one of the hardest tickets to score in town. Mounted archery is seeing a resurgence in Mongolia thanks to guys like Altankhuyag Nergui, one of the most accomplished archers in the sport and his archery academy, Namnaa. Here, locals learn the fundamentals of Mongolian archery before mounting a horse and taking their new found skills to another level. In the summer months, students and academy members put on weekly shows for interested spectators. The academy also offers day-long training sessions for those wanting to try this intense sport. Speaking of giving life to Mongolia’s most ancient traditions, the resurrection of Mongol bichig, or the traditional Mongolian script written from top to bottom and read from left to right, has also seen a major resurgence in recent years. Visit the Erdenesiin Khuree Mongolian Calligraphy Center in Karakorum to learn from master calligraphist Tamir Samandbadraa Purev about this important cultural heritage. And, while you’re there, browse the yurts filled with Tamir’s works. Pair the release of Husqvarna’s new Norden 901 Expedition motorbike with Nomadic Off-Road’s newly announced Eagle Hunter Tour, and you have one of the fastest adventures in Mongolia. The tour takes six riders 1,700 kilometers from Ulaanbaatar to Bayan-Ulgii, where riders eventually meet their hosts, Mongolia’s famous eagle hunters. The only thing faster than this adventure is the rate at which Nomadic Off-Road’s tours sell out. Capturing the art of the last eagle hunters of Mongolia Professional musher Joel Rauzy has been leading dogsledding tours across the frozen Lake Khuvsgul for 18 years. With fewer crowds, lower hotel rates and the chance to see one of the largest freshwater lakes in the world completely frozen over, winter in Mongolia is something else to see and experience. Rauzy’s company, Wind of Mongolia, offers tours of the lake, where each person is assigned their own sled and dogs for the journey. Following Rauzy’s lead, mushers will make a loop of the lake. Activities include ice fishing, while travelers stay in winterized yurts and spend time with nomadic families along the journey. Nestled in the heart of Selenge province on the Yeruu River, Yeruu Lodge is the brainchild of Norwegian founder Eirik Gulsrud Johnsen, who first visited Mongolia in 2017. With a minimal Scandinavian-style restaurant and dining area, a handful of fully kitted out yurts for guests to stay in, two pétanque courts, kayaks, a driving range, mountain bikes and a yoga area, the lodge is a destination for nature lovers. Completely off-grid, the lodge runs off solar panels, uses of thermal heating, and all of the property’s water comes from an on-property well and is recycled after use. Additionally, all glass, metal and plastic used at the lodge is also recycled, and food waste is turned into compost used to grow vegetables, berries and herbs onsite. The lodge is set to open in April 2023. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved. CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."
1,2024-08-06 07:36:50.000,CNN.com - RSS Channel - World,2024-08-06 05:27:12.000,The most beautiful sections of China's Great Wall,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/china-beautiful-great-wall-sections-cmd/index.html,2023-09-18 02:57:08.000,"Editor’s Note: Monthly Ticket is a CNN Travel series that spotlights some of the most fascinating topics in the travel world. In September, we’re celebrating superlatives as we look at some of the world’s biggest, tallest and most expensive attractions and destinations. Having lived in Beijing for almost 12 years, I’ve had plenty of time to travel widely in China. I’ve visited more than 100 cities, not to mention countless towns and villages throughout the mainland’s 31 provinces. Looking back, I’ve come to realize it was my frequent visits to different parts of the Great Wall in Beijing that were a driving force behind my desire to explore the rest of the country and, along with it, the many sections of wall that lie outside the capital’s boundaries. Work on the Great Wall began more than 2,500 years ago, its origins dating back to China’s Spring and Autumn Period of around 770 BCE to 476 BCE. Various sections were added in subsequent eras as competing dynasties and factions sought to exert their control. Work eventually stopped in the 17th century. What's it like to walk the entire length of China's Great Wall? Though not a single, unbroken structure, the wall spans over 21,000 kilometers, winding through 15 provinces, 97 prefectures and 404 counties. And while certain sections have been incredibly popular among tourists, many parts have slipped into obscurity, disrepair and sometimes oblivion. Whether you’re planning to visit the Great Wall for the first time or the 50th, the following destinations are sure to make your trip to China even more worthwhile. (Check out the above video for dramatic aerial footage of some of these amazing sites.) The Great Wall is not simply a brick and mortar bulwark; in certain places, towers on jagged mountain peaks, fortress towns or even wide rivers count as sections of “wall.” The Turtle City, built in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) as part of the Great Wall’s “Yellow River Defense Line,” was completed in 1608 and was home to around 2,000 infantrymen and 500 cavalry units during peak use. Today, this fortress city is located in the Sitan Township of Jingtai County in north central Gansu province. While there aren’t many real turtles in the “Turtle City,” the garrison town got its nickname due to its unique shape. The south gate acts as the head and the west and east gates as the flippers. The town’s oval wall is the body, while the north gate acts as its tail. As one of the most well-preserved and truly authentic walled cities left in China today, it’s definitely worth your time. Staying in the Jingtai County center is recommended. The ancient city is only a 30-minute cab ride from your lodgings, so you can visit whenever the light is best for photos. When in Jingtai, try local specialties such as the five Buddha tofu and the Jingtai cold mixed noodles – both are spicy vegetarian dishes. A walk through the sprawling night market in Jingtai County People’s Square, which boasts more than 50 snack stalls, is also recommended for adventurous foodies. Regional Chinese food: 8 lesser-known cuisines worth trying Getting there: Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu province, has a major international airport and high-speed train connections from many cities in China. The drive to Yongtai Turtle City from downtown Lanzhou takes about 2.5 hours (195 kilometers). From Lanzhou Zhongchuan Airport, it’s only 1.5 hours (125 kilometers). Mutianyu and Jiankou are two parts of the same Stone Dragon – two contiguous sections of the Great Wall that together stretch for roughly 25 kilometers along Beijing’s mountaintops. Historical records show that millions of men spent centuries constructing the Great Wall. Stand atop the wall at either Mutianyu or Jiankou, and you’ll begin to comprehend the gravity of this statement. These two sections are arguably the two most classic examples of Ming Dynasty Great Wall surviving today, and climbing either is guaranteed to be a life-changing experience. Mutianyu is the best portion of the “tourist wall.” Restored in the 1980s, it’s very commercial but also superbly beautiful. Visitors not up for the hike can take a cable car to the top. Off-the-radar destinations every visitor to China should consider To the west of Mutianyu, Jiankou is colloquially known as the “wild wall” – no ticket needed and not commercialized. That being said, as of 2020, hiking at Jiankou has become somewhat frowned upon by the local government because of safety concerns. Mutianyu and Jiankou are less than a 90-minute drive (without traffic) from downtown Beijing, yet it’s highly recommended to enjoy a night in the countryside if time allows. Jiankou can be accessed via Xizhazi village; if dates align, you might even be able to spend a few days with William Lindesay, world-renowned Great Wall historian, and his wonderful family at The Barracks, their wall-side courtyard home. For lodgings around Mutianyu, The Brickyard is a superbly comfortable choice. In fall and spring, shades of the wall’s gray brick contrast with nature’s vibrant colors. Peak autumn foliage and spring cherry blossoms provide stunning backdrops for photos. For winter sports enthusiasts, there’s skiing and skating next to the Wall at locations not far from Mutianyu. Getting to Mutianyu: Restrictions on applying for temporary driving licenses in China were relaxed in September 2019, so renting a car as a foreign tourist is entirely possible. (International driving licenses are not accepted in China.) You can also hire a car with a driver for the day or take the Mutianyu Special Tourism Bus from the Dongzhimen Wai Bus Station. Getting to Jiankou: Renting a car or booking private transport is recommended. As Xizhazi is a small village, buses are scarce so it can take up to five hours to get there by public transport, as opposed to 90 minutes by car. Bataizi village sits just inside the Motianling section of the Great Wall and is home to the ruins of a Gothic church built in 1876 under the direction of a German missionary. The church has been damaged and repaired numerous times in its nearly 150-year history; the bell tower is the only part still standing. The juxtaposition of its ruins against the rammed-earth Great Wall makes Bataizi a unique place to spend a morning or afternoon. China's best new outdoor attractions After finishing your hike along the wall and visiting the church ruins, drop in to the village’s “new” church to say hello to Father Pan; if you speak Chinese, he can answer any questions about the village’s long connection with Catholicism. Besides Bataizi, Datong should also be on your tourist map; visiting the Yungang Grottoes (a UNESCO world heritage site) and the Hengshan Hanging Temple will make your trip even more memorable. Late summer is an ideal time to visit Bataizi, as you’ll see a wonderful contrast between the Great Wall and the lush green hills. Getting there: Bataizi village is 80 kilometers west of Datong, one of Shanxi province’s largest and most famous cities. Zuoyun County is only 22 kilometers away from Bataizi – about a 35-minute drive. Datong is easily accessible by plane or high-speed train from other cities in China; a taxi from downtown Datong to Bataizi should cost roughly 300 yuan (about $43). Alternatively, you can make your way to Zuoyun County by bus then hop in a taxi. In Datong, luxury seekers will want to head for the five-star Yunzhong Traditional Courtyard Hotel. Zuoyun County has one hotel that can accept foreigners: Zuoyun Jinshan International Hotel. Both can be found on popular hotel booking sites. As the locals say, Laoniuwan is where the Great Wall and the mighty Yellow River shake hands. The Laoniuwan Fortress was built in 1467, while the most famous tower of the Great Wall in this area, Wanghe Tower (literally meaning river-watching tower), was constructed in 1544. Laoniuwan village is located in Pianguan County, part of Xinzhou city in Shanxi province, just across the river from Inner Mongolia. Late summer or early fall is a great time to visit, as you’ll avoid the potentially dangerous mountain roads during spring rainstorms, or being uncomfortably cold in a place without great infrastructure. Along the Great Wall, there are only a few places where it meets bodies of water; of all those, this is the most stunning. A boat ride along the river is highly recommended. You’ll be able to soak in the natural beauty of the Yellow River Gorge while marveling at the steadfast resolve of these ancient architects. Swell life: China's surf scene is heating up Getting there: Laoniuwan is difficult to get to by public transportation. The best option is to rent or book a car to take you from Datong to Laoniuwan via Bataizi – this way, you’ll be able to see two incredible locations along the Great Wall in one trip. Pianguan is the nearest city, about one hour away. Pianguan does not have a train station or an airport. The only option is to arrive by bus. Shuozhou, 140 kilometers from Laoniuwan, has an airport opening later this year. Construction on the Great Wall in Simatai began in 1373. It was expanded and reinforced periodically throughout the Ming Dynasty. The Fairy Tower is one of the best-known towers of the wall at Simatai but also one of the least visited due to how difficult it is to access. Instead, aim to take in incredible views of the Fairy Tower from Wangjing Tower (just a few hundred meters away). It’s a journey that will satiate even the most adventurous hikers, yet can be done without any ropes, ladders or other essential safety gear. As with a visit to Mutianyu/Jiankou, this section of wall is guaranteed to deliver stunning views any time of year. My only suggestion is to wait for a clear day (usually visibility is great the day after it rains or snows), as the view from Wangjing Tower is unobstructed in every direction. The hike to the Fairy Tower will leave you in awe of the Northern Barbarians’ supposed determination to reach the capital; the mountains are nearly impassable on foot, let alone by horse, with sheer cliff faces on either side. It makes for absolutely world-class hiking and an interesting history lesson. Five-star lodgings are available at Hobo Farm; they also have an incredible restaurant that serves delicious Western and Chinese fare. For 4.5 star lodgings with a lower price tag, try Yatou’s Homestay. Both can be found on major hotel booking sites. Getting there: Both the Fairy Tower and Wangjing Tower should be accessed via Tangjiazhai village, located in Beijing’s Miyun district. Tangjiazhai village is 140 kilometers from downtown Beijing, depending on your route. Booking a private car from the city is probably the most time-effective way to get there. You can also take a high-speed train from Beijing Station to Miyun district and switch to a bus or taxi from there. Constructed during the reign of Emperor Jiajing (1507-1567), this single-wall section stands seven meters tall in some spots – no small feat considering it was made by piling stones. It’s located just across the road from the town of Dushikou, in Chicheng in Hebei province. The piled-stone wall at Dushikou is unique, as many other sections of the Great Wall close to Beijing were constructed using kiln-fired bricks. Dushikou is best visited in the summer, specifically July and August, when the rolling hills of the surrounding grasslands are peak green. Cool evenings make for perfect outdoor barbecue/bonfire weather. You’ll be able to find clean and comfortable farmhouse lodgings in Dushikou town; alternatively, Chicheng, 45 minutes away, has a range of hotels to choose from. Lamb skewers and roast leg of lamb are specialties in these parts, as this part of Hebei is very close to the border with Inner Mongolia. Noodle lovers should also try the local oat noodles, which are delicious. Getting there: Thanks to all the infrastructure built for the 2022 Winter Olympics, the drive to Dushikou has been shortened by almost two hours. If you prefer not to drive, hop on a bus to Chicheng from the Liuliqiao Transport Hub in Beijing and take a 45-minute taxi ride to Dushikou. Note that public transportation will take one or two hours longer than private car. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

Related gallery Inside 2022's 'CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute' Online voters selected her from among this year’s Top 10 CNN Heroes. Cheboi’s nonprofit, TechLit Africa, has provided thousands of students across rural Kenya with access to donated, upcycled computers — and the chance at a brighter future. Cheboi accepted the award with her mother, who she said “worked really hard to educate us.” At the beginning of her acceptance speech, Cheboi and her mother sang a song onstage that she explained had a special meaning when she was growing up. As CNN Hero of the Year, Cheboi will receive $100,000 to expand her work. She and the other top 10 CNN Heroes honored at Sunday’s gala all receive a $10,000 cash award and, for the first time, additional grants, organizational training and support from The Elevate Prize Foundation through a new collaboration with CNN Heroes. Nelly will also be named an Elevate Prize winner, which comes with a $300,000 grant and additional support worth $200,000 for her nonprofit. Cheboi grew up in poverty in Mogotio, a rural township in Kenya. “I know the pain of poverty,” said Cheboi, 29. “I never forgot what it was like with my stomach churning because of hunger at night.” A hard-working student, Cheboi received a full scholarship to Augustana College in Illinois in 2012. She began her studies there with almost no experience with computers, handwriting papers and struggling to transcribe them onto a laptop. Related article This CNN Hero upcycles old computers to open new worlds for young Kenyans Everything changed in her junior year, though, when Cheboi took a programming course required for her mathematics major. “When I discovered computer science, I just fell in love with it. I knew that this is something that I wanted to do as my career, and also bring it to my community,” she told CNN. Many basic computer skills were still a steep learning curve, however. Cheboi remembers having to practice touch-typing for six months before she could pass a coding interview. Touch-typing is a skill that is now a core part of the TechLit curriculum. “I feel so accomplished seeing kids that are 7 years old touch-typing, knowing that I just learned how to touch-type less than five years ago,” she said. Once she had begun working in the software industry, Cheboi soon realized the extent of which computers were being thrown away as companies upgraded their technology infrastructure. Related video Watch Sofia Carson perform 'Applause' at CNN Heroes celebration “We have kids here (in Kenya) — myself included, back in the day — who don’t even know what a computer is,” she said. So, in 2018, she began transporting donated computers back to Kenya — in her personal luggage, handling customs fees and taxes herself. “At one point, I was bringing 44 computers, and I paid more for the luggage than I did for the air ticket,” she said. A year later, she co-founded TechLit Africa with a fellow software engineer after both quit their jobs. The nonprofit accepts computer donations from companies, universities and individuals. The hardware is wiped and refurbished before it’s shipped to Kenya. There, it’s distributed to partner schools in rural communities, where students ages 4 to 12 receive daily classes and frequent opportunities to learn from professionals, gaining skills that will help improve their education and better prepare them for future jobs. “We have people who own a specific skill coming in and are just inspiring the kids (with) music production, video production, coding, personal branding,” Cheboi said. “They can go from doing a remote class with NASA on education to music production.” The organization currently serves 10 schools; within the next year, Cheboi hopes to be partnered with 100 more. “My hope is that when the first TechLit kids graduate high school, they’re able to get a job online because they will know how to code, they will know how to do graphic design, they will know how to do marketing,” Cheboi said. “The world is your oyster when you are educated. By bringing the resources, by bringing these skills, we are opening up the world to them.” CNN’s Anderson Cooper and ABC’s Kelly Ripa co-hosted the 16th Annual “CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute,” which featured more than a dozen celebrity presenters. “We’re so deeply honored to be here,” said actress and singer Sofia Carson, who perfomed a song with award-winning songwriter Diane Warren at the event. “Diane wrote this incredible anthem ‘Applause’ for those leading, surviving and fighting and tonight we dedicate this song and performance to our heroes.” Actor Aubrey Plaza introduced CNN Hero Aidan Reilly, who launched his nonprofit while home from college during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic. “From his pandemic couch, Aidan and his friends co-founded Farmlink Project,” Plaza said. The nonprofit connects excess food from farms across the US – food that would otherwise be wasted – to those who need it. “In just two years, he .. has moved more than 70 million pounds,” Plaza added.

And Emmy award-winning actor Justin Theroux brought his rescue dog Kuma, on the stage to honor Carie Broecker ​​and her nonprofit, Peace of Mind Dog Rescue. Two teenagers making a difference in their communities were also honored as 2022 Young Wonders: Ruby Chitsey, a 15-year-old from Harrison, Arkansas, started “Three Wishes for Ruby’s Residents,” which donates personal items to nursing home residents who couldn’t otherwise afford them. Sri Nihal Tammana, a 13-year-old from Edison, New Jersey, started “Recycle My Battery,” which keeps used batteries out of the ecosystem through a network of collection bins. The show also honored two Georgia poll workers, Shaye Moss and her mother Ruby Freeman, whose lives were upended after false allegations that they had been involved in election fraud spread on social media. CNN has partnered with GoFundMe to enable donations to this year’s Top 10 honorees. GoFundMe is the world’s largest fundraising platform that empowers people and charities to give and receive help. Supporters can make online donations to the Top 10 CNN Heroes’ non-profit organizations directly from CNNHeroes.com.

If you need a 0% intro APR for as long as possible, then the Wells Fargo Reflect® Card is worth getting. It gives you plenty of time to pay off purchases and balance transfers without incurring interest charges. Those who can make do with a shorter intro APR period should look for cards with more benefits, such as cash rewards and a welcome offer. The nice thing about credit cards with a 0% intro APR is that it's easy to compare them. The key factor is how long the intro rate lasts -- on purchases, balance transfers, or both, depending on what you need the card for. For example, if you have a lot of debt and are looking for a way to refinance it, then you'd probably want to go with the card that has the longest 0% intro APR on balance transfers. Wells Fargo has done a great job in this regard. Not only does this card have a lengthy introductory period, it applies to purchases and balance transfers. Want to know what other sites and real cardholders think of the Wells Fargo Reflect® Card? Here's what we found. Average competitor rating: 4.1 / 5 stars After reading reviews from five other top sites, there's a pretty clear consensus about this Wells Fargo card. We all agree that the 0% intro APR offer is excellent, making it one of the best credit cards for avoiding interest, and that the cellphone protection is a valuable extra. Everyone's in agreement about this card's drawbacks, too: Lack of rewards, a high balance transfer fee, and a foreign transaction fee. The only difference of opinion is the overall rating each of us gave this card. The Wells Fargo Reflect® Card hasn't exactly set the social media world on fire, but responses have generally been positive. It's widely recognized as an excellent 0% intro APR and balance transfer card. Some cardholders have called out the balance transfer fee of 5%, min: $5, since that's more than the 3% charged by several other cards. But they also acknowledge that 21 months from account opening is a long time to pay off credit card debt. If you need to avoid interest charges for as long as possible, look no further. The Wells Fargo Reflect® Card has a 0% intro APR on purchases and qualifying balance transfers for 21 months from account opening. That's nearly two years where you won't be paying credit card interest. Balance transfers made within the first 120 days qualify for the intro rate. After the intro period ends, the go-to 18.24%, 24.74%, or 29.99% Variable APR applies on your card's balance going forward. This is the longest 0% intro APR I've seen. Since it applies to purchases and balance transfers, there are all kinds of ways to use it. You could: Considering how much smartphones cost, and the many hazards they seem to face, it's a good idea to have yours insured. They may seem affordable when you're paying them off across 24 monthly payments. When you lose one and need to pay MSRP for a new iPhone, that's when you realize it costs about as much as a rent payment. If you have this card and use it to pay your monthly cellphone bill, you won't need to shell out extra for insurance. It has complimentary cellphone protection of up to $600, with a $25 deductible. This covers damage, theft, and involuntary or accidental parting (when you know where your phone is, but it's impractical to recover it). The biggest drawback with this card is that it doesn't offer any sort of rewards program. That means: To be fair, this card has special offers through My Wells Fargo Deals, where you can earn cash back statement credits on shopping, dining, and experiences you pay for with your eligible Wells Fargo card. But earning some statement credits here and there isn't nearly as valuable as earning cash rewards on all your everyday purchases. Because of the lack of rewards, this card doesn't have much long-term value. Once the 0% intro APR ends, there's no incentive to continue using it. You're better off switching to a rewards credit card at that point. It's worth noting that there are 0% APR credit cards that also have rewards programs. They just have shorter 0% APR intro periods. If you don't need the entire 21 months from account opening this Wells Fargo card offers, then it could make more sense to pick a card with a shorter intro period that earns rewards. The Wells Fargo Reflect® Card is a great balance transfer card because of its 0% intro APR. But it also has a balance transfer fee of 5%, min: $5. Balance transfer cards normally have a fee like this, but some of them only charge 3%. It may not seem like much, but if you're transferring $5,000, that 2% difference would cost you an extra $100. If you don't need 21 months from account opening to get out of debt, you may want to look at more credit card reviews and pick a card with a lower balance transfer fee. There's also a foreign transaction fee of 3%, which is another reason why this isn't the best card for long-term use. If you ever travel outside the United States, it's important to have a card you can use without any extra fees, like a travel credit card A FICO® Score of 670 or higher, which is considered good credit, is suggested to apply for the Wells Fargo Reflect® Card. Keep in mind that credit card applications depend on many factors, including your income and other parts of your financial profile. Wells Fargo offers an online prequalification tool. All you need to do is provide some basic information, and you'll see any prequalified credit card offers you have with Wells Fargo, which may or may not include the Wells Fargo Reflect® Card. The Wells Fargo Reflect® Card has a 0% intro APR for 21 months from account opening on purchases and qualifying balance transfers. Balance transfers made within 120 days from account opening qualify for the introductory rate. Here are the fees for the Wells Fargo Reflect® Card: The minimum credit limit on the Wells Fargo Reflect® Card is $1,000. It's possible to get a much larger amount -- some cardholders have reported being approved for limits of over $25,000. When you're approved for this card, Wells Fargo sets a credit limit based on several factors, primarily your income and credit history. If you want to earn cash rewards: The Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card earns an unlimited 2% cash rewards on purchases and has a $200 cash rewards welcome bonus for spending $500 in the first three months. This card's intro APR doesn't last as long, but if you don't need as long as 21 months, then its cash rewards could make it a better choice. If you want a lower balance transfer fee: The Citi Double Cash® Card has a balance transfer fee of 3% ($5 min.) on transfers in the first four months, 5% ($5 min.) thereafter. Those transfers also qualify for a 0% intro APR for 18 months. If you can pay off your debt within a year and a half, this card is a good choice, because you'll save money on fees. At The Motley Fool Ascent, we rate credit cards on a five-star scale (1 = poor, 5 = best). Our rating criteria includes rewards rates, welcome bonuses, fees, and perks like travel credits and 0% intro APR offers to evaluate our ratings. We combine these factors with an evaluation of brand reputation and customer satisfaction to ensure you're getting the best card recommendations. Learn more about how The Ascent rates credit cards. It's not hard to get approved for the Wells Fargo Reflect® Card, but it depends on your credit score and your financial profile.

The credit limit for the Wells Fargo Reflect® Card can range from $1,000 to over $10,000. Wells Fargo sets your credit limit when it approves you for the card based on your creditworthiness, income, and other financial information.

2,2024-08-06 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-06 05:36:42.000,"Google's online search monopoly is illegal, US judge rules",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0k44x6mge3o,2024-08-05 22:30:03.000,"A US judge has ruled Google acted illegally to crush its competition and maintain a monopoly on online search and related advertising. The landmark decision on Monday is a major blow to Alphabet, Google's parent company, and could reshape how technology giants do business. Google was sued by the US Department of Justice in 2020 over its control of about 90% of the online search market. It is one of several lawsuits that have been filed against the big tech companies as US antitrust authorities attempt to strengthen competition in the industry. This case has at times been described as posing an existential threat to Google and its owner given its dominance of the search and online advertising business. It is unclear yet what penalties Google and Alphabet will face as a result of the decision. The fines or other remedies will be decided in a future hearing. The government has asked for ""structural relief"" - which could, in theory at least, mean the break-up of the company. In his decision, US District Judge Amit Mehta said Google had paid billions to ensure it is the default search engine on smartphones and browsers. “Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,” Judge Mehta wrote in his 277-page opinion. Alphabet said it plans to appeal against the ruling. “This decision recognises that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn’t be allowed to make it easily available,"" the statement from the company said. US Attorney General Merrick Garland, the country's top prosecutor, hailed the ruling as a ""historic win for the American people"". “No company - no matter how large or influential - is above the law,"" Mr Garland said in a statement on Monday. ""The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.” Federal antitrust regulators have filed other pending lawsuits against Big Tech companies - including Meta Platforms, which owns Facebook, Amazon.com and Apple Inc - accusing them of operating unlawful monopolies. Monday's ruling comes after a 10-week trial in Washington DC, in which prosecutors accused Google of spending billions of dollars annually to Apple, Samsung, Mozilla and others to be pre-installed as the default search engine across platforms. The US said Google typically pays more than $10bn (£7.8bn) a year for that privilege, securing its access to a steady stream of user data that helped maintain its hold on the market. Doing so, prosecutors said, meant other companies have not had the opportunity or resources to meaningfully compete. ""The best testimony for that, for the importance of defaults, is Google's cheque book,"" argued Department of Justice lawyer Kenneth Dintzer during the trial. Google's search engine is a big revenue generator for the company, bringing in billions of dollars thanks in large part to advertising displayed on its results pages. Google's lawyers defended the company by saying that users are attracted to their search engine because they find it useful, and that Google is investing to make it better for consumers. “Google is winning because it’s better,” said Google's lawyer John Schmidtlein during closing arguments earlier this year. Mr Schmidtlein also argued during the trial that Google still faces intense competition, not just from general search engine firms, such as Microsoft's Bing, but more specialised sites and apps that people use to find restaurants, airline flights and more. In his ruling, Judge Mehta concluded that being the default search engine is ""extremely valuable real estate"" for Google. ""Even if a new entrant were positioned from a quality standpoint to bid for the default when an agreement expires, such a firm could compete only if it were prepared to pay partners upwards of billions of dollars in revenue share,"" Judge Mehta wrote. Another case against the technology company over its advertising technology is scheduled to go to trial in September. In Europe, meanwhile, Google has been fined billions in monopoly cases.

Mr Biden said he had been briefed on preparations to support Israel should it be attacked, while Secretary of State Antony Blinken said officials were working ""around the clock"" to prevent an escalation. Tensions have risen over the last week following the assassination of Hamas' political leader Ismail Haniyeh, for which Iran has blamed Israel and vowed “severe” retaliation. Israel has not claimed responsibility for the assassination. Numerous countries, including the US and UK, have also told their citizens to leave Lebanon, from where it is feared Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militia and political movement, could play a role in any response.  During Monday's briefing, Mr Biden was told the timing and nature of an Iranian attack remained unclear, according to US news site Axios. A day earlier, Mr Blinken reportedly told his G7 counterparts that Iran and Hezbollah could attack Israel within 24 to 48 hours. In a statement released after the briefing, Mr Biden said: ""We received updates on threats posed by Iran and its proxies, diplomatic efforts to de-escalate regional tensions, and preparations to support Israel should it be attacked again."" He added that steps were being taken to respond to attacks on US forces ""in a manner and place of our choosing"". On Monday, several US personnel were injured in a suspected rocket attack on a US military base in Iraq. Speaking to reporters earlier in the day, Mr Blinken said officials were ""engaged in intense diplomacy pretty much around the clock with a very simple message: All parties must refrain from escalation"". ""Escalation is not in anyone's interests. It will only lead to more conflict, more violence, more insecurity,"" he said. He added that a ceasefire would ""unlock possibilities for more enduring calm not only in Gaza itself, but in other areas where the conflict can spread"". ""It is urgent that all parties make the right choices in the hours and days ahead,"" he said. Earlier in the day, Mr Biden spoke to King Abdullah II of Jordan about ""efforts to de-escalate regional tensions, including through an immediate ceasefire and hostage release deal"", a statement from the White House said. A joint statement from the G7 also expressed ""deep concern at the heightened level of tension in the Middle East which threatens to ignite a broader conflict in the region"". ""No country or nation stands to gain from a further escalation in the Middle East,"" it said. Talks that had brought renewed hope of a ceasefire deal to end the conflict in Gaza have faltered following the events of recent weeks. On 27 July, 12 children and teenagers were killed in a strike on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Israel accused Hezbollah of carrying out the strike, though Hezbollah denied any involvement. Days later, Fuad Shukr, a senior Hezbollah military commander, was killed in an Israeli airstrike on a suburb of the Lebanese capital, Beirut. Four others, including two children, were also killed. Hours later, Haniyeh was assassinated in Iran. Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said Haniyeh was killed in a ""strong blast"" caused by a ""short-range projectile"" fired from outside a house where he was staying while visiting the capital, Tehran. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said in an interview with Russian state news agency RIA Novosti that the killing would have a ""negative impact on the ongoing negotiations"". Israel has not commented on the assassination, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said afterwards that Israel had delivered “crushing blows” to Iran’s proxy groups in recent days. Following the killings in Lebanon and Iran, the IRGC said Israel would receive a ""severe punishment at the appropriate time, place and manner"", while Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said the conflict had entered a ""new phase"". It is the closest the conflict has come to escalation since April, when Iran fired some 300 drones and missiles at Israel in response to an Israeli strike on an Iranian consulate in Syria that killed a number of senior military commanders. On Monday, Jordan asked all airlines planning to land at its airports to carry an additional 45 minutes' worth of fuel, a move thought to be a precaution in case Jordan has to close its airspace in the event of a regional conflict. German flag carrier Lufthansa has suspended all flights to Tel Aviv, Tehran, and Beirut until and including 12 August. US airline Delta has also paused flights to Tel Aviv until at least 31 August ""due to ongoing conflict in the region"". The UK Foreign Office currently advises against all travel to Lebanon and has urged British citizens in the country to leave. It also advises against all travel to the northern area of Israel that shares a border with Lebanon. The conflict in Gaza began following the 7 October attack on Israel by Hamas and other militant groups, which saw around 1,200 people killed and another 251 taken back to Gaza as hostages. Since the launch of Israel's retaliatory ground invasion in Gaza, more than 39,600 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Hezbollah and Israeli forces have also exchanged near-daily attacks since the conflict began, with hundreds of people killed and thousands displaced on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border. Hezbollah and Hamas are both backed by Iran and form part of what Iran calls the ""axis of resistance"", a loose alliance of militant and political groups across the region that oppose Israel and its key ally, the US. The storm is now expected to bring heavy flooding to parts of Georgia and the Carolinas in the coming days. The attack comes as the US warns the Middle East is at a critical moment after the killings of Hamas and Hezbollah senior leaders. Ms Vance says it was a ""quip"" and she wants people to understand her husband's larger argument. Bizarre headlines, a new opponent and limited cash have left the independent candidate struggling. The Republican megadonor who's said to have funded the trip says it is a politically motivated attack by Democrats. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

The Nikkei 225 stock index rose by as much as 10% after slumping by over 12% the previous day. Monday's market rout in Tokyo came after the Bank of Japan's second rate hike in 17 years sent the yen soaring against the dollar making Japanese stocks - and the country's exports - more expensive for foreign investors and buyers. Stocks in the US, the UK and Europe also fell on Monday due to fears that the American economy is heading for a slowdown. Jesper Koll, executive director of Monex Group Japan, said he still had confidence in the country's stocks despite Monday's big falls. ""Japan’s fundamentals are strong, recession risks are nil, and corporate leaders are dead-set on raising capital returns,"" he told the BBC. Shares in South Korea were also regaining ground on Tuesday. The Kospi stock index was up more than 4% after falling 8.8% on Tuesday - its worst trading session since the global financial crisis of 2008. Taiwan's main stock index was trading more than 3% higher, after a record 8.4% drop on Monday. Weak jobs data in the US on Friday sparked concerns about growth in the world's largest economy. It also stoked speculation about when, and by how much, the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. “Markets are very volatile at the moment and will likely stay volatile until the Fed decision in September. So we wouldn't rule out rapid swings in both directions,” said Stefan Angrick, a senior economist with Moody's Analytics. There are also concerns that shares in big technology companies, particularly those investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), have been overvalued and are now facing difficulties. Last week, chipmaker Intel announced major layoffs, as well as disappointing financial results. There is also speculation that rival Nvidia, which has been one of the main beneficiaries of the boom in demand for AI technology, will delay its latest product launch. Tech stocks lead declines as investors reconsider rally fuelled by artificial intelligence. The artificial intelligence chip giant briefly took the top spot from the software company this week. The company said it had sold all 75 million shares it had offered to investors. Indian stocks fall as it looks less likely that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party will be able to form a majority government. Shares in the video game retailer surge after an account tied to ""Roaring Kitty"" claimed a large stake. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

2,2024-08-06 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-06 05:36:42.000,Kamala Harris poised to announce her running mate,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2nnvlyvvmo,2024-08-05 22:15:07.000,"Vice-President Kamala Harris is expected to announce her running mate by Tuesday morning, ending two weeks of intense speculation as the US hurtles towards November's presidential election. Ms Harris interviewed several top contenders in Washington DC over the weekend, including Josh Shapiro, Tim Walz and Mark Kelly. Her choice will join her on a whirlwind five-day tour of seven cities this week as Ms Harris ramps up her campaign in key battleground states. The most recent poll from CBS, the BBC's US partner, shows Ms Harris and Trump in a tight race nationally, with the Democrat holding a one-point lead over her Republican challenger.  The poll released on Sunday shows Trump and Ms Harris tied in battleground states, where the former president held a five-point lead while Joe Biden remained in the race. Following the announcement expected on Tuesday morning, a campaign video will be released before Ms Harris and her new running mate jointly hold a rally in Philadelphia that evening. She reportedly met her vetting team - led by former US attorney general Eric Holder - over the weekend and received in-depth presentations on their findings, including potential political vulnerabilities. She met three of those candidates - Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro - on Sunday. She also met another top contender - Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg - on Friday and is understood to have spoken with other candidates virtually, US media report. On Monday afternoon, in response to a report that Ms Harris had made her pick, a campaign spokesperson, Kevin Munoz, wrote on social media that she was still deciding. ""We understand the excitement and interest here, but VP Harris has made no decision on a running mate yet!"" he said. It comes as the DNC finished a virtual roll call vote that saw Ms Harris officially become the first black and South Asian American nominee for a major US party's White House campaign. The Harris campaign has met with a flurry of lobbying efforts on behalf of - or criticising - the candidates. Mr Shapiro, for example, has drawn sharp opposition from some left-wing groups for his support of private school vouchers in Pennsylvania - a Republican-backed proposal to send $100m to families for private school tuition and school supplies - as well as his pro-Israel views.  The Philadelphia event will be followed by a string of campaign events across Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona, before ending with a campaign event in Las Vegas, Nevada, on 10 August. Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, have both suggested that Ms Harris' choice of running mate will ultimately have no impact on the upcoming election. In an episode of the ""Full Send"" podcast aired on Friday, Mr Vance said he believed the vice-presidential choice ""doesn't really matter, as much as this hits my ego"". ""People are going to vote primarily for Donald Trump or for Kamala Harris,"" he said. ""That's the way these things go."" Similarly, Trump has largely shrugged off questions about Ms Harris's choice, arguing last week that the vice-presidential role ""does not have any impact"". On Sunday, however, Trump criticised Mr Shapiro on Fox News, saying that Ms Harris could lose ""her little Palestinian base"" if she chooses him. Mr Shapiro, who during his student days wrote in a college magazine that Palestinians were ""too battle minded"", told reporters on Friday that he now supported a two-state solution.   Iran has vowed to respond to the killing of Hamas' political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last week. The storm is now expected to bring heavy flooding to parts of Georgia and the Carolinas in the coming days. The attack comes as the US warns the Middle East is at a critical moment after the killings of Hamas and Hezbollah senior leaders.

2,2024-08-06 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-06 05:36:42.000,UN staff fired over possible links to 7 October attack,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnvyyz8461yo,2024-08-05 19:47:19.000,"Nine staff members at the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, may have been involved in the 7 October Hamas-led attack on Israel, the United Nations says. All nine would have their employment terminated, said UN deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq. He said the UN had completed an investigation following allegations by Israel that UNRWA staff were involved. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages in the unprecedented assault last autumn. Since the attack, the Israeli military operation in Gaza has killed more than 38,400 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.  Mr Haq did not specify what the men's precise involvement may have been. ""For us, any participation in the attacks is a tremendous betrayal of the sort of work that we are supposed to be doing on behalf of the Palestinian people,"" he said. An Israeli Defense Forces spokeperson said the report showed UNRWA had hit a ""new low"". The UN investigated 19 members of UNRWA staff in all, after Israel alleged that 12 took part in the attack. Israel later claimed that more than 450 UNRWA staff were members of terrorist groups, but a UN review published in April found Israel had not provided evidence for its claims. Aside from the nine employees who the UN said may have had links to the 7 October attack, its report found no evidence of involvement in one case, and insufficient evidence in the case of nine others. UNRWA, which employs 13,000 people in Gaza, said in March that some of its employees reported being pressured by Israeli authorities into making false statements while in detention. Most countries withdrew funding for the UN agency because of the Israeli allegations. In July, the UK joined other countries that had resumed funding since then, leaving the US, UNRWA's single biggest donor, as the only country not to have restarted donations. UNRWA has provided aid for Palestinian refugees since 1949. Iran has vowed to respond to the killing of Hamas' political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last week. Fears grow that Iran may attack Israel after high-profile assassinations, with Hezbollah in Lebanon joining. Rescuers in Gaza say most of the dead were women and children, but Israel insists it targeted Hamas. Protesters blocked the drink brand's float, causing the parade to be rerouted. Iran says it will ""punish"" Israel for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

2,2024-08-06 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-06 05:36:42.000,Usha Vance defends husband's 'childless cat ladies' remark,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyllnwjze8o,2024-08-06 00:07:39.000,"Usha Vance is defending controversial comments made by her husband, Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance, about ""childless cat ladies"", telling Fox News that she thought critics had taken the remarks too seriously. Mr Vance initially made the controversial remarks in a 2021 interview. He argued those without children shouldn't be leading the country and that women who don't have kids are ""miserable"". The comments resurfaced after former President Donald Trump chose Mr Vance as his running mate. The backlash - from critics including the actress Jennifer Aniston - was swift, and so was Mr Vance's defence of his words. Now, Ms Vance has weighed in, telling Fox News that the remarks were a ""quip"" and she wished people would look at the larger context of what her husband said. Addressing criticism that his comments were insulting to those who struggle with fertility problems, she said Mr Vance would ""never, ever, ever want to say something to hurt someone who was trying to have a family, who really, was struggling with that"". She said she understands there ""are a lot of other reasons why people may choose not to have families and many of those reasons are very good"". Mr Vance was a candidate for Senate at the time of the 2021 interview, which also happened on Fox News. He told former channel host Tucker Carlson that the US is run by ""a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too"". He went on to question why a number of high-profile Democrats do not have children, including Kamala Harris who is now running to replace Joe Biden as president. Ms Harris is a step-mother to her husband Doug Emhoff's two children. JD Vance argued leaders without children were making choices for the future even though they ""don't really have a direct stake in it"". He also said those without children live in small apartments, chase wealth, careers and ""status"" and then end up ""hating"" those who have families and homes, whom he said are happier and better equipped to lead the country. Mr Vance, who has three children with Ms Vance, has since defended the remarks - particularly ""childless cat ladies"" - as a ""sarcastic comment"" in service of making his larger point. ""People are focusing so much on the sarcasm and not on the substance of what I actually said,"" Mr Vance told the conservative media personality Megyn Kelly. He said his remarks were not aimed at belittling people who do not have children, rather, they aimed to criticise the ""Democratic Party for becoming anti-family and anti-children,"" he told the host. Iran has vowed to respond to the killing of Hamas' political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last week. The storm is now expected to bring heavy flooding to parts of Georgia and the Carolinas in the coming days.

The attack comes as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Middle East was at a critical moment following the killings of senior leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah. Officials told the BBC’s partner CBS News that the Al Asad airbase in western Iraq was attacked and that they are still assessing the damage. They have not yet said who was behind the attack. Security sources told CBS that two Katyusha rockets were fired at the base, and that one had fallen inside the base. “We can confirm that there was a suspected rocket attack today against US and Coalition forces at Al Asad Airbase, Iraq,” said a Department of Defence spokesperson. “Initial indications are that several US personnel were injured. Base personnel are conducting a post-attack damage assessment,” the spokesperson added. It is unclear how many US personnel were injured. A senior US military official said no critical injuries, such as a loss of limbs, have been reported at this time, and no service members were killed. President Joe Biden was briefed on the suspected attack, a White House official said. In a statement on X, Mr Biden said he and vice-president Kamala Harris were briefed in the Situation Room on ""developments on the Middle East."" ""We received updates on threats posed by Iran and its proxies, diplomatic efforts to de-escalate regional tensions, and preparations to support Israel should it be attacked again,"" the president said. ""We also discussed the steps we are taking to defend our forces and respond to any attack against our personnel in a manner and place of our choosing."" The attack comes after the US carried out a strike in Iraq last week that was described as an act of self-defence against militants who officials said were preparing to launch drones against US and coalition forces in the region. Tensions have been escalating following the death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran last Wednesday by a blast at his guesthouse. Iran’s revolutionary guard (IRGC) has accused Israel of killing Haniyeh and said it was supported by the US. Israel has not commented on Haniyeh's death. Also last week, Israel said it killed a top Hezbollah commander in an air strike on a southern suburb of Beirut, Lebanon’s capital. Both Iran and Hezbollah have threatened to retaliate against Israel for the killings. The Al Asad base was attacked in January this year by Iranian-backed militias, who launched ballistic missiles and rockets - most of which were intercepted, US Central Command said at the time. A number of US personnel were assessed for traumatic brain injuries after the attack, while at least one Iraqi service member was wounded. The airbase has been used by the US since 2004, following the invasion of Iraq, and has been visited by former US presidents George W Bush and later Donald Trump.

The post was in response to a New York Times report about an email from X chief executive Linda Yaccarino to staff, which said the office was closing, with employees moving to San Jose and Palo Alto. It comes just weeks after Mr Musk said he would move X and his rocket company SpaceX to Texas. He said it was due to recent laws passed by the state - in particular a new law which prevents schools from making rules to require staff to tell anyone, including parents, information about a child's gender identity. ""No choice. It is impossible to operate in San Francisco if you’re processing payments,"" the technology entrepreneur said on X. ""That’s why Stripe, Block (CashApp) & others had to move,"" he added, hinting that it was local laws that triggered his decision. X did not immediately reply to a BBC News request for comment. In July, the multi-billionaire said the offices of X and SpaceX would move to Texas, after California introduced the new gender identity law. At the time, Mr Musk called it ""the last straw"" in a post on X. In response, California's Democrat Governor Gavin Newsom posted on X “You bent the knee,” along with a screenshot of a 2022 post from former President Donald Trump criticising the billionaire. In 2022, Mr Musk bought Twitter for $44bn (£34.4bn) and immediately set about making changes at the company, including cutting jobs and reducing content moderation on the platform. He moved Tesla's headquarters to Texas in 2021 and is a resident of the state - which has no income tax.

Debby is expected to bring heavy flooding to parts of Georgia and the Carolinas in the coming days. The National Hurricane Center warned of a ""life-threatening"" flood threat as the ""slow-moving storm"" drops ""torrential rains"". Debby made landfall on Monday morning as a category one hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida's Gulf Coast. Authorities said the dead included a 13-year-old boy who was killed when a tree fell on to a mobile home in the town of Levy County, located near Gainesville. In Hillsborough County – around Tampa - an 18-wheel lorry veered into a canal during the storm. The driver was found dead. In Dixie County, just west of Gainesville, officials reported that a woman and a 12-year-old were killed when their car crashed on Sunday night. In southern Georgia, another death - a 19-year-old - was reported after a large tree fell on to a porch at a home in Moultrie, local media reported. The slow-moving pace of the storm could bring “catastrophic flooding”, Jamie Rhome, the deputy director of the hurricane centre, said. Debby’s waves and strong winds helped blow 25 packages of cocaine, worth more than $1m, ashore in the Florida Keys, according to the US Border Patrol. In Florida, some 150,000 homes and businesses were without power on Monday night, according to PowerOutage.com. Another 36,000 residents in Georgia and South Carolina were experiencing outages. The storm is forecast to skim the coast, drenching south-east Georgia and the Carolinas on Tuesday and Wednesday, before moving inland near the South Carolina coast on Thursday. Before the storm made landfall, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for 61 of Florida's 67 counties. Spyridon Aibejeris told USA Today repairs on his Keaton Beach home had just wrapped up two weeks ago from Hurricane Idalia, a category three storm that made landfall last summer. “Man, I’ve done this so many times,"" Mr Aibejeris said. Forecasters predicted this hurricane season, which runs from 1 June to 30 November, would be a busy one. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) said there could be up to 25 named storms in 2024. Between eight and 13 of those storms could develop into hurricanes. Debby was the fourth named storm of the year. It is thought that climate change may be making slow-moving hurricanes like this more likely. As the world heats unevenly, this causes changes in the atmospheric circulations that steer storms across the planet.

Glen Malcolm Conning, 50, was killed by a pro-independence group known as Free Papua Organisation (OPM), according to police. OPM spokesman Sebby Sambom told the BBC that he had not been able to verify the Indonesian authorities' claim. It comes nearly a year and a half after the abduction of another pilot from New Zealand, Phillip Mehrtens, who remains in captivity. Authorities say the group responsible for Mr Conning's death is the same that is holding Mr Mehrtens. Mr Conning was killed when rebels rounded up those on board the helicopter, including four passengers, after they landed in an isolated area in the Central Papua province, police said in a statement. The passengers are reported to be safe. The spokesperson for the police special operation in Papua, Bayu Suseno, claimed the pilot's body was taken to the helicopter and then burned along with the aircraft in Alama District, which can only by accessed by helicopter. Mr Conning was shuttling passengers for a private company. OPM spokesman Mr Sambom told the BBC that despite being unable to verify the claims, ""if it was true, then the pilot is a spy because we have declared that the area is a war zone"". In February 2023, separatist fighters in Indonesia's Papua region took another New Zealand pilot hostage. Phillip Mehrtens, 37, was captured shortly after landing his plane in the remote mountainous area of Nduga to drop off passengers. Since then, Mr Mehrtens has been held captive by West Papua National Liberation Army fighters (TPNPB) - the armed wing of the OPM - who also attacked a number of Indonesian troops sent to rescue him, killing at least one. These hostile acts come in the context of a long-running, often brutally violent conflict between the Indonesian government and West Papua's indigenous people. Papuan rebels have been seeking independence from Indonesia for decades, and have previously issued threats and attacked aircraft which they believe are carrying personnel and supplies for Jakarta, the country's capital.  The region is divided into six provinces and is separate from independent Papua New Guinea. Previously a Dutch colony, West Papua declared independence in 1961. However, Indonesia took over two years later and was formally given control in a UN-supervised vote in 1969. The UN vote is widely considered illegitimate as only about 1,000 Papuans took part in it. A pro-independence movement began shortly afterwards, which continues to this day. The airline blamed difficulties securing more efficient aircraft and sustainable jet fuel.

Warsame Ahmed Gelle told state TV that authorities have been conducting operations to ""fight"" the veils, also known as niqabs. The crackdown was sparked by concerns that jihadists could conceal their identity and carry out attacks, Mr Warsame said. Large parts of southern and central Somalia are controlled by al-Shabab, which is affiliated to al-Qaeda and has waged a brutal insurgency for nearly 20 years against the UN-backed government in Somalia. On Friday dozens were killed in an attack at a popular beachfront location in Mogadishu, the capital. Officers in Kismayo have been confiscating the veils by stopping women in the streets and forcing them to remove the garment. The operation began last Wednesday, Mr Wasame said. Women caught wearing the niqab, which covers the whole face expect for the eyes, also face jail or a fine. Because al-Shabab controls much of southern Somalia, Kismayo and its surrounding areas are the only places in the state of Jubaland where authorities can enforce the ban. The state initially introduced the niqab ban in 2013, citing security risks, but it was rarely enforced. Niqabs are seen as a sign of modesty in Islam - a religion which, according to government statistics, is practised by 99% of Somalia's population. Many women there wear the niqab and Mr Wasame said the garment had increased in popularity recently. However most Somali women still opt for the hijab, which covers a woman's hair but not her face. The police said at least 37 people were killed during Friday's beachfront attack and several more were wounded. Al-Shabab, who claimed responsibility for the attack, said the death toll and injuries are much higher than figures released by the police. The Somali military recently killed dozens of jihadist fighters in Jubaland so reprisal attacks are a possibility.

2,2024-08-06 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-06 05:36:42.000,"Supreme Court justice didn't disclose travel, says senator",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yddp16eqjo,2024-08-05 23:28:00.000,"Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has been accused by a top Democratic senator of failing to disclose two flights on a private jet owned by a billionaire Republican donor. Ron Wyden, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said that Justice Thomas did not declare a roundtrip from Hawaii to New Zealand with his wife on Harlan Crow's private jet in 2010. He used a letter to Mr Crow's lawyer to accuse the property mogul of ""showering a public official with extravagant gifts then writing off those gifts to lower his tax"". A spokesman for Mr Crow told US media Mr Wyden's inquiries had ""no legal basis and are only intended to harass a private citizen"", and that Mr Crow had ""always followed applicable tax law"". ""It’s concerning that Senator Wyden is abusing his committee’s powers as part of a politically motivated campaign against the Supreme Court,"" said a spokesman for Mr Crow, Michael Zona. Justice Thomas has not commented publicly on the letter. The Supreme Court did not immediately respond to an inquiry from the BBC. Justice Thomas has previously said that he believed he did not need to report trips with close friends who do not have business before the Supreme Court. It is the latest criticism against the conservative judge, whose previous travel on private jets and yachts have previously come under scrutiny. Under a new disclosure system, the judge in June amended his annual statement to include two trips with Mr Crow in 2019 - one to Bali and another to California. However, Mr Wyden alleged in his letter that the judge had used private jets paid for by Mr Crow at least 17 times in the last eight years. The Oregon senator also cited a new trip that he said had not been reported publicly. Mr Wyden cited US Customs and Border Protection records of a trip from Hawaii to New Zealand in 2010 by the judge and his wife, Virginia, on Mr Crow's private jet. The White House said Mr Wyden's letter strengthened President Joe Biden's case for sweeping reforms to the court, which is currently dominated by conservatives. Mr Biden last week proposed establishing term limits for justices, which are currently lifetime appointments, and an enforceable code of conduct. Such changes would be difficult to pass in Congress. The White House said on Monday that ""the most powerful court in the United States shouldn't be subject to the lowest ethical standards, and conflicts of interest on the Supreme Court cannot go unchecked"". The heightened focus on court ethics has drawn scrutiny to other Supreme Court members. It emerged last year that Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a liberal, did not recuse herself from three cases involving Penguin Random House, which had paid her more than $3m (£2.4m). Iran has vowed to respond to the killing of Hamas' political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last week. The storm is now expected to bring heavy flooding to parts of Georgia and the Carolinas in the coming days. The attack comes as the US warns the Middle East is at a critical moment after the killings of Hamas and Hezbollah senior leaders. Ms Vance says it was a ""quip"" and she wants people to understand her husband's larger argument. Bizarre headlines, a new opponent and limited cash have left the independent candidate struggling.

2,2024-08-06 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-06 05:36:42.000,Biles achieves 'more than wildest dreams' in Paris,https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/articles/c80eelg3n9no,2024-08-05 11:38:26.000,"This video can not be played Brazil's Andrade secures gold medal in women's floor final Simone Biles says she has achieved more than her wildest dreams despite the errors in two finals on Monday that cost her the chance to add more Olympic gold medals to the three she had already won in Paris. The 27-year-old American - who won team, all-around and vault gold - twice landed with both feet outside the area to take silver behind Brazil's Rebeca Andrade on floor. That came after she had fallen off the beam to finish fifth in what she called an ""odd"" final during which she was frustrated by ""shushing"" in the crowd. Three years after pulling out of several events in Tokyo and wondering if she would ever compete again, the world's most decorated gymnast now has 11 Olympic medals to add to her 30 World Championship ones. ""I'm not upset about my performance, I'm actually happy, proud and even more excited that it's over, the stress of it,"" Biles told a packed news conference. ""I've accomplished way more than my wildest dreams, not just at this Olympics but in the sport, so I can't be mad at my performances. ""I'm pretty proud of myself and it's always so exciting to compete."" 'She's a queen' - Biles bows to Andrade in iconic medal moment 'No flashbacks' - the moment Biles was sure about gold This video can not be played Team USA's Biles fails to win medal after falling in gymnastics balance beam final Andrade had the crowd at the Bercy Arena on its feet with her lively routine, setting an early mark as the second gymnast to go in the floor final. Biles, who was frustrated with the crowd during the beam final, seemed to have shaken off her disappointment and made a brilliant start on floor with a powerful and perfectly landed triple twisting double somersault. But such is the height and power she gets on her tumbles it can sometimes work against her. She landed with both feet outside the floor area twice, costing her 0.300 apiece, and scored 14.133 to sit 0.033 behind Andrade. Usually, Biles' difficulty level - which was a full mark higher than Andrade's - can get her out of trouble if she has a messy landing - but these were too bad. One foot out of the area would only have been a 0.100 deduction. Add into the mix that Andrade, 25, executed her routine almost flawlessly, there is no doubt that this was a well deserved gold for the Brazilian - a fact underlined by Biles and bronze medallist Jordan Chiles bowing to her on the podium. ""First, it was an all-black podium so that was super exciting for us but then Jordan was like 'should we bow to her?' and I was like 'absolutely',"" Biles said. ""She's such an excitement to watch. It was just the right thing to do."" After beating Andrade to the all-around title last week, Biles had praised her rival saying she was the only gymnast who had ever come close to her. She was right, although this time she was beaten as Andrade completed her set of a medal of every colour in Paris after all-around silver and team bronze. With her 11th Olympic gymnastics medal, Biles has drawn level with Czech Vera Caslavska in second on the women's all-time list. The all-time leader is Soviet gymnast Larisa Latynina with 18.  This video can not be played Biles speaks about 'weird and awkward' Paris atmosphere after beam fall Biles' day had not got off to the best start in a beam final during which she was among half of the eight gymnasts in the competition who fell off the 10cm wide apparatus in an event won by Italy's Alice d'Amato. She lost her balance at the end of an aerial series and at the conclusion of the routine looked unhappy with the crowd, speaking animatedly to her coach and her team-mate Sunisa Lee. Shouts of ""come on Simone"" while she performed drew ""shush"" sounds from others in the audience and she later explained gymnasts usually prefer to have some sort of music or background noise, because those are the conditions they are used to in training. ""Beam final is always the most stressful,"" Biles said. ""Today you could hear some of the Android ringtones going off, photo clickers, whatever that was and you try to stay in your zone, and then people start cheering and the shushing gets louder - but really they should be shushed because they're louder. ""It was really weird and awkward and we've asked several times if we can have some music or some background noise but I'm not really sure what happened there. None of us liked it. It was an odd beam final."" Lee, another of the four gymnasts to fall off the beam, said: ""You could feel the tension in the room. ""The crowd shushing us for cheering. We didn't like that as it was just so silent in there. I love hearing my team-mates cheer for me. Simone and I were both upset."" It was a brilliant gold for Italy's D'Amato, who won with 14.366. China's Zhou Yaqin took silver with 14.100 and another Italian, Manila Esposito got the bronze with 14.000.  Biles leaves Paris with the medals she was expected to win in Tokyo. After a sparkling Olympic debut at Rio 2016, when she won four golds, she had arrived in Japan hot favourite to add many more before the 'twisties' struck during the team final, causing her to sit out the rest of that event before pulling out of all her individual finals apart from beam, where she took an emotional bronze. She has spoken in depth about the pressure she had been under going into Tokyo, her struggles without her family there, the ""scars"" of the ""horrific abuse"" by former USA team doctor Larry Nassar and the impact of the critics who called her a ""quitter"". And she has detailed just what it had taken to get her to Paris, where she has performed in front of a packed-out arena each time - and featuring A-listers to boot - with the camera lenses focused on her every move. She returned to gymnastics last summer after a two-year break, focusing on her therapy sessions as much as her acrobatic skills. She has continued them more regularly in Paris before her events, normalising even more a conversation about mental health that she so dramatically opened up in Tokyo. ""It's really important that we put our mental health first and then everything else will fall into place,"" she said on Monday. She came to Paris with her team taking off as much pressure as possible but from the moment she successfully landed her vault in the team final - without ""flashbacks"" to Tokyo - she has not looked back. The team gold was ""redemption"", the all-around gold was for herself and then after that she said it was about enjoying herself. With that came a vault gold, a floor silver and a successful return to the top of her sport.  Biles has urged people in recent days to stop asking athletes ""what next"" after they win a medal, telling them in a social media post to ""let us soak up the moment we’ve worked our whole lives for"". She has not ruled out competing at her home Games in Los Angeles in 2028 but says she is ""getting old"" as she will be 31 by then. Not that age has stood in her way in Paris, where she became the oldest gymnast to win the women's all-around title in 72 years in a sport where the past 12 champions had been teenagers.

Unknown gunmen shot Alejandro Martínez as he was travelling in a car with two security guards in the central state of Guanajuato. Mr Martínez, who was known as ""The Son of the Lone Ranger"", died in hospital from the bullet wounds he sustained in the attack. Mexico is one of the world's most dangerous countries for journalists, with over 150 media workers killed since 1994, according to campaign group Reporters Without Borders. Mr Martínez, who was in his 50s, ran a popular news outlet on Facebook, which has more than 340,000 followers. He had been under police protection after surviving a similar attack on his life in 2022. Local authorities said the attackers opened fire from a pickup truck on the car carrying the journalist and his bodyguards. Police sources told AFP news agency that the bodyguards returned fire but could not save the reporter, who was hit by a bullet in the head. A woman in another car was also struck and wounded by a stray bullet, sources said. In an interview three years ago, Mr Martínez said he felt incredible pain and sadness witnessing the damage done to the region by increasing levels of violence. Balbina Flores from Reporters Without Borders in Mexico told AFP that ""he was a journalist who was at risk"". He had been assigned bodyguards under a federal programme for reporters who receive death threats, a government official said. His shooting is the latest in a string of deadly attacks on journalists. Earlier this month, Federico Hans, a journalist in the town of Caborca in northern Sonora state, was shot and wounded as he got into his car outside his home. And on 29 June, Víctor Culebro was found dead along a highway in the southern state of Chiapas. The figures have dropped dramatically since December, when there were around 250,000 apprehensions.

2,2024-08-06 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-06 05:36:42.000,Calls for foreigners to leave Lebanon as war fears grow,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80xxeqel5po,2024-08-05 09:53:39.000,"Several countries have urged their nationals to leave Lebanon, as fears grow of a wider conflict in the Middle East. Iran has vowed “severe” retaliation against Israel, which it blames for the death of Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on Wednesday. Israel has not commented. His assassination came hours after Israel killed Hezbollah senior commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut. Western officials fear that Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militia and political movement based in Lebanon, could play a key role in any such retaliation, which in turn could spark a serious Israeli response.  Diplomatic efforts by the US and other Western countries continue to try to de-escalate tensions across the region. A growing number of flights have been cancelled or suspended at the country’s only commercial airport in Beirut. The US, the UK, Australia, France, Canada, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Turkey and Jordan are among the countries to have urged their citizens to leave Lebanon as soon as possible. Fears of an escalation of hostilities that could engulf Lebanon are at their highest since Hezbollah stepped up its attacks on Israel, a day after the deadly Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October, in support for Palestinians in Gaza. Most of the violence has been contained to border areas, with both sides indicating not being interested in a wider conflict. Hezbollah, however, has vowed to respond to Shukr’s assassination, which happened in Dahiyeh, the group’s stronghold in Beirut’s southern suburbs. It came after 12 children and teenagers were killed in a strike on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, which Israel blamed on Hezbollah. Israel said Shukr was behind it. Meanwhile there has been continuing firing between the two sides. Hezbollah said it launched drones at a military barracks in Ayelet HaShahar, northern Israel, in the early hours of Monday morning. The Israeli military said two soldiers were wounded. It came a day after Hezbollah launched dozens of rockets at the nearby town of Beit Hillel. There were no reports of casualties from that attack. Israel’s air force responded by striking targets in southern Lebanon. A Hezbollah fighter and a paramedic were killed in a strike on the town of Mays al-Jabal, less than a mile from the border with Israel. In a separate development on Sunday morning, two people were killed in a stabbing attack in the Israeli city of Holon. The attacker, a Palestinian from the occupied West Bank, was later “neutralised”, police said. Also on Sunday, officials from the Hamas-run ministry of health in Gaza said an Israeli air strike had hit a tent inside a hospital, killing at least five people. The officials said 19 Palestinians had been killed across the day. In a statement on Saturday, the US embassy in Beirut said those who chose to stay in Lebanon should “prepare contingency plans” and be prepared to “shelter in place for an extended period of time”. The Pentagon has said it is deploying additional warships and fighter jets to the region to help defend Israel from possible attacks by Iran and its proxies, a strategy similar to the one adopted in April, when Iran launched more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel in retaliation to an attack on its diplomatic compound in Syria. It blamed Israel for that strike. Many fear Iran’s retaliation on this occasion could take a similar form. The UK says it is sending extra military personnel, consular staff and border force officials to help with any evacuations. It has urged UK citizens to leave Lebanon while commercial flights are running. Two British military ships are already in the region and the Royal Air Force has put transport helicopters on standby. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the regional situation “could deteriorate rapidly”. In a phone call with EU Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell on Friday, Iran's Acting Foreign Minister Ali Baqeri Kani said Iran would ""undoubtedly use its inherent and legitimate right"" to ""punish"" Israel. On Friday, an announcer on Iran's state TV warned ""the world would witness extraordinary scenes"". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Israelis that ""challenging days lie ahead... We have heard threats from all sides. We are prepared for any scenario"". Tensions escalated after a rocket strike on a football pitch in the occupied Golan Heights killed 12 children and teenagers. Israel accused Hezbollah and vowed “severe” retaliation, though Hezbollah denied it was involved. Days later, Shukr, who was a close adviser to the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in a targeted Israeli air strike in Beirut. Four others, including two children, were also killed. Hours after that, Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Iran, Hamas's main backer. He was visiting to attend the inauguration of Iran's new president, Masoud Pezeshkian. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has said Israel will suffer a “harsh punishment” for the killing. Haniyeh's assassination dealt a blow to the negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza, the main hope to defuse tensions along the Lebanon-Israel border. The war began in October when Hamas carried out an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. The attack triggered a massive Israeli military response, which has killed at least 39,480 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The attack comes as the US warns the Middle East is at a critical moment after the killings of Hamas and Hezbollah senior leaders. Western media reports suggest Israel's secret service planted bombs inside the building Ismail Haniyeh was staying in. Iran says it will ""punish"" Israel for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. The killing of Hezbollah and Hamas leaders crossed ""red lines"", Hassan Nasrallah says, but he stops short of declaring all-out war. Iran has threatened “harsh punishment” for Israel, which it blames for Ismail Haniyeh's assassination in Tehran. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

The clip, posted on X account on Sunday, shows the independent presidential candidate describing to US actress Roseanne Barr the incident that mystified New Yorkers 10 years ago. Mr Kennedy said a woman had killed the bear with her car when he was driving outside the city, and he put it in his van with the intention of harvesting its meat. He shared the anecdote as the New Yorker magazine published a story about the incident on Monday. According to the New Yorker, Mr Kennedy was ""tickled"" by the discovery of the bear while heading to a falconry outing in the rural Hudson River Valley. An image included in the article shows Mr Kennedy grimacing with his hand inside the dead bear's mouth after he loaded the carcass in the back of his car. The magazine quoted an anonymous source as saying that Mr Kennedy ""thought it would be funny to make it look like an errant cyclist"" had killed it. The account is broadly similar to the one provided by Mr Kennedy on Sunday. In his video, Mr Kennedy tells Barr that he was driving to go falcon-hunting near Goshen, New York in 2014 when the bear was killed. ""I was going to skin the bear... and I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator,"" he says. ""And you can do that in New York state: Get a bear tag for a roadkill bear."" New York state allows for roadkill to be taken, but authorities must be notified. Mr Kennedy does not appear to have done that. Instead, he says he continued to his falconry event, then went on to dinner at Peter Luger Steakhouse in New York City, about 75 miles (121km) south of Goshen. ""At the end of the dinner, it was late and I realised I couldn't go home,"" Mr Kennedy says. ""I had to go to the airport, and the bear was in my car, and I didn't want to leave the bear in my car because that would have been bad."" That is when, he says, it occurred to him that there had been a series of bicycle accidents in New York and that he had an old bicycle in his car. ""We thought it would be amusing for whoever found it,"" he says. ""The next day... it was on every television station. It was a front page of every paper and I turned on the TV and there was like a mile of yellow tape and 20 cop cars, there were helicopters flying, and I was like, 'Oh my God. What did I do?'"" He then notes that a fact-checker from the New Yorker called him and asked whether he was involved, which appears to have prompted him to release this video. The bear's corpse was discovered by a woman walking her dog, The New York Times said in its 2014 story. The carcass had been placed under some bushes and an abandoned bicycle. New York's Department of Environmental Conservation told the BBC on Monday that an investigation determined the bear had died from a high-speed collision. It added that charges cannot be brought for incidents more than a year old. The Times' story from 2014 was written by a one of Mr Kennedy's relatives - Tatiana Schlossberg, the granddaughter of former president John F Kennedy. Mr Kennedy's story comes as support for his presidential campaign has dwindled to single digits in polls since Kamala Harris entered the race for the Democrats. He maintains that he has no intention of ending his presidential bid. Iran has vowed to respond to the killing of Hamas' political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last week. The storm is now expected to bring heavy flooding to parts of Georgia and the Carolinas in the coming days. The attack comes as the US warns the Middle East is at a critical moment after the killings of Hamas and Hezbollah senior leaders. The Republican megadonor who's said to have funded the trip says it is a politically motivated attack by Democrats. More than 200 water rescues have been carried out since the weather system made landfall. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

2,2024-08-06 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-06 05:36:42.000,"Blindfolded, bound and beaten: Palestinians tell of Israeli jail abuse",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2yylgze4ro,2024-08-05 20:03:06.000,"Warning: This article contains details which some readers may find upsetting Israel’s leading human rights organisation says conditions inside Israeli prisons holding Palestinian detainees amount to torture. B’tselem’s report entitled “Welcome to Hell”, contains testimony from 55 recently released Palestinian detainees, whose graphic testimony points to a dramatic worsening of conditions inside prisons since the start of the Gaza war 10 months ago. It's the latest in a series of reports, including one last week by the UN, which contain shocking allegations of abuse directed against Palestinian prisoners. B’tselem says the testimony their researchers have gathered is remarkably consistent. “All of them again and again, told us the same thing,” says Yuli Novak, B’tselem’s executive director. “Ongoing abuse, daily violence, physical violence and mental violence, humiliation, sleep deprivation, people are starved.” Ms Novak’s conclusion is stark. “The Israeli prison system as a whole, in regard to Palestinians, turned into a network of torture camps.” Since the deadly Hamas attacks of 7 October, in which around 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals were killed, the number of Palestinian detainees has doubled to around 10,000. Israel’s prisons - some run by the army, others by the country’s prison service - have become overwhelmed. Jails are overflowing, with a dozen or more inmates sometimes sharing cells designed to accommodate no more than six. B’tselem’s report describes overcrowded, filthy cells, where some inmates are forced to sleep on the floor, sometimes without mattresses or blankets. Some prisoners were captured in the immediate aftermath of the Hamas attacks. Others were rounded up in Gaza as Israel’s invasion got under way, or were arrested in Israel or the occupied West Bank. Many were later released without charge. Firas Hassan was already in jail in October, held under “administrative detention”, a measure by which suspects – though it has overwhelmingly been applied to Palestinians - can be detained, more or less indefinitely, without charge. Israel says that its use of the policy is necessary, and compliant with international law. Firas says he saw with his own eyes how conditions quickly deteriorated after 7 October. “Life totally changed,” he told me when we met in Tuqu’, a West Bank village south of Bethlehem. “I call what happened a tsunami.” Mr Hassan has been in and out of jail since the early nineties, twice charged with membership of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an armed group designated as a terrorist organisation by Israel and much of the West. He makes no secret of his past affiliation, saying he was “active”. Familiar with the rigours of life in prison, he said nothing prepared him for what happened when officers entered his cell two days after 7 October. “We were severely beaten by 20 officers, masked men using batons and sticks, dogs and firearms,” he said. “We were tied from behind, our eyes blindfolded, beaten severely. Blood was gushing from my face. They kept beating us for 50 minutes. I saw them from under the blindfold. They were filming us while beating us.” Mr Hassan was eventually released, without charge, in April, by which time he said he had lost 3 stone (20kg). A video filmed on the day of his release shows a gaunt figure. “I spent 13 years in prison in the past,” he told B’tselem researchers later that month, “and never experienced anything like that.” But it’s not just Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank who talk about the abuse in Israeli prisons. Israeli citizens, like Sari Khourieh, an Israeli Arab lawyer from Haifa, say it has also happened to them. Mr Khourieh was held at the Megiddo prison in northern Israel for 10 days last November. The police said that two of his Facebook posts had glorified the actions of Hamas – a charge quickly dismissed. But his brief experience of prison – his first – nearly broke him. “They just lost their mind,” he says of the scenes he witnessed at Megiddo. “There was no law. There was no order inside.” Mr Khourieh says he was spared the worst of the abuse. But he says he was stunned by the treatment of his fellow inmates. “They were hitting them badly for no reason,” he told us. “They were screaming, the guys, ‘we didn't do nothing. You don't have to hit us.’” Speaking to other detainees, he quickly learned that what he was seeing was not normal. “It wasn’t the best treatment before 7 October, they told me, but afterwards everything was different.” During a brief spell in an area of isolation cells known by the prisoners as Tora Bora (a reference to al-Qaeda’s network of caves in Afghanistan), Mr Khourieh says he heard a beaten inmate pleading for medical help in an adjacent cell. According to Mr Khourieh, doctors tried to revive him, but he died shortly afterwards. According to last week’s UN report, “announcements by IPS (Israel Prison Service) and prisoners organisations indicate that 17 Palestinians have died in the custody of the IPS between 7 October and 15 May”. Israel’s military advocate, meanwhile, said on 26 May that it was investigating the deaths of 35 Gaza detainees in army custody. Several months after Mr Khourieh’s release – again, without charge – the lawyer is still struggling to make sense of what he witnessed at Megiddo. “I’m an Israeli…I’m a lawyer,” he told us. “I’ve seen the world outside the prison. Now I’m inside. I see another world.” His faith in citizenship and the rule of law, he says, has been shattered. “It was all crushed after this experience.” We put claims of the widespread mistreatment of Palestinian detainees to the authorities involved. The army said it “rejects outright allegations of systematic abuse of detainees”. “Concrete complaints regarding misconduct or unsatisfactory conditions of detention,” the army told us, “are forwarded to relevant bodies in the IDF, and are dealt with accordingly.” The prison service said it “was not aware of the claims you described, and as far as we know, no such events have occurred”. Since 7 October, Israel has refused to grant the International Committee of the Red Cross access to Palestinian detainees, as international law requires. No explanation has been given for this refusal, but the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has frequently expressed its frustration over the ICRC’s failure to gain access to Israeli and other hostages being held in Gaza. The Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI) has accused the government of “consciously defying international law”. Last week, the treatment of Palestinian prisoners ignited a furious public row, as far right demonstrators – including members of Israel’s parliament – violently tried to prevent the arrest of soldiers accused of sexually abusing a prisoner from Gaza at the Sde Teiman military base. Some of those protesting were followers of Israel’s hardline security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, the man in overall charge of the prison service. Mr Ben Gvir has frequently boasted that under his watch, conditions for Palestinian detainees have deteriorated sharply. “I’m proud that during my time we changed all the conditions,” he told members of Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, during a rowdy session in July. For B’Tselem, Mr Ben Gvir bears a heavy responsibility for the abuses now being reported. “These systems were put in the hands of the most right wing, most racist minister that Israel ever had,” Yuli Novak told us. For her, Israel’s treatment of prisoners, in the wake of the traumatic events of 7 October, is a dangerous indicator of the nation’s moral decline. “The trauma and anxiety walks with us each and every day,” she says. “But to let this thing turn us into something that it not human, that doesn’t see people, I think is tragic.” Iran has vowed to respond to the killing of Hamas' political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last week. Fears grow that Iran may attack Israel after high-profile assassinations, with Hezbollah in Lebanon joining. Rescuers in Gaza say most of the dead were women and children, but Israel insists it targeted Hamas. Protesters blocked the drink brand's float, causing the parade to be rerouted. Iran says it will ""punish"" Israel for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

2,2024-08-06 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-06 05:36:42.000,Dead bear another strange twist in RFK Jr's faltering campaign,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mnn8zneppo,2024-08-05 23:38:44.000,"Robert F Kennedy Jr's independent White House bid was buoyed by Democratic Party chaos and dissatisfaction with two familiar candidates. But bizarre headlines, a new opponent and limited cash have left him struggling. The 70-year-old's recent confession about dumping a dead bear in Central Park is just the latest strange twist to a campaign that was already sagging in the polls. Mr Kennedy seems determined to test the proposition that there’s no such thing as bad publicity. In a move to get ahead of a lengthy profile published on Monday in the New Yorker magazine, he released a video where he discusses an accident involving a bear cub a decade ago – and the unlikely series of events that followed. In the video, Mr Kennedy is speaking to actress and comedian Roseanne Barr over a half-eaten meal of takeaway beef ribs. He describes how he watched a nearby car hit and kill a bear cub while on a day trip hunting with a falcon. He said he initially wanted to take the dead animal home and skin it. After his schedule changed, he decided to discard the carcass in New York City’s Central Park – along with an old bicycle, in an effort to make it look like a cycling accident. When someone discovered the bear and the bicycle the next day, it became a headline story in the New York City tabloids and television news programmes. Needless to say, the entire episode - which sounds like a youthful practical joke gone wrong, but took place when the candidate was 60 - is odd. The falconry trip. The photograph, published in the New Yorker, of RFK Jr posing with the dead bear. The planned skinning and eating. The animal's final resting place in New York’s famous urban park. Even the video itself with Ms Barr – who has herself been embroiled in more than a few controversies – holding a teacup and nodding along as Mr Kennedy recounted his tale. His explanation, that the decision to pick up the dead bear was his “little bit of redneck” coming out, doesn’t quite fit for the nephew of former President John F Kennedy – a member of an American political dynasty. All this is standard fare for Mr Kennedy, however, whose top news lines during his campaign have veered from scandalous to plain bizarre. In May, the New York Times ran an article revealing he had told lawyers involved in his 2012 divorce proceedings that he was suffering from a memory issue relating to a dead brain parasite. In mid-July, Mr Kennedy texted an apology to a former family nanny after Vanity Fair magazine published a story in which she accused him of unwelcome sexual advances. “I have no memory of this incident but I apologise sincerely for anything I ever did that made you feel uncomfortable,” he wrote. In comments to the media, he said the Vanity Fair article contained a lot of “garbage” but conceded that he had a “very, very rambunctious youth” and that he was “not a church boy”.  There was a point earlier this year when Mr Kennedy – who launched his independent presidential bid after initially running for the Democratic nomination – was averaging around 15% in presidential preference polls. He narrowly missed qualifying for the first presidential debate in late June. Mr Kennedy appeared to be capitalising on voter dissatisfaction with both Donald Trump and Joe Biden. His pitch blended anti-establishment and anti-corporate rhetoric with liberal social positions and a heavy dose of environmentalism and controversial vaccine scepticism. With Mr Biden’s dismal performance during that first debate, the door may have opened for Mr Kennedy to elbow his way into the American political conversation. Instead, he virtually disappeared off the presidential campaign trial. He has spent little on advertising and grassroots organising. His biggest headlines involved the aforementioned brain worms, sex-harassment allegations and bear-cub escapades. Meanwhile, his polling support has dropped to the low single digits. According to Clifford Young, president of Ipsos public affairs, Mr Kennedy’s decline was inevitable, even without all distracting headlines. “He was a protest option,” he said. “There was a lot of indifference when it came to the two candidates. People didn’t like either choice and it was an expression of indifference or disdain.” Now, he says, Democrats and Republicans have consolidated their political support. Mr Kennedy was in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, during the Republican National Convention in late July, where he had a telephone conversation with the former president. According to media reports, Mr Kennedy offered to endorse the former president in exchange for a role in his next administration – an offer Trump declined. At this point, it seems unlikely that Mr Kennedy will generate much interest when Americans head to the polls in November. Even a modest performance could tip the presidential race, however, if that support comes in one of the key battleground states where the independent candidate is on the ballot. In 2016, Green Party candidate Jill Stein received more votes than the difference between Trump and Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan – the three decisive states in that race. If a fraction of Green Party candidate Ralph Nader’s Florida support had gone to the Democrats, Al Gore would have won the White House in 2000. Mr Young said Mr Kennedy’s appeal is different from those two notable Green Party candidates, however. He is pulling mostly from the disaffected centre of American politics – low propensity voters who tilt slightly to the right. The Green Party candidates, on the other hand, were damaging the Democrats by pulling almost exclusively from the left. Mr Kennedy could still play the spoiler, but it would have to be another extremely close race. And, in the meantime, his chance to shape his campaign’s direction on a larger scale seem to have been buried under an avalanche of strangeness. Iran has vowed to respond to the killing of Hamas' political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last week. The storm is now expected to bring heavy flooding to parts of Georgia and the Carolinas in the coming days. The attack comes as the US warns the Middle East is at a critical moment after the killings of Hamas and Hezbollah senior leaders. Ms Vance says it was a ""quip"" and she wants people to understand her husband's larger argument. The Republican megadonor who's said to have funded the trip says it is a politically motivated attack by Democrats. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

2,2024-08-06 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-06 05:36:42.000,Sheikh Hasina: The pro-democracy icon who became an autocrat,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg3ee303yxpo,2024-08-06 03:43:14.000,"Bangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed has resigned and left the country after weeks of student-led protests spiralled into deadly, nationwide unrest. The 76-year-old fled in a helicopter on Monday to India, reports said, as thousands of protesters stormed her official residence in the capital Dhaka. This brings an unexpected end to the reign of Bangladesh's longest-serving PM, who has been in power since 2009 and ruled the country for more than 20 years in total. Credited with overseeing the South Asian country's economic progress in recent years, Ms Hasina began her political career as a pro-democracy icon. However, in recent years she has been accused of turning autocratic and clamping down on any opposition to her rule. Politically-motivated arrests, disappearances, extra-judicial killings and other abuses have all risen under her rule. In January she won an unprecedented fourth term as PM in a January election widely decried by critics as being a sham and boycotted by the main opposition. Born to a Muslim family in East Bengal in 1947, Ms Hasina had politics in her blood. Her father was the nationalist leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh's ""Father of the Nation"" who led the country's independence from Pakistan in 1971 and became its first president. At that time, Ms Hasina had already established a reputation as a student leader at Dhaka University. Her father was assassinated with most of his family members in a military coup in 1975. Only Ms Hasina and her younger sister survived as they were travelling abroad at the time. After living in exile in India, Ms Hasina returned to Bangladesh in 1981 and became the leader of the political party her father belonged to, the Awami League. She joined hands with other political parties to hold pro-democracy street protests during the military rule of General Hussain Muhammed Ershad. Propelled by the popular uprising, Ms Hasina quickly became a national icon. She was first elected to power in 1996. She earned credit for signing a water-sharing deal with India and a peace deal with tribal insurgents in the south-east of the country. But at the same time, her government was criticised for numerous allegedly corrupt business deals and for being too subservient to India. She later lost to her former ally-turned-nemesis, Begum Khaleda Zia of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), in 2001. As heirs to political dynasties, both women dominated Bangladesh politics for more than three decades and used to be known as the ""battling begums"". Begum refers to a Muslim woman of high rank. Observers say their bitter rivalry resulted in bus bombs, disappearances and extrajudicial killings becoming regular occurrences. Ms Hasina eventually came back to power in 2009 in polls held under a caretaker government. A true political survivor, she endured numerous arrests while in opposition as well as several assassination attempts, including one in 2004 that damaged her hearing. She has also survived efforts to force her into exile and numerous court cases in which she has been accused of corruption. Bangladesh under Ms Hasina presents a contrasting picture. The Muslim-majority nation, once one of the world's poorest, has achieved credible economic success under her leadership since 2009. It's now one of the fastest-growing economies in the region, even surpassing its giant neighbour India. Its per capita income has tripled in the last decade and the World Bank estimates that more than 25 million people have been lifted out of poverty in the last 20 years. Much of this growth has been fuelled by the garment industry, which accounts for the vast majority of total exports from Bangladesh and has expanded rapidly in recent decades, supplying markets in Europe, North America and Asia. Using the country's own funds, loans and development assistance, Ms Hasina's government has also undertaken huge infrastructure projects, including the flagship $2.9bn Padma bridge across the Ganges. The latest protests were the most serious challenge Ms Hasina faced since taking office, and followed a highly controversial election in which her party was re-elected for a fourth straight parliamentary term. The unrest began with a demand to abolish quotas in civil service jobs but turned into a wider anti-government movement as she used the police to violently crack down on protesters, killing more than 200 and injuring many more. Amid increasing calls for her to resign, she had remained defiant. She condemned the agitators as “terrorists” and appealed for support to ""suppress these terrorists with a firm hand"". She also threw hundreds of people into jail and brought criminal charges against hundreds more. The agitation against quotas came as Bangladesh struggled with the escalating cost of living in the wake of the pandemic. Inflation has skyrocketed, the country's foreign exchange reserves have dropped precipitously, and its foreign debt has doubled since 2016. Critics blamed this on Ms Hasina's government's mismanagement, and say that Bangladesh's previous economic success only helped those close to Ms Hasina’s Awami League due to endemic corruption. They also say the country's economic progress came at the cost of democracy and human rights. Ms Hasina has long been accused of enacting repressive authoritarian measures against her political opponents, detractors and the media - a remarkable turnaround for a leader who once fought for multi-party democracy. Rights groups estimate there have been at least 600 cases of enforced disappearances, with hundreds more subject to extra-judicial killings, since Ms Hasina took power again in 2009. Bangladesh's security forces have also long been accused of serious abuse and torture, and in 2021 the US sanctioned the Rapid Action Battalion - a notorious elite unit of the police accused of carrying out brutal extra-judicial killings - citing human rights violations. Many human rights activists and journalists have faced increasing attacks including arrests, surveillance and harassment. Strict laws have been used against journalists which critics say has stifled press freedom.  Ms Hasina and her government are also accused of ""judicially harassing"" targets with court cases, such as economist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus. He was jailed earlier this year and faces more than 100 charges, in cases that his supporters say was politically motivated. In the lead-up to this year's election, many senior leaders from the BNP were arrested, along with thousands of supporters following anti-government protests, which rights groups say were an attempt to incapacitate the opposition. Ms Hasina's government has flatly denied claims of such abuses. But it has also severely restricted visits by foreign journalists wanting to investigate such allegations. Bangladesh is at a historic turning point after its PM of 15 years fled the country amid public anger. The stakes are high for India after PM Sheikh Hasina's sudden resignation and flight from Bangladesh. Bangladesh's embattled PM has resigned and fled to India amid massivem unprecedented protests. The protests, which began as a student movement against job quotas, have spiralled into nationwide unrest. The figure was released as students returned to the streets demanding justice for those killed. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

2,2024-08-06 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-06 05:36:42.000,Can India help its special ally Bangladesh defuse the crisis?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39kkkdjkzwo,2024-08-05 13:32:27.000,"The dramatic resignation of Bangladesh’s long-serving prime minister Sheikh Hasina and her flight to India ironically underscore the close ties between the two countries. Ms Hasina ruled Bangladesh, a nation of 170 million, for close to 15 years until a protest by students to abolish civil service quotas snowballed into a broader and violent anti-government movement. At least 280 people have died in clashes between police and anti-government protesters so far. Back in June, Ms Hasina visited India twice in two weeks. Her first visit was to attend Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's oath-taking ceremony. After that, she made a two-day state visit, the first by a head of government to India after Mr Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party-led coalition's third consecutive victory in parliamentary elections. ""We have met 10 times in the last one year. However, this meeting is special because Sheikh Hasina is the first state guest after the third term of our government,” Mr Modi said at a joint news conference. The bonhomie was unmistakable. “Bangladesh greatly values its relations with India,” said Ms Hasina. “Come to Bangladesh to witness what all we have done and plan to do”. India has a special relationship with Bangladesh. The neighbours share a 4,096km (2,545 miles)-border and linguistic, economic and cultural ties. Bangladesh, formerly East Pakistan, was born after a war in 1971 with West Pakistan (now Pakistan), with India supporting Bengali nationalists. Bilateral trade between the two countries is around $16bn (£12bn), with India being Bangladesh’s top export destination in Asia. To be sure, the ties are not perfect: differences arise over Bangladesh’s close relationship with China, border security, migration issues and some Bangladeshi officials' discomfort with Mr Modi’s Hindu nationalist politics. After Ms Hasina's resignation, Bangladesh's army chief Waker-uz-Zaman has announced plans for an interim government. He will meet President Mohammed Shahabuddin and reports say he's hoping for a solution by the day's end after speaking with opposition parties, led by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). Leadership of the interim government remains unclear. So far, India has only described the violent protests as an ""internal matter"" of Bangladesh. Can it say - and do - more about the unfolding developments? ""NOTHING. Nothing for now,"" wrote Happymon Jacob, an Indian foreign policy expert, on X (formerly Twitter) on what India should be doing. ""It is still unfolding. And, it's not about India; it's about politics in Bangladesh. Let them figure it out."" Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center, an American think-tank, believes Ms Hasina's resignation and flight are ""close to a worst-case scenario for India, as it has long viewed any alternative to Ms Hasina and her party as a threat to Indian interests"". Mr Kugelman told the BBC that Delhi will likely reach out to Bangladesh's military to convey its concerns and hope its interests are taken into account in an interim government. ""Beyond that, India will have to watch and wait nervously. It may support free and fair elections in the interest of stability, but it doesn’t want the BNP - even if it has grown weak and divided - to return. Delhi likely wouldn’t oppose a long period of interim rule for that reason."" Ms Hasina's sudden downfall would have caught her allies off guard. The daughter of Bangladesh's founding president and the world’s longest-serving female head of government, Ms Hasina led her country for nearly 15 years. She had overseen one of the world's fastest-growing economies and a major boost in living standards in South Asia. But her rule had also been marked by accusations of forced disappearances, extrajudicial killings and repression of the opposition. She and her party Awami League denied these charges, while her government blamed opposition parties for fuelling protests. In January, Ms Hasina won her fourth consecutive term in a controversial election. The opposition BNP boycotted the vote, and allegations of a rigged poll were compounded by mass arrests of its leaders and supporters. Some of the anti-India sentiment in Bangladesh stems from India's support for Ms Hasina's government, which critics view as interference in domestic politics. Historical grievances and accusations of overreach also contribute to some of the negative perception. Ali Riaz, a Bangladeshi-American political scientist at Illinois State University, told the BBC that India's silence is “not surprising as it has been the principal backer of the Hasina government for the past 14 years and practically contributed to the erosion of democracy in Bangladesh"". “The unqualified support to Sheikh Hasina has acted as a bulwark against any pressure on her for human rights transgressions. India has benefitted economically and seen Ms Hasina as the only way to keep the country within India’s sphere of influence.” India sees the current Bangladeshi opposition and its allies as “dangerous Islamic forces”. Ms Hasina cracked down on anti-India militants on her soil and granted transit rights to secure trade routes to five Indian states which border Bangladesh. “A peaceful, stable and prosperous Bangladesh is in India’s interests. India should do everything to ensure that those conditions are maintained. Essentially you want to keep peace and calm,” Harsh Vardhan Shringla, a former Indian foreign secretary and high commissioner to Bangladesh, told the BBC, hours before Ms Hasina resigned. For the moment, the situation is uncertain. ""India doesn’t have too many options at this point in time,"" a senior diplomat told the BBC. ""We have to tighten control on our borders. Anything else would be construed as interference"". Follow BBC India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook Bengali TV aired live footage of protesters storming Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's official residence. Bangladesh's embattled PM has resigned and fled to India amid massivem unprecedented protests. At current rates, India needs 75 years to reach a quarter of US's per capita income, a report says. The protests, which began as a student movement against job quotas, have spiralled into nationwide unrest. Lalita Kayi came to India 10 years ago to study yoga and meditation.

2,2024-08-06 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-06 05:36:42.000,Is the US really heading for recession?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgdd0xvxd7o,2024-08-05 14:27:30.000,"Over the past few days, global stock markets have been plummeting. Trading screens across the US, Asia and, to a certain extent, Europe are awash with blinking red numbers heading south. The sudden turn comes as fears grow that the US economy - the world's biggest - is slowing down. Experts say the main reason for this fear is that US jobs data for July, released on Friday, was much worse than expected. However, for some, talk of an economic slowdown - or even a (whisper it) recession - is a little premature. So, what did the official figures show us? As always with economics, there is good news and bad news. Bad news first. US employers created 114,000 jobs in July which was way below expectations of 175,000 new roles. The rate of unemployment also rose to 4.3%, a near three-year high, which triggered something known as the ""Sahm rule"". Named after American economist Claudia Sahm, the rule says if the average unemployment rate over three months is half a percentage point higher than the lowest level over the past 12 months then the country is at the beginning of a recession. In this case, the US unemployment rate rose in July, so the three-month average was 4.1%. That compares to the lowest level over the last year which was 3.5%. Adding to these concerns was the fact that the US Federal Reserve voted last week not to cut interest rates. Other central banks within developed economies, including the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, have recently cut interest rates. The Fed held borrowing costs but its chair, Jerome Powell, signalled that a cut in September was on the table. However, this led to speculation that the Fed had waited too long to act. A cut in interest rates means it is cheaper to borrow money which should, in theory, act as a boost to the economy. If the jobs figures suggest that the economy is already tipping downwards, then the fear is the Fed is too late. Then, on top of all this, are technology companies and their share prices. There has been a long-running rally in their shares, fuelled in part by optimism over artificial intelligence (AI). Last week, the chip-making giant Intel announced it was cutting 15,000 jobs. At the same time, market rumours suggested that rival Nvidia may have to delay the release of its new AI chip. What followed was a bloodbath on the Nasdaq, the technology-heavy US index. After hitting a high only a few weeks ago, it plunged by 10% on Friday. That helped pump-up the fear factor across markets and that's where danger could lie. If stock market panic continues and shares keep plunging the Fed could potentially step in before its next meeting in September and cut interest rates. This could happen, according to Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, if there is ""a market dislocation that deepens and starts to threaten systemically important institutions and/or broader financial stability"". Now for the good(-ish) news. “We are not in a recession now,"" according to Ms Sahm herself, inventor of the rule. She told CNBC on Monday that ""the momentum is in that direction"". But she added: “A recession is not inevitable and there is substantial scope to reduce interest rates.” Others are equivocal about the jobs data. ""While the report was bad it wasn’t that bad,"" said Mr Shearing. ""It is likely that Hurricane Beryl contributed to weakness in July’s payrolls figure. Other data painted a picture of a labour market that is cooling, but not collapsing,"" he said. He added that there appeared to be ""no increase in firings"" while a ""modest"" decline in average weekly hours worked in July ""does not scream 'recession'"". For Simon French, chief economist and head of research at Panmure Liberum, after digesting the US jobs data it's time to take a moment. ""Stepping back, have we suddenly re-appraised the health of the world’s biggest economy? No and nor should we."" But he added: ""It is another data point at a time when liquidity is thin and you’ve got a lot of things to worry about."" Iran has vowed to respond to the killing of Hamas' political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last week. The storm is now expected to bring heavy flooding to parts of Georgia and the Carolinas in the coming days. The attack comes as the US warns the Middle East is at a critical moment after the killings of Hamas and Hezbollah senior leaders.

2,2024-08-06 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-06 05:36:42.000,Russian dissident tells BBC he thought he would die in 'Putin's prison',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crg55g4z526o,2024-08-05 04:34:25.000,"“I was absolutely certain I would die in Putin’s prison.” It’s almost the first thing Vladimir Kara-Murza tells me after his surprise release in the biggest prisoner exchange since the Cold War. The Russian opposition politician is painfully thin – from stress, he says. He’s also still reeling from his abrupt transfer from a high security jail in Siberia into forced exile, after more than two years behind bars. “It’s surreal, like I’m watching a film,” he describes the feeling. “But it’s a good film,” in which he’s finally been reunited with the family he hasn’t seen since his arrest in Moscow in April 2022. His youngest son has been following him everywhere, anxious not to let him out of his sight. Vladimir Kara-Murza, who is also a British citizen, was convicted of treason and sentenced to 25 years for his fierce and persistent condemnation of Vladimir Putin and the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. He has spent the past 11 months straight in solitary confinement, made to fold away his bed each morning at 05:00 and only given paper and pen for an hour or so each day. “It’s so easy to lose your mind. You lose sense of time, space. Everything really,” he reveals, in one of his first long interviews since release. “You do nothing, speak to no one, go nowhere. Day after day after day.” He was denied phone calls home, only allowed to speak to his children twice in over two years. The added punishment was even tougher, physically. Almost a decade ago, Vladimir Kara-Murza nearly died from an unknown toxin and still suffers from after-effects, including nerve damage. In September, he now reveals, a prison doctor gave him ""a year, 18 months at best"" to live, if he stayed behind bars. “After two FSB poisonings, I don’t exactly have the right state of health for a strict regime prison,” he explains, with a wry smile.  Last week, Kara-Murza was one of eight Russian dissidents who went missing from their prisons. As lawyers and relatives sounded the alarm, rumours of a looming swap began to swirl. The prisoners themselves had no idea. Instead, when guards burst into Kara-Murza’s cell in Omsk he thought he would be “led out to be shot”, he recalls. “I actually thought they were going to execute me.” He’d recently been instructed to sign a request for a presidential pardon but refused to beg for mercy from Vladimir Putin, who he denounces as “a dictator, usurper and a murderer”. Kara-Murza was transferred to Moscow and the notorious Lefortovo FSB jail. Five days later he was led out to board a bus and saw the other dissidents inside, each one with an FSB guard in a balaclava. Another guard then took the bus microphone and announced they were being taken for a prisoner swap, no details. “No-one asked our consent,” Kara-Murza says. “We were loaded onto a plane like cattle and flown out.” The activist landed in Germany in the only civilian clothes he owned: black long-johns and T-shirt, and the flip flops he used for the prison shower. The Russian dissidents were part of a ""bundle"" of political prisoners released, along with high-profile US nationals like the journalist Evan Gershkovich. Three were former activists from the team of Alexei Navalny, the opposition politician who died suddenly in prison earlier this year. Originally, Navalny was to be part of the complex swap. In return for the dissidents, Russia got a handful of spies and criminals including the key prize sought by Vladimir Putin: an FSB hitman known as Vadim Krasikov who’d murdered in broad daylight in a Berlin park. The judge sentencing him to life in prison had called the killing an act of ""state terrorism"". “To everyone who criticises this [swap], I would respectfully urge them not to think of prisoner exchanges but of saving lives,” Kara-Murza argues, in response to the controversy over freeing Krasikov. The killer was welcomed home to a red carpet and a hug from Putin himself. “Aren’t 16 lives worth releasing one murderer?” For a long time, Germany wasn’t sure. The delay, Kara-Murza argues, may be what cost Alexei Navalny his life. The joy of the Kara-Murzas’ reunion is marred by thoughts of the Russian detainees who were not released. “I’m so happy and overwhelmed to see these people free, but also very sad so many people were left behind,” his wife Evgenia tells me. “I feel guilty.” Memorial human rights organisation lists hundreds of political prisoners and she had been campaigning hard for a priority group. “There are people with serious medical conditions, like Alexei Gorinov who’s missing part of his lung, who don’t have a lot of time.” Her husband talks of those ""still languishing in Putin’s Gulag"" and the hope of further exchanges. He had only been free himself for five minutes, when he strayed into controversy. In statements made soon after landing in Germany, Vladimir Kara-Murza argued that sanctions in relation to the Ukraine war should be better targeted. There was immediate uproar from Ukrainians who claimed his priority on walking free was to soften Russia’s punishment for waging war. Kara-Murza calls it calibration. “I need more information,” he admits. “I realise that February 2022 changed a lot.” But he wants to know why a Russian human rights lawyer can’t travel to the Baltic states for a conference, when a Russian missile containing a Western-made chip can slam into a residential building in Ukraine. “The responsibility for what the Putin regime is doing there is shared by Russian society, a large part of which chose to close their eyes to the abuses and repression,” he argues. “But let’s not forget the responsibility of those Western countries who for years preferred to deal with Vladimir Putin and do business, knowing full well who he was and what he represented.” In 2022, Vladimir Kara-Murza was arrested because he insisted on being inside Russia and speaking out. Now he’s barred from travelling, he worries about his right to call others there to action. He thinks he’ll feel ""more constrained"". But he will continue condemning the war on Ukraine. “Putin can’t be allowed to win this war. Ukraine must win, and there should be more support from Western countries so that happens,” he argues. Historically, he says, ""windows of opportunity"" for democratic change open after ""disastrous military defeat"". When his plane out of Russia was taking off, the FSB guard next to Kara-Murza told him to look out of the window. “He said it was the last time I was seeing my motherland.” The activist laughed. “I said, I’m a historian, so I am sure I will be back in my country.” “And it will be much quicker than you think.” Marc Fogel, 63, is serving a 14-year prison sentence in Russia and was excluded from the prisoner swap. With dissent snuffed out at home, Russia intensifies attacks on opponents seeking refuge in the West. Ukraine's military said it destroyed the Rostov-on-Don attack submarine in a missiles attack on Friday. The Dultsev children thought they were from Argentina and cannot speak Russian.

No, it’s not the Seine. And this isn’t Paris. That’s clear when we cruise past the Kremlin. Below deck, Tokyo 2020 gold medallist Mariya Lasitskene is taking part in the launch of an unusual project: a fusion athletics-fashion show-music event. Mariya is not in Paris defending her Olympic high jump title. Team Russia is barred from these Games because of the war in Ukraine. A World Athletics ruling means that track and field stars from Russia aren’t even allowed to compete as neutral athletes. And, for Mariya, that hurts. “I can’t even bring myself to follow the athletics at these Olympic Games,” she tells me. “It’s too painful. We should be there. The Olympics are a festival, the greatest event in the world.” The Russian press doesn’t seem to think so. From the get-go, newspapers here have been pouring cold water on Paris 2024. After an opening ceremony featuring drag artists and what some saw as a parody of Leonardo da Vinci’s The Last Supper, tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets dubbed the Paris Olympics ""The Games of Satan"". Another outlet, Argumenty i Fakty, has called them ""The Olympics of hell"". It’s starting to feel like Russia could win the gold... for sour grapes. “I thought the Olympic Games were about sport. No longer,” Russian MP Mariya Butina tells me. “It’s about politics, religion, everything. It’s very sad because the original idea of the Olympics was to create peace.” “But Russia has invaded Ukraine,” I point out. “That’s not ‘peace’, is it?” “Russia has been protecting its people,” Ms Butina responds, echoing the official line here that Russia’s war in Ukraine is all about self-defence. In reality, the Kremlin’s ""special military operation"" amounts to the invasion of a sovereign independent nation. In Russia, there was always huge interest in the Olympic Games. But these Olympics are not even being shown on TV here. That hasn’t happened since the Soviet Union boycotted the Los Angeles Olympics 40 years ago. Russia used to send hundreds of athletes to the Summer Games. This time round only 15 Russians have been competing in Paris as ""neutral athletes"" in sports like canoeing and tennis. They’re not allowed to present themselves a national team, so no Russian flags, no national anthem. And the individual athletes have had to undergo a vetting procedure to establish they have no links to the Russian military or security agencies and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. Bans in sport are nothing new for Russia. In 2019, the country was barred from major international sporting events for state-sponsored doping offences. That suspension was later reduced to two years. At the Tokyo Games, Russian athletes competed under the flag of the Russian Olympic Committee. There’s no vetting process at the sports festival I’m witnessing in a Moscow park. A Russian nationalist group has organised an afternoon of what it’s presenting as traditional Russian recreations. It is a world away from Paris 2024. I can see two men lying on the ground engaged in ""stick wrestling"", straining to pull their opponent over. What looks more like a gang fight is raging over on the football pitch, with teams in red and blue bibs engaged in ""wall-to-wall fighting"". Some things here have nothing in common with sport at all. Over in one corner, Russians, young and old, are being invited to don army fatigues and military gear. Posing with guns, they’re having their photographs taken. I detect little interest here in what is going on in Paris. “I haven’t followed the Olympics for ages,” wall-to-wall fighter Vadim tells me. “Not since Russia was excluded from it. Russia’s being cancelled everywhere.” For now, high jumper Mariya Lasitskene has her athletics-fashion show-music event to keep her busy. But Mariya concedes the Olympics are “every professional athlete’s dream"". “Every athlete wants to compete with the best. You can only do that at international competitions,” Mariya tells me. “Sport is the battle of the strongest. I do miss it.” Marc Fogel, 63, is serving a 14-year prison sentence in Russia and was excluded from the prisoner swap. With dissent snuffed out at home, Russia intensifies attacks on opponents seeking refuge in the West. Ukraine's military said it destroyed the Rostov-on-Don attack submarine in a missiles attack on Friday. The Dultsev children thought they were from Argentina and cannot speak Russian.

2,2024-08-06 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-06 05:36:42.000,Can 24-hour drinking zones transform a city?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckdgqpy0lyeo,2024-08-05 10:48:44.000,"When Frank Sinatra sang about “a city that never sleeps”, he probably wasn’t thinking about the economic boost that busy nightlife can provide to a metropolis. Yet a growing number of cities around the world are increasingly homing in on ways to strengthen their night-time economy. Around 100 cities now have some form of “night mayor” or “night tsar” in place, to spur this work. But most of those cities, including London, Sydney, and Sinatra’s beloved New York, are not up all night. In other words, they don’t allow bars and nightclubs to remain open, and serve alcohol, 24 hours a day. Nonetheless, later this year, Montreal - Canada’s second-largest city - is planning to take the leap into 24-hour nightlife. Following in the footsteps of Berlin and Tokyo, venues in a new all-night district in Montreal's city centre will be licensed to remain open, and serve alcohol, throughout the night. City officials say the move will bring in hundreds of millions of dollars in additional revenue. Currently bars and clubs in the city have to close by 3am. Montreal will become the first city in Canada to allow 24-hour drinking. In Toronto venues have to close by 2am, and it is 3am in Vancouver. In the US, Las Vegas and New Orleans have long allowed bars and clubs to stay open all night. While in New York the cut off time is 4am, and in Los Angeles it is 2am. On the other side of the Atlantic, pubs in London still typically close at 11pm. The city does, however, have a handful of nightclubs and bars that stay open all night, thanks to flexible licensing laws. On a warm Friday evening in July, the centre of Montreal is bustling; busy bars and restaurants line the wide, pedestrianised streets. “This is an opportunity for economic growth,” says Ericka Alneus, the city councillor behind the 24-hour plan. “But it’s also to present, and reinforce, the cultural scene.” In 2022, the annual financial value of Montreal’s nightlife was estimated to be worth C$2.25bn ($1.6bn; £1.3bn), according to advocacy group MTL 24/24. It says that from this, C$121m went in tax to the government. Clearly, Ms Alneus hopes those figures will increase when venues are allowed to stay open all night. But not everyone is supportive of the change: “We don’t have enough security for it,” says one concerned reveller. A fellow citizen is worried about the practical implications: “It’s nice for people who like to party, but the Metro closes at 1.30am,” she says. “There has to be some kind of way people can go back home.” Sergio Da Silva’s live music bar, Turbo Haus Club, is located on Saint Denis Street in Old Montreal. He says the planned changes haven’t been sufficiently considered. “You can't just say, 'here are some 24-hour bars, go nuts!'. ""There's no infrastructure to uphold it. There's no 24-hour public transport, there's no extra security. “Then, there’s the cost of living. If people can't afford to go out, no matter what 24-hour policy you put in, it doesn't change anything,” he adds. As the sun sets outside a different bar, L'ile Noire, owner Michel Lavallée disagrees - he has a different take on the closing-time situation. “In Montreal, we close at 3am. People are drunk at 1am - and they're super-drunk at 3am. “One of the problems we have is, at 3am it's like madness. But if you expand the hours, there’s less problems, less demand for security,” he explains. Ms Alneus agrees. She says the fact that so many bars and clubs all currently close at 3am presents problems for the police. She believes by allowing 24-hour drinking, those venues that don’t wish to stay open all night will be able to close at different times across the night. She maintains staggering closing time will bring “a bit more safety in nightlife areas”. Mirik Milan, a club promoter and festival organiser, was appointed as night mayor for Amsterdam in 2012. He says that during his six years in charge, alcohol-related violence and reports of nuisance fell by 20% and 30% respectively. Those statistics, he says, were vital for local politicians to demonstrate to voters that “we really managed the night in a better way”. Mr Milan has gone on to co-found VibeLab, a nightlife consultancy advising governments around the world. He says that when a city embraces nightlife as one of its key cultural assets, it can have billions of dollars of positive impact on the local economy. “It drives tourism. It brings in a lot of creative operators and businesses that want to be located in that city. And that has a huge impact on the city as a whole."" Lutz Leichsenring, co-founder at VibeLab, has been instrumental in promoting nightlife as part of Berlin’s Clubcommission - the organisation which, since 2000, has represented approximately 280 nightclubs in the German capital. “One of the strongest arguments for nightlife is that it attracts talented and skilled workers,” he says. “It's just a very important factor why people would relocate to a city, or would like to stay in a city and not move away."" Mr Leichsenring adds that the increased temperatures brought about by climate change will only make the nighttime economy more important during summer months for many cities. He maintains everything “from construction, to education, and cultural gatherings” will increasingly move to cooler nighttime hours. “The night needs to be governed better, because the more you shift to that - to the night - the more conflicts you create, because people also want to sleep at night.” Meanwhile, efforts to transform cities into all-night zones have – in some cases - proved disappointing. In 2017, London Mayor Sadiq Khan announced his 24-hour city proposal, appointing US comedian Amy Lamé “to champion nightlife”. Both were criticised earlier this year after suggesting they had succeeded in their vision, with social media-users expressing their frustration with the hashtag 'LameLondon' on X. The work of Sydney’s night mayor has also faced scepticism. Sticking to a nightlife plan isn’t always easy, particularly when governments change, says Jess Reia, assistant professor of data science at the University of Virginia. “The challenge is how to keep good policies after administration change - instead of having a pilot project for a few years, and then ending up with nothing,” she says. Back in Montreal, there is no start date yet for 24-hour opening. Ms Alneus says the intention is to launch some time in the autumn. ""We are trying to be trailblazers, and to push forward something that everybody enjoys."" she says. ""There are venues, artists, initiatives and performances at night-time that should have the light on them - for the economic growth of the city, but also for the cultural identity of Montreal.""

2,2024-08-06 07:36:50.000,BBC News,2024-08-06 05:36:42.000,Zambians mourn gospel singer popular in churches and clubs,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c72007nz6y2o,2024-08-04 23:14:56.000,"Some of Zambia’s top musicians have performed at a concert to mourn 46-year-old gospel singer Matthew Ngosa, a day before his burial in the capital, Lusaka. The audience joined in to belt out his beloved hits at the Praise Christian Centre. Such was the popularity of some of his songs that they were not only played in churches but also in nightclubs over a two-decade career. The venue in Lusaka was packed with fans, friends, family and government officials. His older brother Boyd, also a musician - popularly known as BJ - led mourners. Matthew started out singing with BJ and his younger brother Hezron when they were still at high school, often singing a cappella. They knew they wanted to make a career out of their music - not an easy ambition in a country where piracy means most musicians get little money from their music. Matthew and Hezron formed a duo called The Ezma Brothers within a larger group known as The Tribe Called Christians. Later, at Lusaka’s Northmead Assemblies of God Church, Matthew joined The Christ Ambassador Choir, where he polished his skills. In 2004 he released his highly successful debut album Umutima Wandi (My Heart), which dominated music charts. Gospel hits including Ukulolela (Waiting) and Ndakunkula (Rolling to God in Praise) followed - those two also becoming anthems for clubbers. Matthew Ngosa never made it rich, but was able to make a decent living from his hits before he was diagnosed with liver cancer in January. He died two days before he had been due to return to India for a check-up. Hezron told the BBC he would miss his brother’s sense of humour: “He would go out of his way to make people happy. He was very strong even in sickness. He was a man of faith.” This generosity of spirit was echoed by gospel musician Kings Mumbi. “To me, he was a mentor. When I recorded my first song, I took it to him to critique and that’s why I have never gone astray. He was more than a brother,” he told the BBC. “When a pastor invited Matthew Ngosa to their church to sing but couldn’t pay him, he would not bother that pastor because for Matthew, singing was part of his ministry. He took it as a way of spreading the word of God.” The development of Zambia’s music industry may suffer from piracy, but most Christians prefer buying original albums directly from the musicians as a way of promoting the growth of gospel music. Others believe that buying pirated gospel music is a sin that is tantamount to theft. “Your untimely death has crushed me, and broken the hearts of believers and shocked an entire nation,” televangelist and former Vice-President Nevers Mumba posted on Facebook after Ngosa’s death was announced on Friday. “My only consolation is that I know you will announce your arrival in heaven from Zambia in style. As you walk through that golden door, I can almost hear you singing with all the power that your vocal cords can manage.” His words reflect the outpouring of grief for Ngosa in Zambia, a largely Christian country where church attendance is high. President Hakainde Hichilema conveyed his message of condolences to the family while his predecessor Edgar Lungu visited the funeral house on Saturday. Ngosa, who had two daughters with Tasila Ngombe, once served as a civic leader in Mr Lungu’s party, the Patriotic Front. BJ told the BBC that their mother Samaria Maswela was fundamental to all three of the Ngosa brothers' careers. ""She used to sing in church and her own mother and father used to sing as well. Our mother is the one who introduced us to Sunday school music in the United Church of Zambia [UCZ] when we were still kids.” She joined BJ on stage towards the end of the three-hour concert on Sunday, with other tearful family members, to sing Matthew’s classic Umutima Wandi - a praise song in the Bemba language, thanking God for life’s blessings.
